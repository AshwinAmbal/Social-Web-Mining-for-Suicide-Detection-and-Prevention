Hey everyone,[BK][BK]This is just a friendly reminder that discussion of suicide can be really difficult for those who are going  through a tough time and may bring up some scary feelings.|d1y6p54|0
If you are feeling like you are not coping, please know that there are resources out there available to you.|d1y6p54|1
[BK][BK]There are [crisis services worldwide](https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/) that are trained to provide support.|d1y6p54|2
These centres are designed to give temporary relief from feelings that are overwhelming you and while they are unlikely to fix any underlying problems, can help you get through a tough hour/night/week.|d1y6p54|3
[BK][BK]Otherwise, if you feel like you may be suffering from a mental illness or your thoughts/feelings are making it hard to cope, I strongly recommend trying to find an appropriate professional in your area.|d1y6p54|4
Just as you would see a doctor when you are sick, you deserve to take care of your mental health.|d1y6p54|5
[BK][BK]Stay safe people.|d1y6p54|6
I started immediately crying because I thought everyone would hate me.|d1y6wks|7
Everyone was going to be angry at me now that they knew what I would done.|d1y6wks|8
[BK][BK]The doctor was kind enough to have me on no visitors for a while.|d1y6wks|9
Only doctors and nurses, who were all very very kind to me.|d1y6wks|10
I could not look most of them in the face when they came in.|d1y6wks|11
I felt embarrassed.|d1y6wks|12
Ashamed.|d1y6wks|13
Normal people want to live, right?|d1y6wks|14
The doctor, two therapists, and a nurse assured me that my family and friends would not hate me or be angry.|d1y6wks|15
They'd maybe be confused or a little sad, but they would be supportive.|d1y6wks|16
[BK][BK][BK]The saddest part?|d1y6wks|17
[BK][BK]I was right.|d1y6wks|18
They did all hate me.|d1y6wks|19
*all*.|d1y6wks|20
[BK]Did wonders for my depression, let me tell you!|d1y6wks|21
[BK]|d1y6wks|22
Maybe I should ask mom and dad for help if I cannot even get this right.|d1y5wc9|23
[BK][BK][BK]I was 12.|d1y5wc9|24
Well I had attempted to hang myself when I was 15.|d1y361f|25
I have a birth defect (deformed legs) and just could not take the bullying anymore.|d1y361f|26
So I got myself all strung up by a belt stuck in the door jam of my closet, stood up on a stool, and tried to get the courage to knock the stool over.|d1y361f|27
[BK][BK]Then I accidentally knocked the stool over.|d1y361f|28
[BK][BK]I hanged for about fifteen seconds, just long enough to make things start to go black.|d1y361f|29
And then the cheap plastic belt I was using broke.|d1y361f|30
"[BK][BK]I hit the ground and just yelled out loud 'OH FUCK'"" because 1."|d1y361f|31
The belt broke and I was still here, and 2.|d1y361f|32
Thank god the belt broke and I was still here.|d1y361f|33
[BK][BK]Edit: Thank you guys so much for your wonderful kind words and support.|d1y361f|34
As for what happened to the people who bullied me, one is in jail and the other is up to be a CEO.|d1y361f|35
No clue how that happened but oh well XD  [BK][BK]I have found something I am truly passionate about (comic books and animation) and things have been on a steady uphill climb.|d1y361f|36
And to anyone currently struggling, PLEASE PM ME!|d1y361f|37
Feel free to just rant or get something off your chest; I am no psychiatrist, but I *am* a very good listener.|d1y361f|38
"Keep your chin up guys! """|d1y361f|39
Bit late, but I tried hanging myself in my closet in the clothes rack.|d1y601v|40
I used a dressing gown rope which ultimately broke.|d1y601v|41
[BK][BK]When I regained consciousness I did not know where I was and my lamp light was very bright.|d1y601v|42
I had drool running down my chin.|d1y601v|43
When I got up it took me a minute or so to realise what had happened.|d1y601v|44
I guess I was in shock as I sort of just put on a movie and went about the rest of my night like nothing happened.|d1y601v|45
[BK][BK]It was during my psychologist appointment the next day the reality came crashing down on me and I broke down and was sent to the psychiatric ward[BK][BK]For a while I was so angry that I did not succeed and sometimes I still am.|d1y601v|46
I am alot better now although I still battle with suicidal thoughts and severe depression.|d1y601v|47
When I feel another bout coming on I choose little things to hang onto like the next episode of a tv show I like to come out or realising I need to read a book series.|d1y601v|48
[BK][BK]|d1y601v|49
Just never really saw the point of living as a kid.|d1y6y5a|50
I always watched the news and read things that a kid probably should not have been reading.|d1y6y5a|51
Agonizing over every horror in the world.|d1y6y5a|52
I can remember being six or seven and reading articles on tensions in the middle east(like those are new!)|d1y6y5a|53
then watching the news and hearing that we were minutes from nuclear war and just thinking, 'So, why?|d1y6y5a|54
"'""[BK][BK]I would lie in bed and spend hours trying to imagine what it would be like to be dead."|d1y6y5a|55
To be nothing.|d1y6y5a|56
It was scary at first but then it just seemed better.|d1y6y5a|57
I had friends and was popular.|d1y6y5a|58
I was college bound and gifted in academics and the arts but every night I would close my eyes and try to be dead.|d1y6y5a|59
Hoping that if I could lock my mind in on what it was like it would welcome me.|d1y6y5a|60
[BK][BK]Fast forward a few years and I had just lost a job I hated, felt like my parents and family hated me.|d1y6y5a|61
I went to the beach one afternoon and decided it was just time to be done with it.|d1y6y5a|62
I had a prescription for a powerful sleeping aid so the method was clean and easy.|d1y6y5a|63
I came home, boxed everything up so no one would be inconvenienced by having to sift through my things, wrote a letter expressing my deep sense of hopelessness and apologizing to everyone for every small wrong I would committed, outlined a brief will, carefully folded the letter as to make sure it would fit perfectly into the envelope I had labeled **DNR**, and washed down the pills I had with whiskey.|d1y6y5a|64
"[BK][BK]Woke up or rather regained any sense of consciousness eighteen or so hours later and sat there feeling like shit and screamed, '""Are you fucking kidding me?"|d1y6y5a|65
"'""[BK][BK]I have no idea how I did not die and it still kind of pisses me off."|d1y6y5a|66
I have not gained any sense of enlightenment or hope.|d1y6y5a|67
I am not suicidal anymore and while I think about being dead often the periods between such thoughts are longer as I get older.|d1y6y5a|68
[BK][BK]Even as I experience success in life and allow my creativity to come out more than I did that voice is still there:  *This is pointless.|d1y6y5a|69
No one is going to remember.|d1y6y5a|70
No one is going to care.|d1y6y5a|71
Everyone is in transit and all things are fleeting.|d1y6y5a|72
* it got easier to not listen after I unpacked those boxes and burned that envelope.|d1y6y5a|73
[BK][BK]I talked to a therapist about it but I could see the look in her eyes and knew there were no answers.|d1y6y5a|74
She would prescribe something that would not fix anything.|d1y6y5a|75
It would just change the nature of my misery.|d1y6y5a|76
[BK][BK]I have happy moments but they are always stained with the awareness of everything that is wrong, everyone who is in pain, and that in the end none of this really matters.|d1y6y5a|77
I doubt I am less sad.|d1y6y5a|78
"I think I have just gotten used to it."""|d1y6y5a|79

"'Fuck, This is embarrassing'""[BK][BK]I tried to kill myself on the 1st of February this year, I am currently staying in University halls, the way I tried to kill myself was just to down a bunch of alcohol."|d1ydkq8|81
That was the first thought that popped into my head and I obviously was not thinking straight.|d1ydkq8|82
I drank a full bottle of wine, three bottles of cider, two beers in the space of about 10 minutes.|d1ydkq8|83
"I hoped that if I drank them fast enough (I am only 5'""2 and about 120 pounds.)"|d1ydkq8|84
I would get alcohol poisoning.|d1ydkq8|85
But alas I just got super drunk and emotionally messaged my boyfriend what I had done, went to the bathroom and smashed my head on the sink intentionally in the hopes of giving myself brain damage, then passed out in his room.|d1ydkq8|86
I awoke to paramedics standing around me doing all sorts of tests.|d1ydkq8|87
(Blood pressure, sugar levels etc etc.)|d1ydkq8|88
They asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital and I said no, they could not force me and since I was not in any actual danger they had to leave.|d1ydkq8|89
"[BK][BK]It was embarrassing for me because I am a very awkward person and quite a lot of people in the halls had seen this commotion and wondered what was going on, two people who were not my boyfriend actually saw me passed out on the bed."""|d1ydkq8|90
It was less of a conscious attempt, but once I took about 20 or so sleeping pills and a few benadrylls.|d1y5bqg|91
I wound up starting to hallucinate extremely vividly to the point I could not differentiate reality from the hallucinations.|d1y5bqg|92
I was tripping the fuck out, at one point trying to make myself throw up cause I began to worry.|d1y5bqg|93
Eventually I passed out.|d1y5bqg|94
"Woke up the next morning... [BK] [BK]'Wow I feel well rested as fuck'"""""|d1y5bqg|95
No throwaway please excuse Grammer and format I am just putting this out there.|d1y5lwr|96

I deal with ptsd and depression at the time I was dealing with my issues that I hid after coming home from over seas my divorce and I was getting close to losing my apartment I got drunk as hell got in a fight with my then girlfriend I racked my shotgun with my girl in the room and her daughter in the room next to us and pulled the trigger.|d1y5lwr|98
The shell was sitting on the floor and the shotgun did not discharge.|d1y5lwr|99
I was put in hand cuffs and had the police surrounding me with weapons drawn.|d1y5lwr|100
I tried to fight but gave up.|d1y5lwr|101
I was loaded in to an ambulance and taken to the hospital.|d1y5lwr|102
The sergeant walked in to my room and said you are a lucky son of a bitch and showed me the shell that should have killed me.|d1y5lwr|103
I spent a week in the psychological ward.|d1y5lwr|104
The things I saw there were worse then iraq.|d1y5lwr|105
I saw people shit the last selves and use it like make up.|d1y5lwr|106
My first thought when the fog cleared was I should have died and the barrel of that shotgun still looked oddly tasty.|d1y5lwr|107
Today I  am not doing the best but I want to live.|d1y5lwr|108
Mental heath is no joke and we need to look at it a lot better.|d1y5lwr|109

Immense guilt.|d1y9jqw|120
[BK][BK]I was 13.|d1y9jqw|121
I would been raped by a man.|d1y9jqw|122
I could not get my head right.|d1y9jqw|123
I overdosed on everything I could find and went to bed to die.|d1y9jqw|124
My next memory is laying in bed on the hospital ward with my dad next to the bed.|d1y9jqw|125
He looked at me and asked: 'this was not because of me was it?|d1y9jqw|126
"'""[BK][BK]I will never forget the guilt I felt in that moment."|d1y9jqw|127
He''d been sat there all night scared shitless that his son might die and - wrongly - that he might somehow be the cause of it.|d1y9jqw|128
He''s not what you had call an emotional man; he is gruff, pragmatic, conservative.|d1y9jqw|129
Seeing the tears in his eyes and hearing his voice crack... it will stay with me.|d1y9jqw|130
[BK][BK]20 more years later, that guilt is what stops going through with it now.|d1y9jqw|131
I stand at the platform edge waiting for the tube train to roll in, or walking over Waterloo bridge on my way home, and I wish I had it in me to jump.|d1y9jqw|132
I even went to Canada to try, hoping that the distance would somehow ameliorate the memory.|d1y9jqw|133
But I feel such guilt ... for my family and friends... who, despite whatever note I might leave, would be caused immense grief.|d1y9jqw|134
[BK][BK]Don''t do it kids.|d1y9jqw|135

"'This is either hell, or the worst hangover ever'"" after a ton of under the counter sleeping meds with two bottles of whiskey."|d1y7wnr|137
Woke up on the ground after apparently locking my room.|d1y7wnr|138
I could feel how dry my eyes were from the crying.|d1y7wnr|139
"[BK][BK]I checked myself in the mirror and my only reaction was '""please, just tell me it is over'"" and then I burst out in barely dry heaving tears."|d1y7wnr|140
[BK][BK]As soon as that was done I went back to my room and double checked.|d1y7wnr|141
Yep, two bottles of cheap whiskey, no puke, all the meds taken, what had gone wrong?!|d1y7wnr|142
[BK][BK]Charge up my phone, see that it is been a whole day and a half of me being passed out, my housemates (busy with studies so not in the house) asking whether I want to join them for a pint.|d1y7wnr|143
[BK][BK]Definite no and up to this day I have yet to mention this all new low I reached to anybody.|d1y7wnr|144
It was despicable.|d1y7wnr|145
Driven by hatred, scorn, alcoholism, egoism and all the vile things that a human at the bare age of 20 can acquire.|d1y7wnr|146
"[BK][BK]And then it hit me, with an extremely slow delay, '""Fuck this, if everything can fuck me over viciously in completely undeserved ways, I can do better on its own terms by proving to be the victor.'"""|d1y7wnr|147
[BK][BK]And that is exactly what I strive for nowadays, proving that there is a point to it.|d1y7wnr|148
"Even though I still despise every second of my life, I found meaning in seeing my close friends smile, having deep and meaningful conversations, struggling to become better not for me, but for the people who care about me, because that is what happiness proved to be for me in the end.

After the click of the pistol, I sat there in a state of shock.|d1y9iyo|150
I do not know what really happened.|d1y9iyo|151
I swear I saw an angel floating in front of me, and that is why the gun misfired.|d1y9iyo|152
My first conscious thought was I needed help.|d1y9iyo|153
[BK][BK]The chaos of war while I was in Iraq, the ungodly vivid memories of the smell of rot and the way the skin of the water logged bodies slopped off in my hand while I was deployed to New Orleans for Katrina; and every life threatening mission I was on was going to kill me if I did not get help.|d1y9iyo|154

I have been suicidal since I was little tiny.|d1ye6dv|163
Common events like riding home from church would have me looking wistfully at the door handle, thinking how easy it would be to slip out onto the highway.|d1ye6dv|164
[BK][BK]I only acted on it after a situation went from physically abusive to emotionally ridiculous (I was 18, and my much larger brother unexpectedly turned and started wailing on me, pinning me down, repeatedly punching me in the face.|d1ye6dv|165
The part that really hurt was my mom walked down after hearing me screaming, saw puddles of blood, and did not stand up for me.|d1ye6dv|166
Even though my brother had his own place a couple hours away, he stayed at home, just watching T.V.|d1ye6dv|167
with the family like it was a normal evening.)|d1ye6dv|168
[BK][BK]Back to the topic, I felt so overwhelmed that I created a concoction that obviously failed.|d1ye6dv|169
[BK][BK]I never told them.|d1ye6dv|170
I decided to pack my things and move in with my boyfriend (who was a piece of shit).|d1ye6dv|171
We lived together for almost a year before I could no longer stand his drug dealing, and inability to pay rent.|d1ye6dv|172
I moved back home where I was treated like the prodigal son, because to the outside world I had simply shacked up with my loser boyfriend.|d1ye6dv|173
[BK][BK]I have never told anyone the full story.|d1ye6dv|174
Kind of embarrassing.|d1ye6dv|175
"Kind of an 'impostor syndrom'"" thing going on."|d1ye6dv|176
[BK][BK]I am married with two kids, and I have not had a suicidal thought in about five years.|d1ye6dv|177
I guess because I have been busy doing life.|d1ye6dv|178

I have done a lot of drugs, but nothing feels stranger than ODing on benadryl.|d1yhusm|184
The idea of quantum suicide is what really kept me from trying again.|d1yhusm|185
If there is always a version of myself that survives the attempt, and that is the one I experience every time, then there really is no point in trying to kill myself.|d1yhusm|186
I am gonna die when I die and there is nothing I can do to make it happen any faster.|d1yhusm|187
Except smoke cigarettes and do as many drugs as possible.|d1yhusm|188

It was snowing that day, and I was too early to get into work, so I thought I would treat myself to a nice, hot breakfast nearby.|d1yk1ui|198
After ordering, my phone buzzed.|d1yk1ui|199
I was that person eating alone in a crowded restaurant who burst out into tears out of fear, confusion, frustration.|d1yk1ui|200
I decided to rush to work.|d1yk1ui|201

They were lucky to not have to witness that; I could have ruined that bus driver''s life, and the lives of the other passengers.|d1yk1ui|208
Sure, it would have been a mistake in their minds.|d1yk1ui|209
[BK][BK]Then I thought about what would happen if it did not kill me.|d1yk1ui|210
I could be paralyzed, brain dead, or comatose.|d1yk1ui|211
I could have made my life worse.|d1yk1ui|212
[BK][BK]I finished work that day, and went to get tested.|d1yk1ui|213
Over a year later, and my results are still negative; I do not have HIV.|d1yk1ui|214
I still struggle with the events that led up to the scare.|d1yk1ui|215
I have since lost two people to suicide; a coworker''s daughter who was brought into work with us several times, and my second boyfriend.|d1yk1ui|216
The fact that I opened myself up to dating again after the first experience, only to lose my closest friend two days after he had the courage to ask me out, was devastating.|d1yk1ui|217
But the pain I still carry with me to this very moment is keeping me here.|d1yk1ui|218
I cannot do that to anyone, strangers or family.|d1yk1ui|219

[BK][BK]So I give myself the biggest dose that I could at one time, 60 units of fast acting insulin (it usually takes care of around 600g of carbs) and instantly regret it, so I run to the corner store across the street and get like 4 liters of sodas, and assorted chocolate bars, and dial for a Chinese delivery that arrived about 20 mins later.|d1y553m|227
I got an odd look from the delivery guy as I start eating the chow mein right in front of him.|d1y553m|228

I drove down a major road which ends in a roundabout.|d20z73s|255
I pressed the gas till I was going 150 (km/h) then pulled the steering as hard as I could.|d20z73s|256
I closed my eyes when I did it, and did it when I was entering the roundabout...|d20z73s|257
It was night, so there were no other cars.|d20z73s|258
[BK][BK]The fucking thing did not flip.|d20z73s|259
It spun around and almost slammed into the fence.|d20z73s|260
The first thing I remember, was the terror.|d20z73s|261
Once I yanked the wheel I was terrified it was really happening, and when the screeching stopped I looked up, and it was as though in the aftermath of a cataclysm.|d20z73s|262
I saw the smoke, the tire tracks, the stars above (cabrio banger), realized I was still alive, and could not begin to understand how was that possible.|d20z73s|263
I stayed in a trance like state, until my senses returned to normal, still hearing the music playing.|d20z73s|264
Eventually, some other people drove in the roundabout and were honking at me since I looked as though I would thrown the car about, which made me snap out of the trance.|d20z73s|265
"[BK][BK]'You could have pressed the gas harder'"" was the first thought, followed by guilt over thinking, I would just left my friend''s house."|d20z73s|266
How would it have been for them, to get a call in the morning that I died in a car crash just as I was leaving their house?|d20z73s|267
How would it have been for my parents to hear that I killed myself in a foreign country?|d20z73s|268
[BK][BK] The guilt almost made me throw up, but it also forced me to realize that I have a hell of a lot to lose if I go through with that again, and that death is the one thing that cannot be taken back.|d20z73s|269
I still do not know how is it possible to be still alive.|d20z73s|270
How did I make it without a scratch; but in them 3 seconds when I was expecting to go head first with 2 tonnes of metal on top of me, the fear of losing my life was greater than the wish to die.|d20z73s|271
"Never tried it since, and although I had thoughts after that moment, and impulses, I never took them seriously ever again, having known that fear and guilt."""|d20z73s|272
I swallowed two full bottles of seroquel, went to sleep, and woke up in the ICU .|d1ybmzh|273
My mom had a weird urge to check on me in the middle of the night and found me unconcious and hardly breathing.|d1ybmzh|274
"I opened my eyes and saw her and she said 'how could you do this to me'"" and i remember shutting my wyes really tight and hottest sadest tear rolled down my face and i thought the same thing."|d1ybmzh|275
I was crushed that I was still alive.|d1ybmzh|276
[BK][BK]I can still remember that pain over the pain of giving birth to my daughter.|d1ybmzh|277

Posted my story in a similar thread a while ago, my first thought though was that I wanted to watch some Star Wars, so I cleaned myself up and went to it.|d1y58i0|281
Story is as follows:[BK][BK]My plan was to take a bunch of my parent's old hydrocodones and drink Southern Comfort until I passed out.|d1y58i0|282
Call it cowardice or whatever you will, but as young and as dumb as I was I started drinking before I took the pills.|d1y58i0|283
About half way down the bottle I choked down 8 tabs and chugged as much as I could.|d1y58i0|284
[BK][BK]To make a long story short, I blacked out and at some point barfed up the pills.|d1y58i0|285
Woke up slumped against a wall at 4:30 am on Sunday, February 21, 2010.|d1y58i0|286
[BK][BK]To this day I live my life as if I were supposed to already be dead.|d1y58i0|287
To me each day is a gift, and I choose to take each gift as an earnest sign that I have something to do on this Earth.|d1y58i0|288
I do not consider myself to be the same person that chose to take his life that Saturday night.|d1y58i0|289
When my eyes opened to the black basement of my house I knew that I had changed.|d1y58i0|290
[BK][BK]That said.|d1y58i0|291
You must pay attention to those around you whom you hold dear.|d1y58i0|292
If you suspect someone is contemplating suicide do not leave them in the dark.|d1y58i0|293
And please, if you are considering suicide, do not attempt.|d1y58i0|294
I cannot stress this enough.|d1y58i0|295
I beg of you to please seek help.|d1y58i0|296
I decided to hang myself with an extension cord in the rafters of my garage.|d1y3hct|297
I decided to do a quick test run to make sure the beam would hold before saying my goodbyes to my family.|d1y3hct|298
During the test run, I slipped off my chair and actually hung myself.|d1y3hct|299
The panic I felt during those few moments I was dangling was all it took to convince myself I should live.|d1y3hct|300
I needed desperately to tell my mother I loved her before I went.|d1y3hct|301
My father too.|d1y3hct|302
I could only think of getting out of it, so I could give them their well deserved goodbyes, and let them know how much I loved them.|d1y3hct|303
When I luckily managed to get my footing back on the chair, I realized I was not ready to go.|d1y3hct|304
I had so much love left in me.|d1y3hct|305
I felt like it gave me a second chance to realize I did not want to go through with it.|d1y3hct|306
I am doing well now.|d1y3hct|307
I have two beautiful girls, and a man who would give me the moon.|d1y3hct|308
I am happy I had a botched run, because I am sure I would not have realized how i really felt if I got to text my final goodbyes.|d1y3hct|309
[BK][BK]EDIT: Wow guys.|d1y3hct|310
I was really unsure about sharing this, to be completely honest, and nearly deleted it still after posting.|d1y3hct|311
This morning I woke up to so much compassion, and so many kind words, I am awestruck.|d1y3hct|312
People are awesome.|d1y3hct|313
You guys are awesome.|d1y3hct|314
Thank you so much for being the sort of people who give others hope and inspiration.|d1y3hct|315

Really.|d1y3hct|317
Not so much a thought, more the realization that my mother was not upset because I had just tried to kill myself but was angry because the rope had dug deeply into the ceiling rafter and ruined the paint before it snapped.|d1y24a1|318
Posted this before but I will go again.|d1ybenm|319
"[BK]My first actual conscious thought was 'Wow, I am so weak I cannot even kill myself.'"""|d1ybenm|320
"A few moments later my thoughts were '""I am so strong, I cannot even kill myself.'"""|d1ybenm|321
Shit changed my life.|d1ybenm|322
"Started viewing the world down the lines of '""What does not kill me only makes me stronger.'"""|d1ybenm|323
"now I push myself to my limits and try things that I am afraid of. """|d1ybenm|324
It's actually a funny story.|d1y86y2|325
I hung myself.|d1y86y2|326
But the rope broke after I would passed out.|d1y86y2|327
I came-to on the floor.|d1y86y2|328
I sat up and felt something wet on the back of my scalp.|d1y86y2|329
It was blood.|d1y86y2|330
I would hit my head on the corner of a dresser.|d1y86y2|331
There was a nice pool of blood forming.|d1y86y2|332
I freaked out and called 911 because I would split my scalp open.|d1y86y2|333
Here I was, ready to die, and now I was scared that I was going to bleed to death.|d1y86y2|334
I will say, there was a young male medic that was with the group that showed up.|d1y86y2|335
He walked into the room and came back out white as a sheet.|d1y86y2|336
He did not like seeing the broken rope hanging from the beam.|d1y86y2|337
It really freaked him out.|d1y86y2|338
So I made up my mind to never attempt suicide.|d1y86y2|339
If a complete stranger reacted like that, I could only imagine how the person would feel who found me.|d1y86y2|340
I just could not do that to anyone ever again.|d1y86y2|341
As for the split scalp, I received   fourteen stitches.|d1y86y2|342
Serves me right.|d1y86y2|343
"'Should have used a better rope, I need a reason to explain my neck'"""""|d1ybmww|344
I took a huge aspirin overdose, about 200 pills, and then got into bed and waited to fall asleep.|d1y8vkb|345
However, sleep did not come.|d1y8vkb|346
Hours passed, I developed stomach pains and the pains got worse.|d1y8vkb|347
I became sweaty and agitated and tossed and turned.|d1y8vkb|348
After several hours, I realised I was not going to fall asleep.|d1y8vkb|349
I realised I would be awake while dying, and it might take days.|d1y8vkb|350
The pain was already so bad that I realised I could not take that.|d1y8vkb|351
I had no choice but to go and wake my mother up and tell her what I would done.|d1y8vkb|352
I stood outside her bedroom door for ages, trying to summon up the courage to go in and tell her what I would done.|d1y8vkb|353
It was just awful.|d1y8vkb|354
We went to the hospital, and I was taken through immediately.|d1y8vkb|355
It was too late to pump my stomach, I had to be put on a drip and given activated charcoal to drink instead.|d1y8vkb|356
But the aspirin had really taken hold and I became terribly confused and spent the next few days having audio and visual hallucinations, and often not being sure where I was or what was going on.|d1y8vkb|357
When I came back to reality, I think my first conscious thought was hurt and dismay that everybody - medical staff, friends and family - were being so unsympathetic and downright nasty to me because of what I would done.|d1y8vkb|358
I was given no psychiatric help, just discharged after my physical ailments had been seen to.|d1y8vkb|359
I was 17 years old.|d1y8vkb|360
I am 32 now and despite repeated requests, still have not received any psychiatric help.|d1y8vkb|361
I would still commit suicide now if I could find a sure-fire way of doing it.|d1y8vkb|362
this happened in the UK if anyone is wondering.|d1y8vkb|363
The NHS is fucking useless for dealing with this sort of thing, and my family are totally unsupportive.|d1y8vkb|364
First thought three months ago when I was discovered and involuntarily admitted to hospital: “Fuck off.|d1y7elx|365
I don’t want your help.|d1y7elx|366
I just want to die.|d1y7elx|367
I don’t want to be at a hospital, I want to be dead.”[BK]First thought when the rope snapped a month ago: “All that pain to my neck for nothing.|d1y7elx|368
How the hell did that slip?|d1y7elx|369
I’ll leave it up and try again tomorrow.” [BK]No feelings of regret, shame, or guilt here folks; just incomprehensible anger that I still didn’t/still haven’t succeeded.|d1y7elx|370
The first time I was rather young, so when I cut myself and did not bleed, I freaked out and decided ''the universe'' was not going to let me kill myself.|d1y1xq8|371
"Turns out, you can totally cut yourself and not bleed for a variety of reasons; but I thought I had tried to cheat some divine plan and not bleeding out was the cosmos saying 'nice try, but not today'""."|d1y1xq8|372
[BK][BK]The second time was a few years later with a handful of pills.|d1y1xq8|373
I woke up two days later.|d1y1xq8|374
I was super groggy and dehydrated, took me a few minutes to figure out my muscles again to stand.|d1y1xq8|375
"First thought after I stood up and realized it was a completely different time of day was definitely '""Well..."|d1y1xq8|376
"fuck.'"""|d1y1xq8|377
And then, of course, remembering the first time, and this time thinking that the universe was rather cruel for not letting me die, again.|d1y1xq8|378
[BK][BK]I have made plans twice since.|d1y1xq8|379
A few years ago when I had been abandoned by my father and abused by his most recent girlfriend, I had decided on a method and had begun writing final goodbye letters.|d1y1xq8|380
After sending out the first one, my grandparents called me up and ''talked me off the ledge''.|d1y1xq8|381
I had a deep, heavy, ugly cry.|d1y1xq8|382
I could not do it, knowing someone actually cared about me.|d1y1xq8|383
[BK][BK]Last month, I started planning again.|d1y1xq8|384
Things have been hard.|d1y1xq8|385
This is all very upsetting for my shrink, who has not been much help.|d1y1xq8|386
She pleaded with me not to go through with it, so...|d1y1xq8|387
I have been self medicating pretty hard on top of my anti-depressants.|d1y1xq8|388
[BK][BK]It keeps the demons at bay.|d1y1xq8|389
[BK][BK]Edit: Well this got much, much bigger than anticipated.|d1y1xq8|390
I had a good cry over all the incredibly positive feedback.|d1y1xq8|391
I do not really have it in me to give meaningful replies to everyone, but thank you.|d1y1xq8|392
[BK][BK]My last session with my current shrink is tomorrow, but I do not have anything else lined up yet.|d1y1xq8|393
Mental health care is not cheap, even in some nationalized systems, and living in the US... well, if you cannot afford to be healthy, you are not.|d1y1xq8|394
[BK][BK]I am not actively planning to kill myself anymore.|d1y1xq8|395
Like I said, I have just.. stepped up the drugs.|d1y1xq8|396
Weed is legal in this state, but I still feel like a useless addict because it is one of the only things that can make me immune to despair for a few hours.|d1y1xq8|397
[BK][BK]I cannot afford school anymore, and I have accepted that, once more sweeping my broken dreams into the box of things best not dwelt upon.|d1y1xq8|398
I am just going to find a job I can get by on, and hopefully get a cat; and maybe having something to love and love me back will help fill the void a bit.|d1y1xq8|399

The first thing I remember is being in the  ambulance with them forcing me to drink something disgusting.|d1y974s|401
[BK][BK]Next thing I remember is laying in a room on a table or something begging the nurses to just let me die.|d1y974s|402
I kept saying 'please let me die, why will not you let me die.|d1y974s|403
"Everyone would be so much happier if you just let me die.'"""|d1y974s|404
[BK][BK]Then I was in a room in the cardiac Ward with an aide who was not allowed to leave my side.|d1y974s|405
[BK][BK]It was a horrible experience, they were overly full in the psych ward.|d1y974s|406
I saw a psych doctor once and they released me within 48 hours.|d1y974s|407
I spent the next four years in deep depression until I got tired of them experimenting with meds and feeling like I wanted to die.|d1y974s|408
I finally broke down and told my mom that I have wanted to die for years and that this weekend either I am killing myself or something is happening to fix it.|d1y974s|409
[BK][BK]She took me into my urgent care and I talked to this sweet older grandfatherly doctor.|d1y974s|410
He very kindly explained that I needed more help than he could give me.|d1y974s|411
That I needed to go home and pack a bag for a week away.|d1y974s|412
He was going to call the hospital and tell them that I would be there within an hour and a half.|d1y974s|413
[BK][BK]Going home and telling my husband and children that I was going away for at least a week was the second hardest thing I have ever done.|d1y974s|414
[BK][BK]When we got to the hospital they were full, luckily I WANTED help so they were able to send me to the voluntary Ward at the UW.|d1y974s|415
I will be forever grateful to them.|d1y974s|416

[BK][BK]My first feeling was not relief, it was more anger and pain.|d1y4tlx|465
I felt like a bigger failure than I already felt, and since I was handcuffed to a hospital bed and on my way to a psychiatric hospital, the tremendous weight of the process I had to now go through was overwhelming.|d1y4tlx|466
I was in a locked facility for 17 days, and I lied to every doctor evaluating me the whole time.|d1y4tlx|467
Told them I regretted what I did, that I wanted to live, that the incident seemed like it happened forever ago, blah blah blah.|d1y4tlx|468

The truth was I was playing for a quick release so I could go home and do the job properly.|d1y4tlx|470
[BK][BK]I obviously did not.|d1y4tlx|471
The way my mother cried when she visited me in the hospital has stopped me so far.|d1y4tlx|472
Also, my best friend''s mother, whom I love like my own family, gave me the best advice I got during that time.|d1y4tlx|473
"I was talking to her about what happened, and I was kind of beating around the bush explaining what happened, and she stopped me and just said 'own it'""."|d1y4tlx|474

[BK][BK]So here''s my advice to you if you are reading this all the way at the bottom of some Reddit thread.|d1y4tlx|476
If your life seems worthless and you hate yourself and you see no point in living, the hard fucking truth is you are right.|d1y4tlx|477
I am not going to sit here and beg you to get help.|d1y4tlx|478
You have a choice to make, so make it.|d1y4tlx|479
But remember that killing yourself has consequences for your family, friends, community.|d1y4tlx|480

Own who you are.|d1y4tlx|482

At first I tried to tell my family it was just a really heavy night of drinking etc etc, but I eventually broke down and told them everything while we were in the hospital.|d1y32vk|488
I do not really remember much about those few days I was in a coma, I 100 percent swear I saw 2 people sitting next to me, and talking to me at one point, but all of my family and the doctors say there was nobody there.|d1y32vk|489
I did not believe them, so they showed me the security footage of the time I swear 2 people were there, and on the screen there was nobody, it was a very surreal though (for those wondering yes I do believe in God, but that is not about this post).|d1y32vk|490
After I told them all what happened, and was finally released from the hospital I moved back to my home town.|d1y32vk|491

Now I float round everyday, waiting for the ideal time to try again.|d1y2qd4|510
[BK][BK]EDIT - thank you for all the support.|d1y2qd4|511
Regarding the situations leading up to my attempt, I came to the sudden realization that I am one in six billion, an insignificant speck in the grand scheme of things.|d1y2qd4|512
This is an overwhelming concept and I am still trying to confront this problem.|d1y2qd4|513
"I am not sure if I can handle another 60 years of insignificance."""|d1y2qd4|514
Who's talking to me?|d1y1xh8|515
(Was my family Dr) Of course I know what year it is and what my name is.|d1y1xh8|516
(She was asking tons of questions)  Why are my arms and legs restrained.|d1y1xh8|517
(Apparently I attacked the nurses and Drs)|d1y1xh8|518
Honestly, my first thought was fuck, now I have to clean this up.|d1y1vd6|519
My second though was, I am kinda glad I am not dead.|d1y1vd6|520
[BK][BK]Before anyone can ask, I cut my wrists.|d1y1vd6|521
Deep enough to need stitches that I did not get, but not deep enough to die apparently.|d1y1vd6|522
That was eight years ago.|d1y1vd6|523
I am so thankful I did not succeed.|d1y1vd6|524
I am grateful for my life now.|d1y1vd6|525
I have an amazing fiance, a beautiful God daughter, and a fantastic best friend.|d1y1vd6|526
[BK]All I can say is, if you are feeling like suicide is your only option, it is not.|d1y1vd6|527
Seek help and support.|d1y1vd6|528
Life sucks, but it does get better.|d1y1vd6|529
What my mom's reaction would have been if she had found my lifeless body swinging from the rafter on her way to get her work clothes out of the laundry.|d1y4po2|530
Her trying to explain what had happened to my little sister.|d1y4po2|531
Above all, the thing I remember the most was the momement when I kicked the stool out from under me and felt weightless for a split second and realized that every problem I had, every situation I was in, except for the one I had just put myself in, was not permanent and could be fixed.|d1y4po2|532
After the first attempt: Fuck.|d1ydf5l|533
Still here.|d1ydf5l|534
[BK][BK]Second attempt: How did that not work?!|d1ydf5l|535
What the fuck!|d1ydf5l|536
[BK][BK]Third attempt: Alright, there is probably a reason for this.|d1ydf5l|537
Maybe I should do that whole 'keep on keeping on' thing and figure it out.|d1ydf5l|538
[BK][BK]Almost had a fourth attempt, gun was under my chin.|d1ydf5l|539
Only thing that saved me was that I did not know how this woman I was developing a  relationship with would find out.|d1ydf5l|540
We'd just begun talking through text and Skype, and I had not told her how I felt about get, yet.|d1ydf5l|541
So I put the gun down and got a tattoo instead.|d1ydf5l|542
Death's Head Moth on my hand to signify the change in my life.|d1ydf5l|543
And now, we have got plans to live together by the end of the year (hopefully) and we are trying to bring life into this world.|d1ydf5l|544
Hopefully this is not too buried, and someone reads this.|d1ydf5l|545
It honestly does get better.|d1ydf5l|546
Daniella, if you see this, I have loved you from the first day, you chase away my dark clouds.|d1ydf5l|547
You're the best thing to ever happen to my life.|d1ydf5l|548

[BK][BK]after realizing i could not end my own life, and saw how difficult it is to end a life, and its not as easy as it sounds, and saw for myself thats its not really an easy way out, i realized something very important.|d1y5d8l|551
[BK][BK]that there is difficulty even in death.|d1y5d8l|552
so no difficulty should surpass that of death.|d1y5d8l|553
[BK][BK]i lived by that, i make my problems less complicated, at least less complicated then suicide.|d1y5d8l|554

[BK]___[BK][BK]I have been secretly depressed and have deep anxiety.|d1y8fqu|561
I take seroquel and zoloft daily.|d1y8fqu|562
I fake enthusiasm so well that no one around me realizes that I am actually kind of dead inside.|d1y8fqu|563
I put up a good smiling face for my family and friends and then crash and burn when I am alone, anxiety so strong it feels like I would die any second.|d1y8fqu|564
My first attempt, I used my old belt around my neck and tied it around my neck.|d1y8fqu|565
I tied the other end on my bed frame and I tightened and pulled hard till my vision was blacking out.|d1y8fqu|566
The metal buckle broke and I lived.|d1y8fqu|567
I felt nothing.|d1y8fqu|568
No joy, no regret, no happiness.|d1y8fqu|569
It was life as usual.|d1y8fqu|570
I do not think I will try again, I just get tired of smiling for everyone else while I am breaking down inside.|d1y8fqu|571
It''s hard.|d1y8fqu|572

Fucking car ran out of gas.|d1y4hbs|580
Fuck me I stll exist.|d1y4hbs|581
Seriously, that happened.|d1y4hbs|582
Throw away because my family knows my reddit and they think I am doing well.|d1y15l5|583
The first real thought was confusion.|d1y15l5|584
Confusion in where the plan had gone wrong, and confusion is where I was now.|d1y15l5|585
I jumped off the tallest bridge around, honestly there was no reason why I should still be alive.|d1y15l5|586
It was the world's cruel long con against me and gravity was it is method of torture.|d1y15l5|587
After the first thought, the second was anger.|d1y15l5|588
Angry because the entire point was to end my family's suffering because of me, and here I was in an obviously expensive hospital room.|d1y15l5|589
[BK][BK]The next thought was actually quite peaceful.|d1y15l5|590
Yes, there were new problems, quite immediate problems to deal with, somehow the older ones had gone to the back of my mind.|d1y15l5|591
Things felt calm, and for a few brief moments, I could listen to the silence and not hear it laughing at me.|d1y15l5|592
[BK][BK]Trying to kill yourself is not fun.|d1y15l5|593
It is not a first option either, not a second, third fourth or fifth.|d1y15l5|594
It's the last option.|d1y15l5|595
It's like being trapped on the top floor of a building that is burning slowly beneath you.|d1y15l5|596
You try to deal with i, try as long as you can.|d1y15l5|597
Then it starts consuming you and clouds up everything else you are doing, and sooner or later all you can do is think about the fire, see the fire, feel the fire.|d1y15l5|598
Any other plan you might have had soon disappears, and the only option in front of you is your very last option: jump.|d1y15l5|599
It's not because you think you will survive the fall, it is because you accept death and understand that jumping is the easier way to go.|d1y15l5|600
Either stay and suffocate, or jump and feel a few brief moments of peace.|d1y15l5|601
[BK][BK]It was the highest fucking bridge around and it was not high enough.|d1y15l5|602
Maybe next time I will just try and find a gun.|d1y15l5|603
The first time I attempted suicide, I hung a belt from a hook on the ceiling, put it around my neck, jumped off a chair, and tore a huge chunk out of the ceiling of my room as I crashed to the floor in a pile.|d1y6aqp|604
"I think my first thought (after 'owwwww'"") was '""How am I going to explain this hole in the ceiling to my mother?"|d1y6aqp|605
"'""[BK][BK]Second time, it was '""Crap, how am I going to explain these slashes on my wrists to my mother."|d1y6aqp|606

"'""[BK][BK]Fourth time, I was in the Navy and ate 4000 mg of dextromethorphan powder with a pocket knife on hand to cut myself if that did not work."|d1y6aqp|609
Never got a chance to use it as I got so messed up from the dextromethorphan that apparently I spent two days in the hospital constantly trying to strip off all my clothes in front of everyone.|d1y6aqp|610
"After I came to, it was like '""Shit, I am in the hospital..."|d1y6aqp|611
This is boring.|d1y6aqp|612
When can I go home?|d1y6aqp|613
"'""[BK][BK]Fifth time, it was '""Crap, my commanding officer saw the slashes on my wrists; I hope I do not get kicked out of the Navy.'"""|d1y6aqp|614

I thought I would died, thought what I was experiencing was death.|d1ym1c4|620
[BK][BK]I found my friends, my real family, and broke down in front of them, crying and screaming in silence that I was sorry for leaving them and that I would do anything to undo my actions.|d1ym1c4|621
[BK][BK]They turned to me one by one, they could hear me, it must be a miracle I thought, and it was, I was alive.|d1ym1c4|622
[BK][BK]I told them what happened and they just held me, not letting go, I could feel them shaking and the tears from everyone.|d1ym1c4|623
[BK][BK]For anyone considering suicide, there are people who love you, and when you are gone it will destroy them, and you cannot undo that|d1ym1c4|624
throwaway because this is my biggest secret and is not something I am proud of.|d1yaiip|625
[BK][BK]Was 15.|d1yaiip|626
Retrospectively I lived a wonderful life, but decided to choose a permanent solution to temporary problems.|d1yaiip|627
Got my older brothers gun (Merica), went to the garage.|d1yaiip|628
Loaded it.|d1yaiip|629
[BK][BK]I swear my thoughts were ripped straight from the lyrics of a shitty 2000's pop-rock album.|d1yaiip|630
I imagined how bad it would make that whore feel, how all my friends would come to my funeral, how my parents who were going through a divorce would cry, how my brother would probably hear the gunshot upstairs and be the one who finds me, how my band would write a song in my honor – what an awesome show.|d1yaiip|631
Lot's of cool people ended this way – Kurt Cobain, Hemingway.|d1yaiip|632
You will miss me, I will be a legend.|d1yaiip|633
[BK][BK]I pulled the trigger with the gun to my temple.|d1yaiip|634
It felt like a hammer had hit my head, my eardrum exploded and I remember time decreasing in viscosity as I slipped out of consciousness.|d1yaiip|635
I felt warm.|d1yaiip|636
[BK][BK]I opened my eyes to a burning sensation going straight through my head.|d1yaiip|637
My eyes were on fire, I was coughing, I could not breathe.|d1yaiip|638
I could not see.|d1yaiip|639
I could not hear.|d1yaiip|640
Tears were rolling down my face.|d1yaiip|641
Blood was gushing down the side of my head.|d1yaiip|642
I did not understand what was going on.|d1yaiip|643
I did not think shooting off my head was this painful.|d1yaiip|644
[BK][BK]Then I stood up, dizzy as hell.|d1yaiip|645
I bolted outside from the gas filled garage and let the sun hit my face.|d1yaiip|646
I could not open my eyes, nor could I hear anything.|d1yaiip|647
The neighbors saw me and called the cops with an ambulance.|d1yaiip|648
[BK][BK]Turned out my brother only had tear gas bullets.|d1yaiip|649
I managed to make an excuse that it was an accident, that I was playing with the gun in the garage and shot myself by mistake.|d1yaiip|650
I had squeezed the trigger too hard, jerking the gun upwards so the burn-mark on my head was not at a direct angle.|d1yaiip|651
Everyone believed me.|d1yaiip|652
I got insane amounts of attention in the hospital from my family and all my friends.|d1yaiip|653

"[BK][BK]While I was choking on the rope, I heard a voice saying '""Don''t do it."|d1y56po|786
You got something great coming.|d1y56po|787
"Just stick around'""."|d1y56po|788
The voice was very calming.|d1y56po|789
My brother crying out for me helped too.|d1y56po|790
[BK][BK]Though I did not kill myself, I went through a HARSH 15 year addiction to porn afterwards.|d1y56po|791
Porn was a great stress reliever.|d1y56po|792
What started as a means to get over the crap I went through became mandatory.|d1y56po|793
Over the years, I lost relationships with great people due to my addiction.|d1y56po|794
[BK][BK]By the grace of God, I got over my addiction coming up seven months ago and my life is back on track.|d1y56po|795
[BK][BK]People say that black people do not commit (or attempt to commit) suicide are wrong.|d1y56po|796
Lee Thompson Young did.|d1y56po|797
Don Cornelius did.|d1y56po|798
Ken Griffey, Jr. almost offed himself.|d1y56po|799
"[BK][BK]All I wanted that time was for someone to listen to me."""|d1y56po|800
I was only 14 when I really tried to kill myself.|d1y7s4p|801
I would always chickened out last minuite every other time.|d1y7s4p|802
So this time I did something I could not back out of.|d1y7s4p|803
I mixed some pills with a bottle of alcohol, all stolen from around the house.|d1y7s4p|804
I knew my parents would be back late and I was home alone.|d1y7s4p|805
I told the one person who I hoped still cared about me goodbye, then I lay down.|d1y7s4p|806
[BK][BK]My dad came home from work early.|d1y7s4p|807
I had not passed out, I was groggy and sluring my speech and he kept asking me what I would done.|d1y7s4p|808
I think I had acess to something sharp too and he was scared I would hurt myself further but somehow I do not exactly remember he got me to the hospital and I spent all night throwing up and blacking out and in the morning I was still there.|d1y7s4p|809
[BK][BK]And I thought, I would have died if it were not for my dad.|d1y7s4p|810
The person I told did not do anything to try to stop me.|d1y7s4p|811
I thought I needed to sort out my priorities and to see who actually did care and cut out those who did not.|d1y7s4p|812
[BK][BK]I never tried again.|d1y7s4p|813
Mainly because I did not want to mess it up, I was told that what I had taken would be more likely to seriously innure me and give me a life long disability than outright kill me.|d1y7s4p|814
I do not know if that is true but it svared me far more than death ever could.|d1y7s4p|815
I spent a long time depressed and suicidal but eventually I got better.|d1y7s4p|816
When I was teenager and have very deep depression I somehow managed to find my father''s revolver and several bullets.|d1y9vzf|817
I loaded three of them so the chances will be 50/50 and actually did the thing.|d1y9vzf|818
I was so nervous that when I heard quiet click noise I thought that was the end.|d1y9vzf|819
"After couple minutes of shock I finally realized nothing happened, and first thing came to mind was 'OK, so if fate do not want me to die I will try to manage myself'""."|d1y9vzf|820
"Can''t say my life was not shit after that, but it was definitely better."""|d1y9vzf|821
Shiiiiiiit the one time I could actually add something to the tread and it is a little late .|d1y57jh|822
But I am still gonna type it cause it is 1 a.m. and I cannot sleep well I have tried to kill myself about 4 Times, first time was in high school I took a razor blade to my neck , luckily a nearby student saw it and told an officer (I was outside behind the school) at the emergency room the doctor on call told me if I went just went a little deeper I could have hit a artery and I would have died .|d1y57jh|823
After I was stitched up and question by the hospital psychologist I was admitted to the mental care wing of the hospital  .|d1y57jh|824
After a week I left and for some reason I never really thought of it I never realized how big of a deal it was I guess I still  do not.|d1y57jh|825
"I did not really think it was  crazy or an insane thing to do it, to me it was the same As spilling milk it was something people should not cry over, I did not think ' boy I am glad I did not die '"" I just did not care ."|d1y57jh|826
"The next couple of times I just kinda shrug my shoulders and thought '""oops that is my bad, that is my blunder'""."|d1y57jh|827
"I do not know what that says about me but suicide was never an unspeakable or unforgivable act it just is """|d1y57jh|828
When I was 20 I was going through a rough spot and I was in a really bad relationship that lasted 6 years.|d1ygupb|829
She cheated on me all the time, was verbally abusive and an all around horrible person.|d1ygupb|830
One night (Around 2am) I could not take it anymore and I decided to take my car down a local street where many others have lost control and died.|d1ygupb|831
There are some serious bumps and hills where every tree has flowers/memorials on it.|d1ygupb|832
[BK]  [BK]I was doing about 95mph when I hit the bumps and lost it...  [BK]  [BK][BK]My car spun out of control and it felt like time completely stopped then went in to fast forward.|d1ygupb|833
[BK]When my car had finally came to a halt I was in the center of the road.|d1ygupb|834
Untouched.|d1ygupb|835
[BK]  [BK][BK]At that moment I felt a purpose.|d1ygupb|836
I was not supposed to die.|d1ygupb|837
[BK]There was something more waiting for me.|d1ygupb|838
[BK]I did not know what the reason was but there was this deep sense of life.|d1ygupb|839
[BK][BK]After sitting there in silence for about 10 minutes, I turned around, went back home and cried myself to sleep.|d1ygupb|840
[BK]The next morning I drove down that same road.|d1ygupb|841
[BK]I remember exactly where I started to lose control because there is an old gate to an abandoned barn right where the first bump is.|d1ygupb|842
[BK]I saw the tire tracks...|d1ygupb|843
They went straight in to the woods...  [BK]And the tracks came back out about 10-20 feet down the road and continued to spin until I stopped.|d1ygupb|844
[BK]I was never one to believe in miracles or guardian angels but God had my back that day.|d1ygupb|845
[BK]I finally broke it off with my long term girlfriend that weekend.|d1ygupb|846
[BK]I met the most amazing girl not long after and we are married now.|d1ygupb|847
[BK]I have graduated college and I am living a pretty awesome life.|d1ygupb|848
[BK]Total 180 from where I was at a few years back.|d1ygupb|849
[BK][BK]The moral of the story is just let time & God do his thing.|d1ygupb|850
[BK]There is purpose in everyone, even if you do not feel it.|d1ygupb|851
[BK]You have worth and meaning to someone, somewhere.|d1ygupb|852
[BK]Don't give up.|d1ygupb|853
Don't lose hope.|d1ygupb|854
You are loved.|d1ygupb|855
Probably will get buried, but I think in some ways I need to share this for me.|d1ygupg|856
[BK][BK]I have attempted twice.|d1ygupg|857
The first time I do not even know if I was intending to die...I just knew I did not want to wake up, if that makes sense.|d1ygupg|858
I was just so so tired, endlessly tired, so I swallowed a bottle of pills to finally get some peace and quiet.|d1ygupg|859
"My first thought upon waking up was 'Damn, I want to go back to sleep'"", followed by '""Shit, let me hide this."|d1ygupg|860
"'""[BK][BK]I am miles away from the person I was then, thank god."|d1ygupg|861
I am generally pretty happy and have lead an exciting life so far (I am only 21), but still I  acknowledge I will have to continue to fight off depression and anxiety the rest of my life.|d1ygupg|862
If I do not think positively or just use ''mindfulness'', I can easily see my thoughts start to dip.|d1ygupg|863
And you know what, fighting a naturally negative mind is exhausting sometimes.|d1ygupg|864
"Today it sure is, I feel pretty lonely today, but writing about this helps me acknowledge why I feel the way I do I guess."""|d1ygupg|865
I have never posted on Reddit before, but I think it could be helpful to someone, so I think it might be useful.|d20e87o|866
Another thing I should mention is I have attempted on numerous occasions, so I can give a few thoughts after several of my attempts.|d20e87o|867
[BK][BK]I was bullied quite badly, when I started comprehensive school, and it was when I would just started there too, and the teachers did not really do much about it, and my family picked on me quite a bit too, so with everything piling up, I started attempting, at first I would get my dressing gown, and tie the belt around my neck, a part of me knew this would not kill me, without me hanging, but I believe on a subconscious level, I wanted to find out if I would be able to hang myself.|d20e87o|868
[BK][BK]Another attempt was to drown myself, in the bath, I submerged myself, and after a few tries of this I got very close, but at the last minute, my body just brought itself out of the water, and I started breathing, and the closer I got, the more unpleasant it felt, so I stopped, I did not really have a thought, after this, I just got out and carried on as normal, but I did find it too unpleasant to try again.|d20e87o|869
[BK][BK]On another attempt (this was my first year of college, I had taken 2 weeks off, due to feeling badly depressed, and when I had started college I started getting suicidal thoughts as well, which I would never had before and some other issues got worse as well.)|d20e87o|870
After the 2 weeks off, I was feeling really low, a bit worthless and insecure too, and in a way, I felt inferior, so one morning before college, I put a can of aerosol up my nose, thought for a couple of minutes, but I decided to do it, so I sprayed, but with the way it was directed, it was more directed at my nose, rather than up it, so it failed, I was still a bit down and guilty (something which I usually feel, after an attempt) but I just went to college as I should have.|d20e87o|871
[BK][BK]I am better now, I do get bad every now and then, and I do sometimes, wonder what would everything be like if I were successful, or if I was not here, but I found hope, it was not easy, but I started to look after myself, not in a vain way, but at those times, I did not really love myself, so I started to do that, and it does help, I took it one step at a time, but I eventually got through it.|d20e87o|872
Also, if anyone here ever needs a chat or something, then you can feel free to PM me, I know this sounds cliché, but I am a good listener, and I care, so I will do my best to help, if I can.|d20e87o|873
I am not a counsellor or doctor or anything like that, but if anyone needs help, I will do my best to help.|d20e87o|874
On 12/12/12 (easiest day to remember) I overdosed on 40 Tylenol with codeine.|d1ybzow|875
I had a really bad eating disorder in highschool, so bad that I ended up getting an ulcer (excessive stomach acid from bulimia) and got a prescription for the Tylenol.|d1ybzow|876
I was being reckless at school and smoked some pot and got in trouble so my dad had to pick me up.|d1ybzow|877
decided I could not fuck up anymore than I had so I went home and took all the pills I had left in the bottle.|d1ybzow|878
As an aside, I would been cutting and burning my arms for a while and had been in and out of different psych hospitals for a few years so my dad figured I would do something reckless after the suspension.|d1ybzow|879
He noticed I was twitching and looked not like myself and immediately knew I had done something stupid.|d1ybzow|880
Either way one thing led to another and I was at the hospital fighting a nurse who tried to give me Pepcid (medicine to counteract the OD) and I remember screaming and telling them to just let me die, things were all a bit fuzzy from this day.|d1ybzow|881
Then it got worse because as it turns out I am deathly allergic to Pepcid and I went into anaphylactic shock right infront of my parents after they would just watched me scream about wanting to die.|d1ybzow|882
So this was a shitshow.|d1ybzow|883
Just a mess where 16 year old me is ruining everything.|d1ybzow|884
I faded out of consciousness and woke up with a headache but saw my parents at the end of the bed.|d1ybzow|885
My first thought was 'fuck.|d1ybzow|886
"I cannot even kill myself.'"""|d1ybzow|887
So of course I was put into intensive care and four years later I am doing really well at college and do not deal with the same issues anymore.|d1ybzow|888
I think what changed things was seeing how distraught my parents were at the end of the bed watching me hopelessly.|d1ybzow|889
I am really good at a lot of stuff I do, I can run 10 miles and I have a 4.0 and in general am doing really well, but I cannot fucking kill myself.|d1ybzow|890
"Today, I am pretty glad I am bad at suicide and I am even more thankful that I was given parents who never ever even thought of giving up on me. """|d1ybzow|891
'The baby too?|d1y4z5c|892

Found unconscious by my SO.|d1y4z5c|897
But I guess more than my actually thinking was the feeling of shame.|d1y4z5c|898
I knew I let him down.|d1y4z5c|899
And As much as I would like to say I wouldnt do it again.|d1y4z5c|900
I think about it every day.|d1y4z5c|901
"Just waiting for the most convenient time in my loved ones lives honestly."""|d1y4z5c|902
Waking up the next day completely fine, wondering how I could have failed myself again.|d1y1p51|903
Ended up trying again the following week with the same results, and just kind of gave up and accepted the fact that I am a failure.|d1y1p51|904
[BK][BK]Although for the record, I am doing a lot better now.|d1y1p51|905
Six five hundred mg Vicodin and a bottle of rum did not do the trick.|d1y41on|906
But it put me out for an entire day.|d1y41on|907
I woke up still depressed but with an odd sense of hope.|d1y41on|908
Difficult to describe.|d1y41on|909
"'Thank you, Jesus'""[BK][BK]I blame a guardian angel for being the only thing getting me down."|d1y2qrp|910
The way I was hung was correct.|d1y2qrp|911
Something undid my rope nice and slowly, in mid air as if it was mimicking the movements a human would make holding it, then I felt something lift me and gently place me on the ground.|d1y2qrp|912
Been a stern believer in my fate from 90% to 200% from what I saw as I hung there blacking it.|d1y2qrp|913
I luckily never succeeded.|d1y2qrp|914
Started the process of a new life afterwards.|d1y2qrp|915

I could understand people, but there was this sort of a delay in my reaction time.|d1y86b2|933
The worst part is I was so messed up I was hallucinating that my skin was covered in small spiders, and so was the floor.|d1y86b2|934
I stayed curled up in the corner of my bed for another full 24 hours until the hallucinations stopped.|d1y86b2|935

[BK][BK]My then-partner found me sobbing in my underwear in the kitchen that night, halfway through making the first cut.|d23l3we|968
It took two people (the flatmate helped) to pull clothes on me, then drag me to the local Emergency Department.|d23l3we|969
"[BK][BK]My first thought on being tackled in the kitchen was a bitter, '""Great, so I am even a failure at this as well.'"""|d23l3we|970
That echoed through the next five hours being watched by the beady eyes of three no-nonsense orderlies, who did not hesitate in almost literally sitting on me when I was caught trying again while the nurses'' backs were turned.|d23l3we|971

I was then confronted with loads of Good Samaritans who wanted to help, among them a nurse who knew what she was doing.|d1ydji6|977

At least a year later I got to be with a lovely lady for two years who I still keep in touch with.|d1y4xhi|1025
She really saved me and would stay up all night with us when we felt that way again.|d1y4xhi|1026
When I was starting high school I decided to move to Florida with my mom.|d1yu9kr|1027
My parents had divorced and my mom packed up and left one day.|d1yu9kr|1028
I went from living her to living with my dad suddenly.|d1yu9kr|1029
My dad was incredibly poor and mean to me (looking back it was because of the stress of raising five kids with no money, we wasnt mean he was depressed).|d1yu9kr|1030
Anyway I moved to Florida and everyone was cruel to me.|d1yu9kr|1031
I had no friends, no one was even nice to me.|d1yu9kr|1032
I was alone all the time and incredibly depressed.|d1yu9kr|1033
No one in Indiana wanted me and neither did anyone in Florida.|d1yu9kr|1034
[BK][BK]So one night I went out and threw myself off of The Pier in Saint Petersburg (its a large shopping building that is on a Pier that extends into Tampa Bay).|d1yu9kr|1035
I just sort of climbed the railing and jumped in during high waves because of a storm.|d1yu9kr|1036
I figured no one would find me because it was late at night.|d1yu9kr|1037
[BK][BK]When I came to there were a group of four or five homeless guys that were trying to help me.|d1yu9kr|1038
I had worn a bunch of heavy clothing to weigh me down.|d1yu9kr|1039
They had stripped me down to my essentials (shirt and shorts).|d1yu9kr|1040
One was sprinting down the beach leading the EMTs to me.|d1yu9kr|1041
[BK][BK]When I actually was able to make thoughts again I remember just thinking about how people that had nothing in life worked so hard to save my life.|d1yu9kr|1042
I vowed to never let my struggle with the feeling of having nothing ever get the better of me again.|d1yu9kr|1043
I moved back to Indiana and started donating and working with the homeless.|d1yu9kr|1044
I vowed to dedicate my life to those less fortunate than myself, because I owe them my life.|d1yu9kr|1045
[BK][BK]I never did meet the five guys that saved me again.|d1yu9kr|1046
[BK][BK]TL:DR Tried to drown myself, was saved by group of homeless men, vowed to dedicate life to helping others.|d1yu9kr|1047
Shame.|d1y3e37|1048
That I had gotten myself into such a dark place I was willing to put my close loved ones back into the same position we had all just experienced with the loss of my grandfather to suicide just a few months prior.|d1y3e37|1049
Shame.|d1y3e37|1050
That I was willing to hurt myself and potentially my future daughter as the result my failed attempt.|d1y3e37|1051
Even almost three years later, I still think about dying almost every day.|d1y3e37|1052
It's a struggle and it is very hard when you want something so badly though you know it is wrong and you should not allow yourself to have it.|d1y3e37|1053
I guess as difficult as it is I am lucky to have her to remind me to not give in.|d1y3e37|1054
Who else is going to be dependable enough to care for her the way I do?|d1y3e37|1055
It was fragments of things.|d1y3hzr|1056
All I remember from the first part after it is wanting things to go back to the way they used to be before all the bullshit in my life started, wishing it had worked, and just wanting to sleep for a very long time until everything was okay.|d1y3hzr|1057
[BK]I was 18 and in an a relationship that that was abusive in every way possible except physically.|d1y3hzr|1058
I have no doubts that it would have turned physical if I had not left.|d1y3hzr|1059
And I only left after he raped me.|d1y3hzr|1060
That was over 5 years ago.|d1y3hzr|1061
Things have gotten better but you do not forget or leave behind something like that.|d1y3hzr|1062
Most days are fine but there are some I just cannot handle certain things.|d1y3hzr|1063
Nights are the worst.|d1y3hzr|1064
I have had multiple exes tell me I have nightmares far more often than I remember.|d1y3hzr|1065
My dog helps me out with that now though, she is learned to wake me up if I am having a really bad one.|d1y3hzr|1066
"I asked the police officer, 'do I have to pay the trespassing charge?'""."|d1y5utf|1067
He laughed and said not to worry about it.|d1y5utf|1068
"Turns out I did not. """|d1y5utf|1069
*God damn, okay tell them it was a mistake.|d1y599t|1070
*[BK][BK]'I got confused about my meds, it was just a mistake.|d1y599t|1071
"'""[BK][BK]They believed me the first couple of times."|d1y599t|1072
They did not believe the hanging was accidental though.|d1y599t|1073
[BK][BK]Oddly, the one time I overdosed on accident, it was assumed to be a suicide attempt.|d1y599t|1074
"I was given codeine cough syrup and between the pharmacist mixing it at double strength and me reading '""4 tsp a day'"" as '""4 tbsp a dose'"" I ODed big time."|d1y599t|1075
I had pneumonia on top of it so ended up waking up three days later in a hospital.|d1y599t|1076
[BK][BK]On the other hand, I felt GREAT when I woke up.|d1y599t|1077
My cough was so much better after getting some sleep (I had not slept more than fifteen minutes or so for the last few weeks) and while I was out they used some kind of breathing treatment on me that cleared up at least half the yuck out of me.|d1y599t|1078
[BK][BK]Thankfully my doctor asked for the remaining syrup to be tested and found it was mixed to the highest strength, not the lower strength the doctor ordered for me.|d1y599t|1079
Doc figured if it had been an actual suicide I,would have swallowed the whole bottle, not just the mega dose I thought was a normal dose.|d1y599t|1080
"(He was right)"""|d1y599t|1081
I got consumed by an immense fear.|d1y5lzg|1082
The moment I realized what I had tried to do, it dawned on me.|d1y5lzg|1083
[BK]My pain would stop, but so would everything else.|d1y5lzg|1084
[BK][BK]I would miss so many things if I had ended it on that day.|d1y5lzg|1085
I would not ever again walk in a calm summer evening, a slight chill breeze in the air.|d1y5lzg|1086
I would not ever sit on a balcony and watch the light clouds roll through the skies at night.|d1y5lzg|1087
I would not ever know true love, the feeling of being held by someone, early in the morning, just listening to each other breathe.|d1y5lzg|1088
I would not ever be able to see my friends and share our laughter, our tears, our aspirations, our late night talks, ever again.|d1y5lzg|1089
I would miss so many amazing stories being told.|d1y5lzg|1090
I would miss seeing so many places.|d1y5lzg|1091
Experiences.|d1y5lzg|1092
[BK][BK]So I just broke down and cried for a solid couple of hours.|d1y5lzg|1093
I carried on the next day.|d1y5lzg|1094
[BK][BK]I still experience depression.|d1y5lzg|1095
But I have never felt low enough again to get to that place.|d1y5lzg|1096
Because no matter how low I feel, I make myself remember: there is so much more beauty in the world.|d1y5lzg|1097
We are what we choose to be and what we do.|d1y5lzg|1098
We can form the experiences we want.|d1y5lzg|1099
[BK][BK]I have had so many wonderful things happen to me since then and I hope everyone who feels this way realizes there is so much they can contribute, that they can do whatever they want.|d1y5lzg|1100
There is so much beauty out there.|d1y5lzg|1101
I promise, there is so much out there waiting for you.|d1y5lzg|1102
It eventually gets better.|d1y5lzg|1103
It's not an easy road.|d1y5lzg|1104
But it is so much better to take that road than not at all.|d1y5lzg|1105
There's a reason I am still here, and it is not my time yet.|d1ygyix|1106
To this day I help others who struggle with depression and self destructive tendencies.|d1ygyix|1107
I swore to myself that day, as long as I am still alive, no one would ever feel as lonely as I once did.|d1ygyix|1108
I was very delirious when I woke up.|d1y603q|1109
I was in the ICU connected to a few IV''s, a heart monitor, and a catheter (and probably other things, but I do not remember much).|d1y603q|1110
I remember my sisters concerned face above me, and I remember the room''s TV in the corner.|d1y603q|1111
I was not aware that I was in the hospital, or that I would tried to kill myself.|d1y603q|1112
All that I could think of was the stupid television.|d1y603q|1113
[BK][BK]See, I had a television about the same size.|d1y603q|1114
A 50' Samsung.|d1y603q|1115
But this TV was a Sharp.|d1y603q|1116
I could not figure out why someone would break into my place, steal my Samsung TV, and replace it with a slightly shittier TV.|d1y603q|1117
I spent 2 days trying to figure it out.|d1y603q|1118
"[BK][BK]Anyways, apparently I did nothing but say '""I am sorry'"" for 3 days, so I guess I was sorry that I tried to kill myself."""|d1y603q|1119
I tried to hang myself.|d1y6faq|1120
On a very desparate day, i watched a video on how to make noose and that night i set it up to just stop me about 1m (?)|d1y6faq|1121
above the floor.|d1y6faq|1122
I pushed away all other furniture just so i wont be able to reach them and survive, steped on the back of a chair put the noose on and kicked the chair.|d1y6faq|1123
[BK]I immediatly felt some sort of blackness (did i pass out?|d1y6faq|1124
), severe pain around my neck and above all, i felt my feet touching the ground!|d1y6faq|1125
Turns out climbing rope can strech out like a motherfucker.|d1y6faq|1126
It was the only rope at the house and i didnt even think that this might happen.|d1y6faq|1127
"[BK]I came to, and for a blink of an eye i thought 'fuck yes i am alive!'"""|d1y6faq|1128
I looked around and reached for the desk by extending my leg, fortunatly i did reach it and pulled it towards me.|d1y6faq|1129
There were scissors on it.|d1y6faq|1130
I cut the rope and went straight to a mirror, i had a huge round burnmark around my neck, (went away after a year) and some hair pulled out.|d1y6faq|1131
[BK]I remember how fucking scared i was and how fucking relieved i was to be alive!|d1y6faq|1132
[BK][BK]That was about 3 years ago and i m still glad i didnt die.|d1y6faq|1133
On very intense awful moments i will fantasize that i have to-will do it, but i KNOW that i will not.|d1y6faq|1134
[BK][BK]Please nobody do this.|d1y6faq|1135
"Life is everything."""|d1y6faq|1136
I was bullied when I was younger mostly, because my looks, but also for my behaviour.|d29e7w5|1137
The reason behind my behaviour was the fact that I have ADHD, which nobody knew at the time.|d29e7w5|1138
so to the main point, i´ve tried to kill myself several times but have failed everytime and every time I fail my reaction has been both happy and sad.|d29e7w5|1139
Happy because my family wouldn´t get the new that I killed myself, but sad because I was still here and that I knew that I would still get bullied...|d29e7w5|1140
When I was in something in between 1:st and 5:th grade i tried to strangle myself with a jumprope and later on I tried to do the same thing but with a regular belt.. Been depressed and suicidal for years, but now im just depressed.|d29e7w5|1141
[BK]But If i wouldn´t be here today I wouldn´t have had the chance to go to Dreamhack Masters Malmö (CSGO event) and interview two of my idols and rolemodels, whereas one has been my rolemodel since I started watching CSGO, and he´s like a mentor to me so... yeaah.|d29e7w5|1142
hope this answers your question a bit..|d29e7w5|1143
Needed to get out some feelings aswell, hope that´s okay xD|d29e7w5|1144
"'god dammit'"""""|d1y7ida|1145
I felt more alone than I ever had before.|d1y812c|1146
The few people in my life that I thought may care I was gone were now angry with me and distant.|d1y812c|1147
No one wanted to associate or talk with me.|d1y812c|1148
I was now in physical pain, not just the emotional pain I had been in, and wanted some positive attention but all I received was anger.|d1y812c|1149
I was in the hospital, and even the doctors were upset.|d1y812c|1150
[BK][BK]I had not expected that.|d1y812c|1151
I thought I would either succeed, or at least if I failed receive an outpouring of grief and understanding of the real struggles I faced.|d1y812c|1152
It turned out so completely different than I imagined.|d1y812c|1153
In the end, I hurt the only people who I cared about, and pushed them out of my life.|d1y812c|1154
That was several decades ago, and I have only reconciled with my mother -- I was never able to repair the relationships with anyone else.|d1y812c|1155
[BK][BK]My second thoughts were how to move forward.|d1y812c|1156
When you plan suicide, you do not spend much if any time thinking about the aftermath if you fail.|d1y812c|1157
Lying in a hospital bed you spend a LOT of time thinking about what comes next.|d1y812c|1158
It took a lot of therapy and life changes to move forward.|d1y812c|1159
Way too late for any visibility, but I will share it anyway.|d1ygzd0|1160
[BK][BK]When I was in the fifth grade I had a lot of shit going on (bullying mainly), so one day I just said fuck everything and got a .357 out of the cabinet and put it to my head.|d1ygzd0|1161
[BK][BK]Against all odds the piece of shit jammed.|d1ygzd0|1162
"So after I realized what happened I just thought 'is it really that bad?'"""|d1ygzd0|1163
Then I took a shower and wiped all the shit off.|d1ygzd0|1164
[BK][BK]It''s funny because I take that for granted a lot, but that gun should not have jammed.|d1ygzd0|1165
It was using .38 special rounds which is why, but it still is not very common.|d1ygzd0|1166
"[BK][BK]Nowadays I am never depressed and I am pretty much the opposite of who I was 5 years ago."""|d1ygzd0|1167
I have never personally attempted suicide but I have been through and still go through my own bouts of depression and my best friend has struggled with it a lot more and has attempted to kill himself twice now.|d1y8uyp|1168
For those wondering, he is doing much better now and I am doing alright.|d1y8uyp|1169
Every day has it is own challenges, big or small, but I always try to remind myself of the quote, 'This too shall pass.|d1y8uyp|1170
"'""[BK][BK]I cannot quite remember the details of the story/origin behind it at the moment and do not feel like looking it up but it is something along the lines of a king was bored with his life so he told someone to make or write him something he could look at or read that would make him sad when he was happy, and also make him happy when he was sad."|d1y8uyp|1171
After puzzling over it for some time they finally came back with a ring for him that was inscribed with that quote.|d1y8uyp|1172
[BK][BK]It has always been comforting to me, because it has always proven itself to be true in my own experience.|d1y8uyp|1173
It may help some, it may not, I just wanted to share it either way.|d1y8uyp|1174
[BK][BK]Edit: I know I probably should not share or say what I am about to say because some may find it in poor taste but fuck it, I am going to anyway because I am laughing and I want to try to help others laugh as well.|d1y8uyp|1175
Even if it is only one other weirdo like me out there somewhere in the void, it will be worth it to me at least..[BK]My Dad has gifted me a dark sense of humor and he recently passed away which has been really hard for me.|d1y8uyp|1176
"But reading through this thread, seeing all these quotes from people who had just tried to kill themselves and the inevitable '""it can only go up from here'"" comments, I cannot help but think of what my dad might have said and just smile."|d1y8uyp|1177
"Like, '""Sure, life may go up again, but that''ll just give me a higher place to jump from.'"""|d1y8uyp|1178
I realize some, probably most, do not find that funny.|d1y8uyp|1179
"But I do, because it reminds me of my dad and I really miss him."""|d1y8uyp|1180
I had accepted I was alive just from where I had gone.|d1y5bdh|1181
[BK]Apparently I did die and had to be brought back.|d1y5bdh|1182
[BK]And I remember exactly why and how I came back.|d1y5bdh|1183
[BK]I realized I was too scared of how people would be hurt and I forced myself back into myself.|d1y5bdh|1184
[BK]So when I woke up I just thought 'This sucks but it is the right thing.|d1y5bdh|1185
"'""[BK]I did not realize I had actually succeeded in killing myself until I was in the psycheward and was let know."|d1y5bdh|1186
[BK]Now I sometimes wonder what would have happened had I not decided to come back.|d1y5bdh|1187
"[BK][BK]But then I remember everything that is happened since then and come back to the first thought '""This sucks, but it is right."|d1y5bdh|1188
"'""[BK][BK]I was only 14 at the time, I am 23 now and I know I would have lost just as much as everybody else had I passed."""|d1y5bdh|1189
I attempted suicide once when I was 17.|d1y9sc9|1190
[BK][BK]My mom and sister came home and caught me just as I was doing it.|d1y9sc9|1191
[BK][BK]My first thought and feeling?|d1y9sc9|1192
Instant regret.|d1y9sc9|1193
[BK][BK]I do not mean the regret you feel when you pass up on an outing with friends, or do not ask out your crush.|d1y9sc9|1194
This was a regret which was crippling.|d1y9sc9|1195
The look in my mom''s eyes that night is something I will never ever forget.|d1y9sc9|1196
"[BK][BK]Up until that moment, I have heard the whole 'suicide is selfish'"" on TV and from school and blew it off as insignificant."|d1y9sc9|1197
How could a bit of brief sadness from my family be worse than the pain I thought I already put the and myself through?|d1y9sc9|1198
[BK][BK]But her eyes.|d1y9sc9|1199
The look on her face when she knew I was almost gone.|d1y9sc9|1200
It hurt me worse than anything, and I knew I could never ever let her feel that way again.|d1y9sc9|1201
[BK][BK]The first month after that was hard.|d1y9sc9|1202
She worried non stop, but we talked more.|d1y9sc9|1203
In a way.|d1y9sc9|1204
The experience made us closer.|d1y9sc9|1205
[BK][BK]Don''t get me wrong.|d1y9sc9|1206
"If I could go back, I would stop myself before she had the chance to. """|d1y9sc9|1207
"'I just fucked up royally.'"""|d1y4fm9|1208
[BK][BK][BK]I wished I had not done it, not because I wanted to be alive, but because not succeeding meant that I was going to be forced to get help (obviously, I am thankful for that now).|d1y4fm9|1209
I was bitter about it for a long time.|d1y4fm9|1210
[BK][BK][BK]Now, I am meeting with my doctor tomorrow to discuss weaning me off of my SSRIs.|d1y4fm9|1211
"It will be four years to the date of my attempt in another month. """|d1y4fm9|1212
"'I am covered in vomit'"" did not remember vomiting at all but it was everywhere in my bathroom I took two bottles of acetaminophen."|d1yv8oz|1213
All I remember of the night before was taking the pills going to the bathroom and walking around in the dark unaware of where I was I got really mad because I kept banging my face on the walls and stubbing my toes,then all I remember is waking up with vomit all over me and the bathroom.|d1yv8oz|1214
"[BK][BK]On a related note about two years later under the influence of ambien I was in my usually state of mind for being alone which was talking to myself about the need to kill myself and how much I hate myself when I had the realization that [BK]'""If anyone else talked to me the way I talk to myself I would fucking kill them; I have wasted three years of my life like this, either I can kill myself now or try something different.'"""|d1yv8oz|1215

The only saving grace was that I fainted halfway through and did not know what happened afterwards.|d1y6lx0|1227
Apparently, the rope snapped right after I lost consciousness and, well, let me live.|d1y6lx0|1228

[BK][BK]The car I had at the time was shit and shut off because of a bad engine before I could finally succumb to the poisoning.|d1z13w2|1234

Like a drunk confusion.|d1z13w2|1236
Disassociated.|d1z13w2|1237
Eyes swollen as fuck.|d1z13w2|1238
[BK][BK]I drove home to see my best friend and mother in a panic (my best friend was my last call good-bye and my work informed my mother I rage quit my job and was very unsafe).|d1z13w2|1239
For the first time my mom believed how serious I was about my depression and desire to die.|d1z13w2|1240
And it took a while, but I got counseling and help.|d1z13w2|1241
[BK][BK]I wish I could tell you my first thought, but the only thought I can have right now is that I am happy my car was a piece of shit and life gave me another chance.|d1z13w2|1242
[BK][BK]Now I am married, a college grad, and doing really well, counseling those who struggle with depression through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.|d1z13w2|1243

Getting pissed off about it brought me out of the state of mind that night.|d1y4tkm|1245
Turns out my dad had removed the firing pin when he inherited the gun.|d1y4tkm|1246
A couple of years later I overdosed my self with 100 units of my fast acting insulin and a bottle of southern comfort.|d1y4tkm|1247
Woke up in the hospital and was amazed that it did not work.|d1y4tkm|1248
I started smoking figuring that would eventually kill me.|d1y4tkm|1249

"'My mother loves me, what the hell am I doing'""[BK][BK]Id had a huge fight with my mum, and on my newly prescribed medication i just blacked out."|d1y8dd3|1269
The first thing i remember after asking my mum to leave was sitting on my bed with an empty sleepingpill container.|d1y8dd3|1270
I have no recollection of conciously deciding to take all those pills, but i remember lying down, feeling a little drowsy and then rushing into the bathroom to try and make myself throw up when the realisation fully hit me.|d1y8dd3|1271
[BK][BK]My mum took me to the doctors immeditately  (i dont have a gag reflex so i couldnt make myself throw up) and they said the dose i took wasnt lethal, that id just be sleeping for a long time.|d1y8dd3|1272
[BK]Which i did.|d1y8dd3|1273
[BK][BK]The stupid thing is that i tried to kill myself multiple times, but the only time i almost succeeded was the time i didnt even conciously really want to.|d1y8dd3|1274
"[BK][BK][BK]"""|d1y8dd3|1275
I woke up in a hospital.|d1y1inq|1276
At first my mind jumped to: where am I, what is this, what is going on, why cannot i move?|d1y1inq|1277
[BK][BK]Then eventually things become less hazy and you put it together that you are in a hospital hooked up to some machines, and nurses going back and forth periodically checking your vitals.|d1y1inq|1278
Then you start going over in your head, trying to relive what happened in the hours before and how you got here.|d1y1inq|1279
[BK][BK]Did i fall down?|d1y1inq|1280
Did i get in an accident?|d1y1inq|1281
[BK][BK]Eventually you remember getting home belligerently drunk and running into the bathroom and...that bottle of pills...did i down it?|d1y1inq|1282
what was it?|d1y1inq|1283
am i fucked?|d1y1inq|1284
[BK][BK]And this all took place over a course of several hours, maybe half a day, but you keep coming in an out of consciousness and rare moment of lucidity.|d1y1inq|1285
[BK][BK]Eventually you ask where you are, they tell you you are at this hospital.|d1y1inq|1286
you might have a phone nearby, you try to let somebody know because you do not know where anybody is.|d1y1inq|1287
you are just alone, and afraid, and every moment running scenarios on what the worst case scenario is and for the doctor to wear that grim look.|d1y1inq|1288
[BK][BK]eventually you see your family.|d1y1inq|1289
that look in your eyes after your parents drove 8 hrs in the middle of the night after getting the call from your roommate....shit.|d1y1inq|1290
[BK][BK]edit: funny this question comes up.|d1y1inq|1291
anniversary of that night is april 26th, a few weeks from today.|d1y1inq|1292
I celebrate that year the same every year, getting as drunk as i can.|d1y1inq|1293
expect the same out of it this year|d1y1inq|1294
Tried hanging myself with an Ethernet cable from my doorknob.|d1y62cw|1295
It did not work and I woke up to my mom trying to open the door screaming.|d1y62cw|1296
I was pissed it did not work, and my life took an even worse turn after, which made me consider trying it again.|d1y62cw|1297
But by the time I got out of high school, I was over it.|d1y62cw|1298
I stopped caring about everything, and because of false accusations by an ex, I was terrified of women.|d1y62cw|1299
[BK][BK]I remember walking down the stairs at my university and bumping into a woman I would never met And had a debilitating panic attack because I was so afraid of anything coming from it.|d1y62cw|1300
[BK][BK]So I went home with a bunch of prescription pain killers to off myself again, and just before taking them, my dad came in and cried about all of the shit I had to go through, And how much he regrets it all.|d1y62cw|1301
[BK][BK]We talked, and I have never tried since.|d1y62cw|1302
Nothing in life has ever seemed to be a big enough deal to even consider it.|d1y62cw|1303
[BK][BK]Tl;dr, same As everyone, oh shit it did not work.|d1y62cw|1304
I was at point in my life where I did not care.|d1y7sw6|1305
I have 11 unsuccessful suicide attempts already from hanging myself to drinking acid.|d1y7sw6|1306
There is only one attempt that I walked away from that really left me with something to think about after I woke up.|d1y7sw6|1307
I ended up waking up in a hospital bed full of machines and I was not strapped down.|d1y7sw6|1308
I had drank a full months supply of my epilepsy medication.|d1y7sw6|1309
When I woke up I remembered a few things while I was out.|d1y7sw6|1310
The feeling of being completely helpless unable to move, talk or breath.|d1y7sw6|1311
I woke up and my first thought was fuck another failed attempt.|d1y7sw6|1312
I had doctors surrounding my bed all excited I survived but I just wanted to die|d1y7sw6|1313
Not sure if this counts, but I had a somewhat intentional heroin overdose last year.|d1y4z9i|1314
[BK][BK][BK]I was at the bottom of the pit of despair, things could not get any worse, and I had a good amount of heroin on me.|d1y4z9i|1315
I knew as I was drawing up the shot that it was going to be a big one, but it either did not click in my head, or I just did not care it was most likely going to kill me.|d1y4z9i|1316
"[BK][BK][BK]I pulled the needle out of my arm, said 'oh fuck'"" and that was it."|d1y4z9i|1317
I woke up to my friends surrounding me, but I did not fully regain consciousness til about an hour later.|d1y4z9i|1318
"The first thought I remember was '""I am so glad I am back'"" followed by '""I cannot do this anymore."|d1y4z9i|1319
"'""[BK][BK][BK]That was my last shot of heroin (9 months ago) and my life has since been fucking great."|d1y4z9i|1320
I am so grateful for my friends who knew CPR and we are able to bring me back.|d1y4z9i|1321
"I cannot ever imagine leaving my family behind, and the fact I almost did makes me want to slap myself"""|d1y4z9i|1322
Most of it was a very irrational haze, the first conscious thought I remember was to immediately call my girlfriend, and tell her I loved her.|d1y6i10|1323
I explained what happened and she did not say anything , and just cried.|d1y6i10|1324
I was alone at college and I have suffered from PTSD, severe addiction, and Major Depressive Disorder.|d1yd7ly|1325
This was not my first attempt, but the most serious one.|d1yd7ly|1326
I just finally got so exhausted, death just seemed like the next logical step.|d1yd7ly|1327
I had failed at everything in my life and I could not take the shame and guilt of being me anymore.|d1yd7ly|1328
[BK][BK]I took as many pills as I could.|d1yd7ly|1329
I picked up a bunch of pain pills and xanax bars.|d1yd7ly|1330
I took more than I could count.|d1yd7ly|1331
A girl I had known for two weeks came over to see why I did not come to class.|d1yd7ly|1332
She found me blacked out on the floor barely alive.|d1yd7ly|1333
She dragged me to the elevator and managed to get our advisor to drive us across the street to the hospital.|d1yd7ly|1334
I woke up afterwards wondering how and why I was alive.|d1yd7ly|1335
I was so angry that I could not get that final release of all the pain.|d1yd7ly|1336
[BK][BK]She told me that I needed to quit using and try to get better and we could try having a relationship.|d1yd7ly|1337
I had never been in a relationship before so I had no idea she even liked me.|d1yd7ly|1338
I went to treatment for the 6th time and we started dating.|d1yd7ly|1339
[BK][BK]I had never been shown the kindness she gave to me and the unconditional love.|d1yd7ly|1340
It changed who I was and made me realize that I am not the only person who would be affected by my death.|d1yd7ly|1341
She is the most beautiful, loving and caring person I have ever met.|d1yd7ly|1342
[BK][BK]Four years later we are engaged to be married later this year.|d1yd7ly|1343
I am sober and about to finish up my degree.|d1yd7ly|1344
Now when I know a friend or relative is depressed I tell them that they could be right around the corner from something life changing.|d1yd7ly|1345
I cannot say it is been a perfect ride, but my life is better than I could have imagined.|d1yd7ly|1346
There were a few major hiccups along the way, but I am still here.|d1yd7ly|1347
I have tried a couple times, the first time I woke up and vomited for what seemed like a week straight and swore I would never try again.. Several years later I attempted again, I vividly remember how scary those last moments of consciousness where and thinking about how I should have said goodbye and that I would never see my loved ones again.|d1y3j7z|1348
After I woke up, two days later in ICU, I was scared because I did not know where I was, but then I was thankful to have a chance to see my family again.|d1y3j7z|1349
[BK][BK]I swore after that hospital stay, and the hefty bill that came along with it, I would not attempt again.|d1y3j7z|1350
It's been 5 years since then.|d1y3j7z|1351
I would be lying if I said I have not thought about suicide again.|d1y3j7z|1352
But I always remind myself of those moments before I blacked out, also I think of my brother who found me (we have never talked about it because I am ashamed and I know it deeply hurt him).|d1y3j7z|1353
I have also started getting involved in the community working with survivors and people affected by suicide.|d1y3j7z|1354
All of these reasons keep me from attempting again.|d1y3j7z|1355
There is not a cure and the feelings never fully go away, but you can find things worth living for.|d1y3j7z|1356
Well I have never had the balls to straight up kill myself but I used to be addicted to heroin for 4 years.|d1y55p6|1357
I never consciously tried to overdose but if I just so happened to and died from it well that would have just been alright.|d1y55p6|1358
Shit everytime I stuck that needle in my arm I was playing Russian roulette.|d1y55p6|1359
Like I said I did not have a death wish but I used to be super depressed and did not feel I had much to live for.|d1y55p6|1360
Once I saw the light and knew there was much more to live for I moved on.|d1y55p6|1361
Now I can deal with daily life and most emotions I face.|d1y55p6|1362
Basic thing is to know you cannot get through anything like this alone.|d1y55p6|1363
Help is always there do not be afraid to ask.|d1y55p6|1364
I was for 4 years and I could have very well died.|d1y55p6|1365
Now I have almost a year clean and life is okay.|d1y55p6|1366

"I remember that while the pills were beginning to take effect, my mother and brother were fighting over a school project of his and I  remember thinking 'Can''t I die in peace?'"""|d1yghb9|1390

"When I woke up the next morning, my first thought was '""God dammnit, I cannot even kill myself properly!'"""|d1yghb9|1392
My failure had only served to make me more suicidal and I tried two more times before my mother realized how depressed I was and that me being suicidal would be great leverage over my father, so she got me help.|d1yghb9|1393

Then realised due a lack of oxygen and head injury was just making me confused..[BK][BK]Second time many years later threw myself over a bridge at night onto train tracks, hit a post/ pillar in he middle of the tracks, landed on the floor managing to knock myself out.|d1yh5z1|1398
I was severely injured but survived.|d1yh5z1|1399
My first thought then was how funny it was I had headphones in, my phone had hit shuffle and 'do not fear the reaper' was playing..|d1yh5z1|1400
I tried with an old belt tucked into the top of my closet door, I remember visualizing what happened when you die as I was choking, it was a really surreal moment, the blacker it got, the more vivid the image in my mind became, it was really beautiful, I saw clouds.|d1yg8tg|1401

A day after Christmas last year I found myself extremely desperate to make my life come to an end, so conveniently my parents were out in town and we just happen to own two rifles and some ammunition from when we go shooting at a gun club.|d1yeajd|1421
[BK][BK]You can probably see where this is going but yeah I decided to get one of the rifles out and load it with some ammunition.|d1yeajd|1422
So I did exactly that and then I put the rifle up under my chin because that was easiest way I found to have it.|d1yeajd|1423
I had the gun loaded and the firing pin ready.|d1yeajd|1424
[BK][BK]Just as I went to pull the trigger, I had decided I was not going to go through with it and so I went to move my finger away from the trigger but instead actually accidentally pulled the trigger and I was sure that was the end of it.|d1yeajd|1425
[BK][BK]Anyway lucky for me somehow the bullet got jammed in the barrel because when I loaded it, it managed to go in on a weird angle.|d1yeajd|1426
Anyway so that is why I am here still and things are getting a little bit better as they go.|d1yeajd|1427
Although I especially feel like a douche for making an attempt on my life on the day after Christmas, let alone doing it at all.|d1yeajd|1428
[BK][BK]Anyway still here so hurray.|d1yeajd|1429
[BK][BK]TL:DR - Loaded gun, realised I did not want to do it, accidentally pulled trigger and luckily the bullet jammed in barrel.|d1yeajd|1430
Tried to hang myself at 20.|d1yemtc|1431
The last thing I thought before my roommate walked in on me was how horrible it was going to be for my roommate, my friends, my parents, my brother.|d1yemtc|1432
Bless the dude's heart though, he literally saved my life, and will always be my best friend.|d1yemtc|1433
[BK][BK]Still think about suicide almost every day (26 now) but it is easier to manage with therapy and medication, and I know I will never try it again because that thought about the people who would be affected still chills me to the bone.|d1yemtc|1434
I swallowed 66 Ativan during a time when I was homeless for a few days in 2011.|d1ye82z|1435
There is a huge list of reasons as to why I did it, but suffice it to say I did it.|d1ye82z|1436
[BK][BK][BK][BK]I swallowed them in a super Wal-Mart parking lot in the early afternoon.|d1ye82z|1437
I woke up the next day in the hospital feeling like crap.|d1ye82z|1438
I turns out I had swallowed them and for some reason in my drug-induced delirium decided it was okay to try and drive somewhere else - I ended up hitting a parked police vehicle that had an officer just sitting inside doing whatever.|d1ye82z|1439
I was told the officer said he went up to my window and noticed I was passing in and out of consciousness and he dragged me out of my car and put me in his cruiser and took me to the hospital.|d1ye82z|1440
[BK][BK][BK]While there, they pumped my stomach but that was not the end of it.|d1ye82z|1441
The nurse told me that I had repeatedly tried opening or smashing open the window on the 3rd floor I was on so I could jump.|d1ye82z|1442
I kept screaming something along the lines of, 'I just want to die!|d1ye82z|1443
"Just let me die, I do not want to live anymore!'"""|d1ye82z|1444
They then handcuffed me to a bed or something.|d1ye82z|1445
[BK][BK]Edit: Wanted to clarify as I wrote this in the morning when I had just woken up.|d1ye82z|1446
When I said I tried to drive somewhere, that is true.|d1ye82z|1447
However, I left out that I did not get very far as I hit the parked police car IN the Wal-Mart parking lot.|d1ye82z|1448
Furthermore, I was driving slowly enough that there was absolutely no damage to either his police cruiser or my own.|d1ye82z|1449
I had to have been going >5 MPH when I hit him as the officer said it was no more than a light bump for himself in the vehicle.|d1ye82z|1450
The morning I woke up he and I talked for a few minutes or seconds, the time is very jarbled for me until the day after or so, I just remember him telling me that and then him shaking my hand and hoping I get help.|d1ye82z|1451
As to my first thought, I do not remember.|d1ye82z|1452
"Just confusion.   """|d1ye82z|1453

[BK][BK]I called 911 to Baker Act myself.|d1ymwl1|1459
You''d think my coughing would be a clue that I needed help.|d1ymwl1|1460
The operator told me that I could not Baker Act myself, someone had to call and report me, and that my attempt had to meet some threshold of severity before they would send help.|d1ymwl1|1461
[BK][BK]I learned that help was for others and not for me.|d1ymwl1|1462

So for all those who replied to this thread who''re still struggling to deal with suicidal ideation and depression and any of that, from someone who is been through all that shit, all the doctors and hospitals, it eventually does start to get better.|d1y7x3n|1500

I weeped and it was in that moment that I realized that I did not want to die.|d1yfrn6|1512

Here's a copy of the post I made two weeks after the attempt:[BK][BK]Two weeks ago I had a kind of good day but for some reason I decided to end it all that Wednesday.|d1y8ddq|1520
I could not find a reason to go on anymore.|d1y8ddq|1521
I took the remainder of my previous antidepressants (citalopram) and put all of it in a cup of tea.|d1y8ddq|1522
Never had I drunk something so disgusting.|d1y8ddq|1523
I threw up a bit but drank all of the suicide cocktail.|d1y8ddq|1524
[BK]I felt at peace and became very, very sleepy.|d1y8ddq|1525
[BK]When I went to lie down on my bed I passed our immediately.|d1y8ddq|1526
I woke up the next day and it was a pretty fucking good day.|d1y8ddq|1527
The stupid thing is that it was an ordinary day, there was nothing special about it.|d1y8ddq|1528
For some reason I was happy again.|d1y8ddq|1529
[BK][BK]That's it.|d1y8ddq|1530
Next month is going to be the one-year anniversary.|d1y8ddq|1531
Honestly?|d1y4wke|1532
I guess I was kind of glad in a sense.|d1y4wke|1533
As I was swallowing every pill I could get my hands on, I felt sad knowing that if this was the end of me then my best friend would probably never even know I passed & think for so long that we had fallen out or that I hated them.|d1y4wke|1534
[BK][BK]Though, realistically, this means my next attempt will likely be coupled with preparation and goodbye notes.|d1y4wke|1535
And I would not want to be the person to write something like that only to survive.|d1y4wke|1536
I mean...|d1y4wke|1537
Bit awkward.|d1y4wke|1538
Confusion.|d1y2wu4|1539
So much confusion.|d1y2wu4|1540
I woke up behind a maglock door handcuffed to a bed.|d1y2wu4|1541
That''s all that was in the room.|d1y2wu4|1542
Me and the bed.|d1y2wu4|1543
I started crying, asking for help.|d1y2wu4|1544
A male nurse came in and was very annoyed and kind of rude to me.|d1y2wu4|1545
[BK][BK] I found out later, I had drank half a bottle of vodka and taken a bunch of painkillers and sleeping pills.|d1y2wu4|1546
I somehow managed to get myself on a city bus, and get off at the stop at the hospital.|d1y2wu4|1547
[BK][BK]Apparently I stormed into the ER and collapsed.|d1y2wu4|1548
Woke up, tried to fight the nurse, police came in, cuffed me, they gave me a sedative and 15 hours later I woke up.|d1y2wu4|1549

Downed myself with antidepressants and found myself to be still alive the following morning.|d1yga0s|1560
I looked over to my younger brother on the next bed and i broke down silently in bed.|d1yga0s|1561
I dont recall how i really felt.|d1yga0s|1562
I just cried and got out to shower and attended school.|d1yga0s|1563
This had happened several times.|d1yga0s|1564
[BK][BK]My mother passed away 13 years ago and my dad and stepmother divorced after five years of marriage.|d1yga0s|1565
My dad was not the father figure he was supposed to be; abandoning us to ourselves in the house whilst he had to deal with his own issues.|d1yga0s|1566
"I created a strong bond with my younger brother and thinking back, i am glad i hadnt 'tried harder'""."|d1yga0s|1567
Ive been off meds for over four years now and my brother has been doing good in school and is now in the rugby team.|d1yga0s|1568
I wouldnt deny that what i did was selfish.|d1yga0s|1569
But what i would like to point out is suicide always seems to be the easist way out.|d1yga0s|1570
As much as your friends or society tells us that suicide is never the solution, when youre in a dark place and youre suffocating,  tearing up the wound wide open big enough to numb it seems to be the only option.|d1yga0s|1571

Freshman year of college I punched out a window and crawled out onto a 12th story ledge of a dorm.|d1y6b3e|1574
"I sat on that ledge for three hours, when I finally went back in to the waiting arms of the first responders and they sat me down to bandage my shredded arm was, 'fuck, I am gonna be '""that kid'"" from now on."|d1y6b3e|1575
"Second thought was '""fuck, I was supposed to go duck hunting on Saturday, now I will not get to own a gun'"" it is funny."|d1y6b3e|1576
I do not remember very much of when I was on the ledge.|d1y6b3e|1577
Just a view like picture memories, no dialogues.|d1y6b3e|1578
I remember thinking that I had a hell of a view, and a voice inside yelling jump.|d1y6b3e|1579
I get a weird feeling every time I drive past that dorm, but I always get proud that I went back to school.|d1y6b3e|1580
"Don''t feel like that kid now though, also I fuckin love all my Guns. """|d1y6b3e|1581
dad found out i was taking like 20 ambien and like a bottle of valium and it was too late and i passed the fuck out when the ambulance came but i didnt do shit other then make me feel like shit for the next 3 days... my parents didnt even say anything to me after that... asked to see a tharapist but it never happened lmao if i die at 18 i just know i was a huge burden on my whole family and they all hate me for being a fucking loser... tried so many times after that with even more ambien and benzos but now i know it will never kill me but its all i have and im too much of a pussy to slit my wrists... fuck cutting yourself i have too many scars that will never go away|d1y658a|1582

Luckily I had my health insurance to cover 80%.|d1y75j7|1585
But I also realized what I had just put my family, friends, and my partner at the time through.|d1y75j7|1586
I was looking for a quick way out; I did not want to deal with the pain or consequences that had just recently occurred.|d1y75j7|1587
Looking back now I realized that was not the answer.|d1y75j7|1588
Even now I sometimes struggle keeping those thoughts from entering my mind or letting them control me.|d1y75j7|1589
I have so much to live for and now that I am a uncle to my 3 month old nephew I have to keep pushing myself and telling myself that I am worth it.|d1y75j7|1590

As i was laying in some sewer gutter over looking a freeway, my mind and body were shutting down already in and out of consciousness, i looked down at my arm gushing with blood, i remembered my little sisters (8yrs old) face before I left the house earlier that day,  she was telling me how she wanted to play outside with me.|d1ygg2d|1593
I remember thinking of her and telling myself i have to wake up and stop the bleeding somehow... the place i was at was on a trail behind a park, i started to drag myself towards the park with blood gushing down my arm i do not know how but i manged to tie a tall grass around my upper bicep to slow the bleeding, drank a lot of water at the fountain and washed the blood from my arms so i can make it home without anyone knowing what was going on.|d1ygg2d|1594
[BK] I never went to the hospital, parents never found out,  they asked about my cut though about a month after on a day when i wore a tank top and that is the first thing they noticed.|d1ygg2d|1595
i still have a scar, i cut myself on my bicep right where the vein is, that no one knows how it got there, except for you guys first time telling anyone about this.|d1ygg2d|1596

"Tl;dr: 'A wordless, seething shame, '"" as another user in this thread so accurately and eloquently described."|d1yfukp|1601
[BK][BK]To keep backgrounds short, I was a high-schooler facing neglect by my parents.|d1yfukp|1602
My main supports were my friends, who I would kept since elementary school (a few of which are still my closest friends to this day.)|d1yfukp|1603
These people, who had kept me around at my best and worse times when others would not, became the family I did not have at home.|d1yfukp|1604
[BK][BK]I had a very specific suicide plan in place.|d1yfukp|1605
I planned to OD on my sleeping meds at school an hour before lunch (since it took an hour and a half for my normal doses to kick in) so that I would be able to spend my last bit of time with my friends (my *family*.)|d1yfukp|1606
I would then break away during lunch to walk a nearby path that led to a rock overlooking the Penobscot river.|d1yfukp|1607
That was where I planned on peacefully falling asleep and dying.|d1yfukp|1608
[BK][BK]I am sure anybody even marginally smarter than I was is able to see the flaws in my plan.|d1yfukp|1609
[BK][BK]To keep things basic, medications do not work that way.|d1yfukp|1610
I OD''d when I would planned to, but having taken 16 times my average dose, it only took about 15 minutes for the effects to kick in as opposed to the hour and a half I had been expecting.. and there is not a peaceful fucking thing about overdosing.|d1yfukp|1611
[BK][BK]I was in the middle of English class, my last class before lunch, when I began to feel the effects of my overdose.|d1yfukp|1612
I tried playing it off, believing I could make it the last half an hour.|d1yfukp|1613
I thought I had been maintaining composure well enough to appear fine, but the people around me kept looking at me and asking me if I was okay.|d1yfukp|1614
I felt light-headed, nauseous, and was weak to the point where it was hard to lift my head.|d1yfukp|1615
That''s when I became scared.|d1yfukp|1616
[BK][BK]I felt like absolute shit.|d1yfukp|1617
I could hardly move, but felt extremely nauseous.|d1yfukp|1618
I knew I would be laying on my desk, in the middle of class, soaked in my own sick very soon.|d1yfukp|1619
I would OD''d to chase away the pain, not to find myself humiliated and scared in the middle of a room filled with people, the majority of which I hardly knew.|d1yfukp|1620
I am not sure I regretted wanting to die, but I surely regretted the details.|d1yfukp|1621
[BK][BK]I remember interrupting the teacher mid-lecture, slurring that I needed to go to the nurse''s office before stumbling out of the room and puking in the middle of the hallway.|d1yfukp|1622
I remember crying, knowing everyone I would left behind in class knew I was fucked up.|d1yfukp|1623
Everything is hazy afterwards, but I eventually found myself waiting for an ambulance on a cot in the nurse''s office, with the school officer and my mother both present.|d1yfukp|1624
[BK][BK]I do not remember feeling disappointed or grateful for being alive - all I can remember is the overwhelming shame that I felt.|d1yfukp|1625
[BK][BK]My mother stared at me for awhile without saying a word.|d1yfukp|1626
The officer left the room for a moment, and I took the opportunity to ask her what she was thinking.|d1yfukp|1627
Looking straight into my eyes, the one sentence she spared me was to let me know how disappointed she was in me.|d1yfukp|1628
In that moment, I wished I could have been given a do-over.|d1yfukp|1629
I doubt that is a memory that will ever stop hurting.|d1yfukp|1630
"I wish I could say that I had some big '""aha!'"""|d1yfukp|1631
moment in this, but unless we are talking about the realization that my mother is a huge ass, it just was not there.|d1yfukp|1632
[BK][BK]To anybody who may be reading my post and feeling suicidal - do not be discouraged by this.|d1yfukp|1633
There may not have been a huge life-changing epiphany for me in the experience, however, it is been five years and I am still alive.|d1yfukp|1634
This only proves that the big learning moments come through trying to live, not trying to die.|d1yfukp|1635
When you are at your lowest is when you have got to work your hardest.|d1yfukp|1636
Know that you **CAN** do it,  you **ARE** worth it, and that finding happiness **IS** possible.|d1yfukp|1637
It''s been five years for me, and honestly I still feel bad just as often as I feel good, but even so, I am so proud of myself.|d1yfukp|1638
I have worked hard every day, and even though I have slipped and fallen back into old habits during my journey, I still know that I am capable of progressing towards something better than what I am now.|d1yfukp|1639
Anyone and everyone is, but it is on the individual to take those hard and rewarding steps.|d1yfukp|1640
If you cannot do it yourself, remember to seek out professional help, or at the very least support from your loved ones.|d1yfukp|1641

[BK][BK]My first thought was how pathetic I was for not even being able to kill myself.|d1y845u|1648
I was on my bed so I just went to sleep straight after and started planning and researching a better way to do it with what little means I had.|d1y845u|1649
[BK][BK]I have only really tried once after that and my sister caught me before I could do any real damage the second time.|d1y845u|1650

I figured no one would care or were not close enough to care, but even people I hardly spoke to showed concern.|d1y845u|1652

[BK][BK]Second time I tried to OD on 6 mg of xanax, a bottle of vodka, two 40 oz, a bottle of wine, three games of weed, and 2 grams of ketamine.|d1y6i4j|1742
[BK][BK]Woke up the next morning without even a hangover.|d1y6i4j|1743
[BK][BK]That was when I realized I am not going to get to kill myself.|d1y6i4j|1744
Then I thought, that maybe, just maybe, I was supposed to do something.|d1y6i4j|1745
[BK][BK]I am trying to figure that out still, but I have done a lot of interesting things since.|d1y6i4j|1746
[BK][BK]Gone to rehab and gotten clean, gone to Israel and taught English to Bedouins, moved to the middle east for good.|d1y6i4j|1747
[BK][BK]It was a few years after the suicide attempts I received a huge head injury and my depression more or less dissapated.|d1y6i4j|1748
The first time I tried to jump in front of a car.|d1y6mw8|1749
I jumped too early and they missed by inches.|d1y6mw8|1750
"I thought, 'Aw, dammit!'"""|d1y6mw8|1751
I think I was in 2nd grade.|d1y6mw8|1752
[BK][BK]The next time I was in 4th grade and I tried to drown myself in a pool.|d1y6mw8|1753
"A stranger pulled me out before I blacked out from holding my breath and my first thought was also my first words, '""Fuck you!'""."|d1y6mw8|1754
[BK][BK]Both time I guess my first thought was an angry thought that expressed my anger towards being so shit at life I could not even kill myself, and anger towards the people around me who just could not let it happen.|d1y6mw8|1755
[BK][BK]The last time was in college and I tried to OD on acetaminophen but ended up throwing the pills up.|d1y6mw8|1756
This was right after my sister had tried to cut her wrists and I was having an incredibly hard time working through the trauma of being the one who found her in the bathroom all bloody.|d1y6mw8|1757
"My first thought was, '""Not doing it that way again.'"""|d1y6mw8|1758
because it fucking sucked.|d1y6mw8|1759
[BK][BK]I have not told anyone in my family or group of friends about that last one, and I probably will not.|d1y6mw8|1760
Not because I am done trying to kill myself, but because I finally found a good way to do it and it is kind of comforting knowing I have a good way out if I ever really cannot go on anymore.|d1y6mw8|1761
"It''s kinda peaceful thinking about it."""|d1y6mw8|1762
I was 15.|d1ykpq9|1763
Coming near the end of my sophomore year of high school.|d1ykpq9|1764
It was 3:45 am.|d1ykpq9|1765
I had went down into the basement of my father house where the fun safe was located.|d1ykpq9|1766
My father taught me the combination in case of any emergencies in which I would need a gun to protect myself or the house, or grab important documents from it in the event of some disaster.|d1ykpq9|1767
[BK][BK]I grabbed the first pistol I saw, a colt .45 that was my grandfathers.|d1ykpq9|1768
Now we kept a separate ammo can but in the safe was a blue box of old ammunition for the pistol of my choice.|d1ykpq9|1769
I inserted a single round into the chamber and closed the bolt.|d1ykpq9|1770
[BK][BK]The next 10 seconds felt like years.|d1ykpq9|1771
It seemed as if time slowed down or even came to a complete stop around me, as if I was the only one not affected by it.|d1ykpq9|1772
Any and all sounds and bent noose just ceased.|d1ykpq9|1773
[BK][BK]All of that was just the 10 seconds it took for me to put the gun to my right temple and pull the trigger, hoping for nothingness.|d1ykpq9|1774
[BK][BK]All I heard was a click.|d1ykpq9|1775
I pulled back the bolt and the round came out.|d1ykpq9|1776
I checked the back of it only to see a dent from the firing pin in the primer.|d1ykpq9|1777
[BK][BK]I just broke down in that moment.|d1ykpq9|1778
I was crying on the floor for about an hour until I realized my dad would be getting up soon for work.|d1ykpq9|1779
I went back to my room and laid in my bed, only able to think about what had just happened.|d1ykpq9|1780
I went to school the next morning as if nothing happened.|d1ykpq9|1781
[BK][BK]It's now been almost 3 years since that.|d1ykpq9|1782
I am now 18 going on 19 in a couple months.|d1ykpq9|1783
I am now a college student or was.|d1ykpq9|1784
I was recently put in a psychiatric ward because the first appointment I ever made with a counselor in an attempt to finally get help, led  to the fear of me killing myself again.|d1ykpq9|1785
[BK][BK]I am now on medication.|d1ykpq9|1786
Not really doing better so I am going to ask my doctor about trying different medication.|d1ykpq9|1787
I have moved back home to go to community college and work while I get things in my life sorted out.|d1ykpq9|1788
[BK][BK]Not a day goes by where I do not think about me shooting myself 3 years ago.|d1ykpq9|1789
My first thought was that I would never do it again; putting my family in that position was far too horrific for me.|d1y8b0n|1790
[BK][BK]And then I attempted again.|d1y8b0n|1791
And again.|d1y8b0n|1792
I am at 15 times total.|d1y8b0n|1793
Been in and out of mental hospitals throughout my life.|d1y8b0n|1794
[BK][BK]I am finally on my feet and feeling better but goddamn if I am not worried I will go back there again.|d1y8b0n|1795
[BK][BK]Being autistic and trans is hard.|d1y8b0n|1796
I am so isolated.|d1y8b0n|1797
Everyone thinks I am weird.|d1y8b0n|1798
I do not understand people, sometimes I feel like people just tolerate me and want me to go away.|d1y8b0n|1799
[BK][BK]It's dealing with all that that makes me worry that I will go for a 16th attempt, but I hope not.|d1y8b0n|1800
:/|d1y8b0n|1801
To be honest, I do not remember.|d1y8ihs|1802
I lost about a week of my life.|d1y8ihs|1803
I somehow moved down the road to my friend's house and fell asleep in my friend's bed, and he checked every few hours to make sure I was still breathing.|d1y8ihs|1804
I think I just slept for most of that week, I just completely shut down.|d1y8ihs|1805
It's just a big huge black space in my life.|d1y8ihs|1806
My friends called an anonymous couple or something and two people came down to talk to me, and they talked me into checking myself into the hospital.|d1y8ihs|1807
[BK][BK]Best decision of my life.|d1y8ihs|1808
Mostly annoyed.|d1y8jbw|1809
The gun just refused to go off, both with freshly reloaded rounds, and factory loads.|d1y8jbw|1810
I got pissed off and chucked the shotgun under my bed and took a nap.|d1y8jbw|1811
Went to the range later on with my dad, and did not miss a single shot with the same rounds that refused to kill me.|d1y8jbw|1812
That was the last honest attempt I made, about 7 years ago.|d1y8jbw|1813
I have had the thought about once a month, and came really damn close about two years ago, but I learned from my dad growing up that all a man has is his word, and I gave my word to too many people to try again.|d1y8jbw|1814
So I just sit here and suffer while people try to cheer me up or ask what is going on.|d1y8jbw|1815
How the fuck am I still here...quickly followed how the fuck did I just do something so selfish|d1ydkqw|1816
I stopped halfway through my attempt because I panicked and was not sure about it.|d1y90un|1817
My first thought was that I could not stand the thought of leaving my dog alone.|d1y90un|1818
[BK][BK]I told my mom and she was annoyed that I needed to go to the hospital on a school night.|d1y90un|1819
When we got there and the doctors rushed me in, then she started to cry about being a bad mom and I had to console her all night.|d1y90un|1820
The doctors consoled her as well.|d1y90un|1821
She persuaded me to say it was an accident and they let me go without any follow up.|d1y90un|1822
[BK][BK]The next week I tried sleeping pills but an ambiguous amount - sort of like Russian roulette with pills.|d1y90un|1823
Obviously it was not enough but I did not tell anyone that time.|d1y90un|1824
When I was 22 I tried to end my life.|d1z2zvf|1825
It was a very dark time in my life and I had recently reached out to a woman that I loved and she talked to me and, to make a long story short she came to my home and left as promptly as she showed which really put me in a bad state of mind.|d1z2zvf|1826
I attempted to use a S&W .40 M&P edition.|d1z2zvf|1827
If anyone here knows about this weapon is that it is safety is on the trigger and not one that has to be actively be engaged or disengaged.|d1z2zvf|1828
When I tried to pull the trigger, my finger was too high in the trigger well and the gun did not go off, thank god.|d1z2zvf|1829
I dropped it and laid in my bed and thought about how that moment would have effected everyone that I knew and loved me and I just could not do that to them, so I sold my gun.|d1z2zvf|1830
[BK][BK]Now, I am happily married(to that woman, yes) and have two wonderful dogs that I care the world for and have a great support system here in my home.|d1z2zvf|1831
It's still hard to talk about my depression and it still sticks with me, but I fight it tooth and nail every day.|d1z2zvf|1832
I am glad I survived and I am more than happy to tell others out there dealing with the same pain that I had... that it is OK. You are a wonderful person and there are things meant for you out there.|d1z2zvf|1833
Don't let those thoughts slip into your mind and change your patterns.|d1z2zvf|1834
Don't let your depression control you; I did and I am ashamed I ever let it happen.|d1z2zvf|1835
Read this and learn from it, know that taking your life is not the answer.|d1z2zvf|1836
[BK][BK]If any of you read this and need help, message me here.|d1z2zvf|1837
I might not respond right away but I will talk to you if you feel you have nowhere else to go.|d1z2zvf|1838
"'Fuck.'"""""|d1yh4ry|1839
Maybe this dosent count as much as others, but I had the noose set up and everything, and just as I was about to kick out my desk chair from under me, I saw (yeah this it totally ridiculous) a ticket stub from a football match I went to.|d1y74h5|1840
I just thought 'well, that was a fun time.|d1y74h5|1841
"Maybe there are things I could live for'""."|d1y74h5|1842
Took down the noose and went back to bed.|d1y74h5|1843
It''s only been on the up and up from there, thankfully.|d1y74h5|1844
[BK][BK]Edit: fuck, this brings back a lot of memories.|d1y74h5|1845
I thought I would add a little more.|d1y74h5|1846
I had everything laid out (note that left my PC to my best friend, my magic the gathering stuff to a friend who was in to the game, whatever cash I had at the time to a local homeless charity, asking my parents/whoever found me to move on swiftly from what happened, etc) and I just sort of decided to not do it.|d1y74h5|1847
It''s all surreal and the memories from the 2 or so years I was suicidal a lot of the time are just sort of a blur (this was nearly 2 years ago when I sort of came out of it), so I do not remember much else from the time.|d1y74h5|1848
I have gotten more involved in volunteer work and stuff which helps a lot.|d1y74h5|1849
My honest advice is to go get help.|d1y74h5|1850
I was helped out a lot by free counseling/therapy sessions thanks to nationalised healthcare in the UK, but if you do not have the luxury of universal healthcare/money for therapy then there are a million and one ways to get out of it.|d1y74h5|1851
"If anyone''s needing some help or advice feel free to PM me."""|d1y74h5|1852
Again, again, again.|d1yejt4|1853
Need to try again.|d1yejt4|1854
So I did.|d1yejt4|1855
I was in shock.|d1y9ipz|1856
I had broken many bones in my face and my hip, blood was gushing down my face.|d1y9ipz|1857
I remember the feeling of falling and how it seemed to happen so fast.|d1y9ipz|1858
But once you hurt yourself that bad it overrides any other thought and you immediately think about getting to a hospital.|d1y9ipz|1859
[BK][BK]Now, I think about how it actually could have killed me or paralyzed me.|d1y9ipz|1860
I do not remember any exact thoughts, just a general sense of confusion.|d1y9h4d|1861
And a massive pain in my head.|d1y9h4d|1862
I was 15, tried to hang myself with bedsheets and TL;DR my half-assed noose came undone after I passed out, I fell, and smacked my head really fucking hard.|d1y9h4d|1863
Wouldn't suicide failures be a better term?|d1yf41q|1864
I went for liver damage.|d1yb2w2|1865
I am talking acetaminophen and booze.|d1yb2w2|1866
"I was going shot for pill when a girl I was sort of seeing at the time was invited over by my roommate (we were all old high school friends) and she bursted into my room with a big old 'It''s great to see you because this is probably going to be the start of  a significant relationship between us!'"""|d1yb2w2|1867
Grin on her face.|d1yb2w2|1868
I obviously stopped trying to poison myself because I was now entertaining a guest.|d1yb2w2|1869
"I was new to alcohol at the time and I felt woozy. """|d1yb2w2|1870
I hated myself.|d1y8cq1|1871
I was such a failure at life that I could not even die correctly.|d1y8cq1|1872
After I left my note where it would have been found, I was weighed down with regret and embarrassment.|d1y8cq1|1873
I had to face everyone after the stunt I pulled.|d1y8cq1|1874
Once I was allowed to have visitors, my parents were the first to see me.|d1y8cq1|1875
I could not even say a word before they both had their arms around me, crying.|d1y8cq1|1876
Every negative emotion I had at that moment washed away.|d1y8cq1|1877
I felt the sincerity in the way they held me.|d1y8cq1|1878
I felt loved.|d1y8cq1|1879
I still battle my depression.|d1y8cq1|1880
It's even gotten crippling as of recently.|d1y8cq1|1881
But as long as at least one person loves me the way my parents do, I know I am not completely alone.|d1y8cq1|1882
'This is not me.|d1y8w27|1883
I do not do these things.|d1y8w27|1884
"'""[BK][BK]The morning after a party where I took a bottle of whiskey,  wearing only indoor clothes,  ventured around and drank,  sobbing about a woman I loved but who never loved me back."|d1y8w27|1885
Ended up sleeping in snow for an hour and half, was later found by classmates at the party who brought me back inside,  put me down at sauna room with blankets and pillows.|d1y8w27|1886
I am quite grateful to those lads.|d1y8w27|1887
I never have mentioned anyone why I went out like that,  but I just wished to freeze to death.|d1y8w27|1888
"All they know is that I just got real drunk and went out for a cigarette,  fell and was too wasted to make it back. """|d1y8w27|1889
I do not know why but after going through severe depression with no treatment I have become exceptionally angry towards other suicidal people.|d1y3wgv|1890
[BK][BK]Like, I never explicitly tried to kill myself I just put myself into increasingly dangerous situations where I hoped I would die.|d1y3wgv|1891
I got into super bad longboard accidents, got hit by a car, got physically harmed in some way, but the next thought was always *I can do better*.|d1y3wgv|1892
[BK][BK]For some reason I never think about killing myself any more - it is always about getting myself killed.|d1y3wgv|1893
[BK][BK]A year ago?|d1y3wgv|1894
I thought about killing myself all the time.|d1y3wgv|1895
Daily, multiple times.|d1y3wgv|1896
I had several plans for how I would do it, but I was too scared of pain to go through.|d1y3wgv|1897
[BK][BK]I do not know why I am different now - I have never seen a therapist or gotten pills, I guess it is just like the end is in sight.|d1y3wgv|1898
First time (age 13): 'I lived through this, so I guess that means I am alive for a reason.|d7ok8ql|1899

I put way too much importance on her friendship and her opinion of me.|d7ok8ql|1903
(I was in love with her and I am female and she was very homophobic, it was a messed up situation that contributed to my being suicidal.)|d7ok8ql|1904
"[BK][BK]Third and final attempt (age 16): '""Fuck!"|d7ok8ql|1905

Thank Goodness, two security guards physically restrained me from leaving.|d7ok8ql|1909
[BK][BK]Update on my life: I am 32 now and am very grateful to be alive.|d7ok8ql|1910
I have had many good times since those suicidal days of my teens, and bad  times too.|d7ok8ql|1911
Lately I have been going through a painful time.|d7ok8ql|1912
But through it all I stay grateful to be alive.|d7ok8ql|1913
The most important thing is I have found meaning in my life, a commitment and desire to try to make the world a better place, and use my life for that purpose.|d7ok8ql|1914
This keeps me with a strong will to live even when there is pain.|d7ok8ql|1915

Hi,[BK][BK]I know many will not even read this, but I just want you to know that no matter how low a point in your life you think you are, there will always be someone willing to listen to you, talk to you, care for you.|d1ya6rp|1917
I want you all to know that I really love you, and am here for you to talk to, a non-judgmental faceless individual over the internet, probably continents away.|d1ya6rp|1918
I will most likely never see your face, and you mine, but I want to talk to you.|d1ya6rp|1919
I want to know your story.|d1ya6rp|1920
[BK][BK]I love you.|d1ya6rp|1921
Talk to me.|d1ya6rp|1922

Then I went the next day.|d1y98ug|1930
And the day after that, and I just did not stop.|d1y98ug|1931
Now I am in peak physical condition and I am better than I have ever been at MMA.|d1y98ug|1932

Interesting thread.|d1ya0j9|1938
I have been thinking about suicide often lately, usually every day.|d1ya0j9|1939
I just cannot shake the thought of it.|d1ya0j9|1940
But I also do not really know how to do it - no high buildings in my area, not an easy access to guns, not a huge amount of pills availabe.|d1ya0j9|1941
I am really scared of being in pain during or after it - if I survive.|d1ya0j9|1942
[BK][BK]So I probably will have to live with this for a while...[BK][BK]I wanted to write something at /depression or another sub, but I just do not have the energy to do so.|d1ya0j9|1943
*'No!|d1yan8g|1944
No!|d1yan8g|1945
Shit!|d1yan8g|1946
Fuck!|d1yan8g|1947

"'""*[BK][BK]A few seconds later my father and brother walked in and found me looking bewildered sitting next to the ceiling fan and tiles on the floor."|d1yan8g|1949

I am bipolar, and I could not remember the feeling of emptiness.|d1yannk|1953
At the time I could not understand why I could not remember the emotion, I had the memories of the experience but I could not remember the feeling.|d1yannk|1954
So I cried.|d1yannk|1955
Why the fuck did not it work?|d1yc2c8|1956
Do i really have to put up with this all again?|d1yc2c8|1957
It's gonna be even worse now because I failed.|d1yc2c8|1958
I kept trying to find a way out as soon as possible.|d1yc2c8|1959
Hell, even years later I am still in the same boat.|d1yc2c8|1960
There's nothing i can do about it, i just do not care about my life anymore.|d1yc2c8|1961

Late in the party, but here is my answer: I do not remember.|d1yc12e|1966
[BK][BK]I never used to have feelings back in those days.|d1yc12e|1967
If I had, I would have never decided to leave my parents to deal with my dead body.|d1yc12e|1968
[BK][BK]However, I am thankful that I survived, because my suicide note was embarassingly cringeworthy :-P|d1yc12e|1969
Relief, disappointment, and extreme fear.|d1yc2ko|1970
I wanted it to end so badly, but felt like I was too much of a pussy to do it.|d1yc2ko|1971
Now I realize that I was just having a bit of common sense.|d1yc2ko|1972
I am trying to find things to live for now, still having a bit of difficulty.|d1yc2ko|1973
Not sure if this question quite applies to me.|d1yao8c|1974
I never lost consciousness - my attempt was more missguided than anything else, and the method I chose would not have instantly killed me like I intended.|d1yao8c|1975
Rather, the pills that I swallowed would have destroyed my kidneys, and would have killed me slowly over the next few months.|d1yao8c|1976
So I did not really lose consciousness; I just swallowed a bunch of pills, washed them down with some gatorade, wandered around campus for a while, came back to my dorm, wrote a suicide note, and then called 911 on myself.|d1yao8c|1977
"[BK][BK]I guess what I realized over those few hours was 'I want to live,'"" or alternatively, '""I am afraid to die."|d1yao8c|1978
"'""[BK][BK]Either way, here I am."""|d1yao8c|1979
Mostly variations on the theme of 'Son of a bitch!|d1y5heo|1980
"'""[BK][BK]After I finished raging at life for being so awful that it would not even end, I resigned myself to what I called '""Plan B,'"" which was a much more brutal combination of a bunch of different ways of killing myself."|d1y5heo|1981
Realistically, now that I am older and not (as much of) an idiot, I realize that the only part of Plan B that might have even been remotely effective at killing a human is that it was to be done in a garage with a running car.|d1y5heo|1982
God, what a stupid plan.|d1y5heo|1983
[BK][BK]Thankfully, my confidence that Plan B would work made me reckless about keeping my damn mouth shut, and I told a couple of friends about it.|d1y5heo|1984
They talked to me for hours and eventually convinced me to *not* kill myself.|d1y5heo|1985
Instead, I just acted like an emo little shit for the next...geez, six months?|d1y5heo|1986
Eight?|d1y5heo|1987
Something like that.|d1y5heo|1988
I nearly married the girl that helped bring me out of it.|d1y5heo|1989

[BK][BK]I was driving my sister and I to school, and planned to drop her off, then drive away to find a secluded place to die.|d1y5htt|2014
I did not have a lot of options, and did not really plan it out, but I brought a bottle of caffeine pills with a combined total of about 8g of caffeine.|d1y5htt|2015
I am not positive in hindsight that it had be enough, but I did not care at the time.|d1y5htt|2016
[BK][BK]Well, my sister pieced things together.|d1y5htt|2017
She refused to get out of the car, and called my parents, who called the police.|d1y5htt|2018
I ended up getting pulled over on the highway, so I got out of the car and managed to down most of the bottle before I was tackled and arrested.|d1y5htt|2019

My first time was when I was about 15.|d1y9tj1|2040
I had found two random pills at my house (both of my parents take anti psychotics) and I thought it would be strong enough to kill me, so after lunch one day I sat on the Oval and took both of them and just lied there smoking until I passed out and then woke up to the sound of the bell and got up and walked home.|d1y9tj1|2041
"My first thought was 'shit, I have to go home'""."|d1y9tj1|2042

"Woke up still in the bath and thought '""fuck I hope no one noticed I passed out'""."|d1y9tj1|2045

[BK][BK]After that I spent 2 weeks in a psychiatric ward until I convinced everyone I was no longer a threat to myself.|d1y7ykv|2053
A few days after I got home I thought I was alone so I tried to slit my wrists, but my sister walked in on me and I was back in the psychiatric ward for another 3 weeks.|d1y7ykv|2054
I do not know why this time was different, maybe the medication was starting to work, or the intense therapy or seeing the impact it had on my family (initially I thought they were faking it because they would obviously be better off without me) but when I left hospital for the 2nd time I still wanted to die but I no longer had the will to commit suicide.|d1y7ykv|2055
[BK][BK]I am very lucky that I have such a supportive and strong family, who helped me through the next few years (I was 16 at the time), got me into see a really good psychiatrist and spoke to school so that the teachers gave me a little more support so I was not overwhelmed by the stress.|d1y7ykv|2056
I also had 4 months off school when it first happened to heal and get strong enough to go back.|d1y7ykv|2057
[BK][BK]It took around a year to be happy I did not die and a couple of years to get longer stretches of happiness.|d1y7ykv|2058

[BK][BK]First off, a small bit of background.|d1ybc4b|2196
Just over a month ago, I attempted suicide, and then the following day walked out of my school during class and walked for approximately 15 kilometers (almost 10 miles for my friends down south) in 3 hours through Canadian snow.|d1ybc4b|2197
I then spent the next 6 days in the hospital.|d1ybc4b|2198
When I attempted suicide, I felt like i was doing a selfless thing: I was ridding the world of the atrocity that is me.|d1ybc4b|2199
So I slit my wrist, and I am relatively sure that I did it right and the bleeding from my wrist would have killed me.|d1ybc4b|2200
My arm was getting numb and feeling heavy and I was getting light headed.|d1ybc4b|2201
It was because I stopped myself.|d1ybc4b|2202
I snapped out of it and immediately stopped the bleeding.|d1ybc4b|2203
I realized I may have made the wrong decision about  what I was doing, but shortly thereafter I started regretting stopping myself, and for the past month I have been very conflicted as to whether or not I did the right thing by stopping myself.|d1ybc4b|2204
Thankfully, things may be starting to work out again.|d1ybc4b|2205
I am now on medication (I was not before and I did not want any because of my very negative experience with prozac) and I will be receiving counseling, which my family and I have struggled to obtain.|d1ybc4b|2206

After going to the emergency room, I started having lots of regrets; mainly that I would called someone and did not wait it out.|d1yd7v5|2219
I woke up pissed and scared that I was still in my room that was now spinning.|d1ycdr9|2220
Immediately I ran to the bathroom because my body decided it is time to get these pills out of you.|d1ycdr9|2221
"After about 30 minutes of throwing up I thought there is still a chance I can die and that I wanted to see my ex (I was a freshman in high school young and blinded by 'love'"")."|d1ycdr9|2222
I went to see her no one around me still not knowing what I did.|d1ycdr9|2223
I told them it was just something I ate or whatever.|d1ycdr9|2224
Thinking I can hold in the vomiting to say my last good bye to her, I end up throwing up all over her driveway.|d1ycdr9|2225
From there it was to the hospital.|d1ycdr9|2226
[BK][BK][BK]I always planned on killing myself during or before high school ever since 6th grade.|d1ycdr9|2227
So when the day came I was full of adrenaline I could not even say I was relieved to escape the depression.|d1ycdr9|2228
"The whole experience just felt like all my thoughts were in a blender. """|d1ycdr9|2229
So, this was.. Two years ago.|d1y8ws8|2230
It was right after thanksgiving dinner with my family(I had been feeling like shit for weeks and holidays are always worse) and we got home around 7ish, sisters and mom left for shopping a half hour later, so a couple minutes after they had left I grabbed my meds(I was taking 5 different pills and if I remember correctly I was consuming about 1050-1075mg of meds a day) and I poured a few into my hand(the largest was 500mg and the smallest was like.. 15mg I think) and I downed them.|d1y8ws8|2231
"I woke up around 1am and my first thought was 'god damnit.. better clean this mess up before they get home.'"""|d1y8ws8|2232
Forty minutes later they were home and not a single one knew what happened, they still do not.|d1y8ws8|2233
"[BK]That was not my first attempt, my first was in 4th grade when I thought it was possible to choke myself to death"""|d1y8ws8|2234
I did not have a reaction for myself, but I told my little sister what I tried to do and she told my mom.|d1ychjh|2235
I was furious with her right up until I saw her face when I was in the hospital.|d1ychjh|2236
Out of everyone there she was the only person who is face I remember.|d1ychjh|2237
I felt like an asshole, how could I do that to my little sister; just leave her alone without a brother to look after her.|d1ychjh|2238
[BK][BK]The next time I thought about suicide was when that very same sister was pregnant.|d1ychjh|2239
I went to the hospital to see my niece who was only 8 hours old and just holding that little girl made me want to live.|d1ychjh|2240
It's been two and a half years and I no longer let myself get into those dark places.|d1ychjh|2241
I have people that care about me unconditionally, and it helps that my niece always runs to me before my sister.|d1ychjh|2242
"'Why did I ever think this was a good idea?'"""|d1zfou2|2243
I took a bunch of pills.|d1zfou2|2244
Thankfully, I had taken the pills with some spoiled milk, so I immediately puked everywhere, and I realized that I would be saying goodbye to all the people and things I cared about.|d1zfou2|2245
My cats, my parents, my family, friends, hell, even my co-workers.|d1zfou2|2246
"I admit, 18-year old u/ChevroletSparkSS was an utter fucking moron."""|d1zfou2|2247
Every time I just felt like it was going to happen again and I would keep struggling for the rest of my life & I felt very little hope.|d1zfk13|2248
For me it is like being in a drunk state, so much crying and hard breathing.|d1zfk13|2249
"So by the time I put the knife down i am dizzy and just think 'Just wait it out.'"""|d1zfk13|2250
I know it is not a great thought or motivating to hear.|d1zfk13|2251
But I know I am one to be in the extreme mode of happy or sad.|d1zfk13|2252
"I have to see every time if I am ready to be done or if I can go on."""|d1zfk13|2253
I have had two suicide attempts.|d1yd7e3|2254
And I would not lie to you and say that my suicidal ideation has gone away for good.|d1yd7e3|2255
I am at the point now where I am thankful that I did not succeed those times.|d1yd7e3|2256
You should know that I am bipolar as well.|d1yd7e3|2257
Which means I will always cycle through deep depression.|d1yd7e3|2258
"My first thought the morning after the first attempt was, 'why am I awake?'"""|d1yd7e3|2259
I was bitterly disappointed in myself for not being strong enough to make sure I was actually dying.|d1yd7e3|2260
I would tell myself that my existence was a terrible mistake that I needed to fix.|d1yd7e3|2261
That so much of my life had been awful and painfully lonely that it could not change.|d1yd7e3|2262
To make matters worse, I did not disclose my suicide attempt to my psychiatrist, I was afraid of being committed and having to go on heavier atypical antipsychotics.|d1yd7e3|2263
Don''t ignore your support system like I did.|d1yd7e3|2264
I was 19 at the time in the midst of an incredibly messed up, abusive relationship, and I almost missed out on every breathtaking moment of joy I have had since.|d1yd7e3|2265
My next suicide attempt is kind of hazy, I know it was mid June 2012, and I know that I did a significant amount of drugs to try to off myself and I remember telling my bf that I was dying and then I remember throwing up quite a bit and hoping it had been long enough that I would absorbed the pills anyways.|d1yd7e3|2266
It took me quite a while to feel better from that one.|d1yd7e3|2267
I think I even failed out of my classes, that semester.|d1yd7e3|2268
In the years since, I have ceased to continually demonize myself, my past actions and I try to focus on the future .|d1yd7e3|2269
I made a bucket list and self flagellated all over the place about the experiences I have yet to experience.|d1yd7e3|2270
I have checked off quite a few in the 6 years since my first attempt.|d1yd7e3|2271
Not nearly all, I hope I keep adding to the list throughout my life.|d1yd7e3|2272
Things that my psychiatrist said that changed me: Suicidal thoughts are not normal.|d1yd7e3|2273
It''s not normal to want to kill yourself every day, normal people do not do that.|d1yd7e3|2274
You are sick, and you cannot get better through force of will alone.|d1yd7e3|2275
Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.|d1yd7e3|2276
If your life is so awful that you are looking to run away from your problems.|d1yd7e3|2277
Actually run away, go far away to a new place, find a better solution to nonexistence.|d1yd7e3|2278
Because there is no coming back from that one.|d1yd7e3|2279
So I ran away to the circus essentially and found a better place.|d1yd7e3|2280
Art therapy saved me more than the medications did, I am down to just the art now.|d1yd7e3|2281
And my reason for existence now?|d1yd7e3|2282
"To leave the world slightly better than how I found it."""|d1yd7e3|2283
Several years ago, I attempted overdose.|d1yefob|2284
Dad found me, force-fed me ipecac, and apparently he, his girlfriend, and his girlfriend's daughter took turns holding me as I just vomited all of creation all over a tarp they laid out in the living room.|d1yefob|2285
I was not conscious for any of that.|d1yefob|2286
[BK][BK]I remember when I woke up, I was ravenous.|d1yefob|2287
I wanted nothing more than just goldfish and Pepsi, and kinda locked myself in a room to play Half-Life 2 for an hour or two.|d1yefob|2288
I just needed some sort of stability or normalcy — I was not sure how to process the fact that I was still around.|d1yefob|2289
[BK][BK]And then I went outside.|d1yefob|2290
Mind you, I had fully and entirely committed that I would not see stars again.|d1yefob|2291
I would not see green, or feel humid Florida air, or hear the breeze lazily whooshing through pine trees.|d1yefob|2292
I went outside, and it was like seeing color for the first time all over again.|d1yefob|2293
I just cried.|d1yefob|2294
I did not know why I was still around, and a large part of me was resentful that I had been saved.|d1yefob|2295
[BK][BK]But part of me was also just overwhelmed with the unending crystalline beauty of everything around me.|d1yefob|2296
And I mean EVERYthing: the humming of tires as traffic dinked about nearby was tied to bee-buzzings and a memory of a cello section from an orchestra rehearsal.|d1yefob|2297
Everything became lightly synesthetic, and I sat in the grass with a mix of happiness and dismay, just...drinking it in without judgment or decisions.|d1yefob|2298
Just feeling it all.|d1yefob|2299
So I survived because I did not pull the trigger, and neither did the police...[BK][BK]Gun pointed at my head, sitting outside my apartment complex, had written the note, called the police saying someone had been shot.|d1y9sbr|2300
You know, incase the bullet did not kill me, I would get help immediately.|d1y9sbr|2301
[BK][BK]So I am staring at about 8 cops pointing assault rifles at me, telling me to drop my weapon or they will shoot.|d1y9sbr|2302
I actually laughed at the officer that said that and called him a dumbass.|d1y9sbr|2303
And then I thought, I do not wanna be the asshole that some janitor has to clean up off the wall.|d1y9sbr|2304
So I put the gun down.|d1y9sbr|2305
[BK][BK]I was later told by the officer that arrested me I am the luckiest S.O.B.|d1y9sbr|2306
he has ever met, said he had never seen someone have that many guns trained on him, provoke the cops, have a loaded gun out, and live.|d1y9sbr|2307
"[BK][BK]My attempt may have been a different kind of survive, but my first thought when the cops came up to cuff me was 'it is going to be a hell of next few days'"" and it was."""|d1y9sbr|2308
I jumped off the overpass, 40 feet to the train tracks below.|d1yanqr|2309
I remember the breeze through my hair as I fell and the rush of feeling and euphoria that was banging to a crescendo in my chest.|d1yanqr|2310
I also remember feeling the impact.|d1yanqr|2311
Blacking out for who knows how long, seeing and feeling a white light in the distance surrounded by blackness.|d1yanqr|2312
"[BK][BK]As I came to, the first thing I thought was 'shit shit shit shit I am still alive and my right leg and hip are in excruciating pain'"", then my first coherent thought was '""Now I will have to deal with the pain I am about to cause my mother'""."""|d1yanqr|2313
A little back story.|d1yfcee|2314
I was a junior in high school, and had just told the girl who I was madly in love with that I liked her two weeks prior.|d1yfcee|2315
She rejected me, claiming to have known that I liked her for a while, she just did not say anything about it because she liked the attention.|d1yfcee|2316
Also, around this same time my grandfather went into the hospital, and my older brother was visiting home (my older brother is an all around asshole, but everyone loves him and treats me like crap when he is around).|d1yfcee|2317
[BK][BK]Day before Christmas, I decided it was time to end it all, but I did not want to ruin everyone's Christmas.|d1yfcee|2318
So I waited until the 26th, at three in the morning.|d1yfcee|2319
I took about 10 painkillers and tried to drown myself in a bath tub by filling it with water and holding my head under the faucet so that if I struggled, I would hit the faucet and stay in the water.|d1yfcee|2320
Must've lasted at least two minutes because I start to feel myself black out, but the pain in my chest became too much.|d1yfcee|2321
I jerked my head back from the tub and gasped for air.|d1yfcee|2322
The first thought I had was wishing that the girl I had liked and my brother could feel the pain I felt, and that my grandfather's pain would stop.|d1yfcee|2323
Why should someone who is led a good life suffer while these selfish people get by okay?|d1yfcee|2324
[BK][BK]No one found out about what happened that morning for months, and even today, very few people know about all of this.|d1yfcee|2325
This is the way I want to keep it (hence the throwaway), so if you are reading this and know who I am, please refrain from posting any personal details about anyone.|d1yfcee|2326
[BK][BK]Fast forward to today, where I am doing much better, enrolled in a good college, and studying hard.|d1yfcee|2327
The girl I had liked and I are good friends, my grandfather passed away last August, and my brother and I still are not on talking terms, but that is another story.|d1yfcee|2328
If there is anything I have learned, it is that hate will do you no good.|d1yfcee|2329
If anyone wrongs you, do not hold on to it.|d1yfcee|2330
Let it go, and live for the present, not the past.|d1yfcee|2331
Tried to overdose on prescription meds in college.|d1yhf3m|2332
While my first conscious thought was not exactly positive, it later put things in perspective.|d1yhf3m|2333
I woke up on my bedroom floor, 2 days later.|d1yhf3m|2334
When I was finally able to move, I reached in my pocket to find my phone.|d1yhf3m|2335
(I did not realize 2 days had passed at this point).|d1yhf3m|2336
My first thought was the realization that not one person had reached out to see where I was.|d1yhf3m|2337
I had a group of friends, none of which knew about my personal issues because I kept them to myself and these were more or less friends that could be called bad influences.|d1yhf3m|2338
Even though I could not really blame them for not checking on me, I just found it demoralizing that not one person called or asked where I was or if everything was alright.|d1yhf3m|2339
But in that brief moment of loneliness and desperation, I realized I had more to live for and that I needed to find more positive people to hang around.|d1yhf3m|2340
I called my mother, moved home, later moved out of state to a new college.|d1yhf3m|2341
Now 2 years later, I have met people that are now my closest friends, I am in my last year of school, and dating the love of my life.|d1yhf3m|2342
I made a bunch of lame attempts in middle school and highschool that in hindsight were probably never going to work (tried drowning myself a few times but instinct always got the better of me and I burst above the surface for air; tried cutting wrists but I got too scared of the pain).|d1yhq3u|2343
It always just made me hate myself more for lacking the bravery to follow through (and as many people will tell you, suicide is truly not the coward''s path: it takes guts to follow through)[BK][BK]Most recently, I had been having rather frequent (a few times daily) suicidal thoughts, and was planning on jumping out of my 4th story window.|d1yhq3u|2344
These days, the main thing keeping me from killing myself is the thought of the poor person who would find me.|d1yhq3u|2345
I really do not want to traumatize some random college student (I live on campus).|d1yhq3u|2346
The last thing they need to see is one of their peers splattered on the ground.|d1yhq3u|2347
[BK][BK]Anyways, I tried opening my window only to realize that there is a mechanism preventing it from opening more than 3 or 4 inches.|d1yhq3u|2348
Part of me was relieved, but another part was disappointed to lose my most convenient method.|d1yhq3u|2349
[BK][BK]I have tried a few therapists but it has not worked for me.|d1yhq3u|2350
I want to try medication but I cannot afford it myself and my parents do not believe in prescription medication so they will not help me get it.|d1yhq3u|2351
"They''ve also tried sending me to a few non-traditional 'psychologists'"" that, as you may predict, did not do anything except destroy what little trust I had in my parents."""|d1yhq3u|2352
I tried to OD on tylenol when I was twelve.|d1yfjdl|2353
I was tired of being thrown around between family members, spending my days skipping school to find ways to care for my siblings, since my mother worked full time and my father was out of the house 13 hours of the day, and when he was home he was strung out high or drunk and abusive in every way.|d1yfjdl|2354
[BK][BK][BK]My grandma ended up making my father take me to the ER, which he tried to avoid doing.|d1yfjdl|2355
I walked in, stood next to the bed, and apparently fainted(this was after I had already spent hours on a couch at home in and out of consciousness.|d1yfjdl|2356
[BK][BK]My first conscious thought was waking up on the hospital bed with my father laying beside me groping me.|d1yfjdl|2357
I screamed st him to get off, and thus was my first conscious thought after realizing I was still alive|d1yfjdl|2358
Honestly my first conscious thought was this.|d1yf0uk|2359
'Awesome, I cannot even fucking kill myself correctly.|d1yf0uk|2360
"'""[BK][BK]Basically I am a failure at everything I do and I even failed at suicide."|d1yf0uk|2361
Well at least no one knows about my many past attempts.|d1yf0uk|2362

[BK]My last attempt was with a revolver that did not fire until I tried to check it over to find out why.|d1yf0uk|2364
[BK][BK]I have given up on trying.|d1yf0uk|2365
I have tried, pills, ropes, jumping from heights, drowning, and lastly a gun.|d1yf0uk|2366
"Never once have I ended up in a hospital from my attempts nor does anyone know more than a injury from climbing or such."""|d1yf0uk|2367
"'Well, fuck.'"""|d1yat0j|2368
I threw up the pills.|d1yat0j|2369
I appear to be no more worse for wear.|d1yat0j|2370
[BK][BK]But to this day (18 months) I still regret not dying.|d1yat0j|2371
I have accepted this is who I am and I am not ashamed of it.|d1yat0j|2372
Had it for almost 25 years.|d1yat0j|2373
[BK][BK]I liken life to a party: you go, have a good time with a few bad moments, and at the end you are glad you went.|d1yat0j|2374
Or, like me, you have a bad time with a few good moments and yet you know you would still rather not have gone.|d1yat0j|2375
I am never going to enjoy the party.|d1yat0j|2376
Let me take my life safely and give my organs to those still enjoying the party.|d1yat0j|2377
[BK][BK]I like hearing when others have found their good times but for those out there that are not - you do not have to pretend you are enjoying to the party, just be honest you are there because your parents said so and you are just waiting to tap out.|d1yat0j|2378

"My room is going to smell awful.'"""""|d1ygc7j|2386
I woke up from being blackout drunk, vomit and pills in the toilet.|d1ylw9l|2387

[BK][BK]I have made a huge amount of progress since then.|d1ykt9q|2430
Changed jobs, moved to a cheaper location, paid off some of the debts I had, spent some time away from a very close friend of mine who had attempted suicide several times who I was crippling myself trying to help.|d1ykt9q|2431
I had not realised how much damage I was doing myself by constantly worrying about them at the time.|d1ykt9q|2432
I routinely went several days in a row without being able to sleep, even with the help of pills, and would have nightmares whenever I did manage to get some sleep.|d1ykt9q|2433
I had to take almost 3 months off work and spent almost all of it in bed.|d1ykt9q|2434

I managed to call an ambulance in a moment of clarity, I think, and next thing I know I am in a hospital.|d1ybf9b|2447
[BK][BK]I was furious and scared it did not work.|d1ybf9b|2448
I suffer from some pretty heavy PTSD after two tours in the Marines and getting shot in the leg.|d1ybf9b|2449
I have a shitty family that I acknowledge have manipulated me to stay locked in with them to take care of them and essentially be their little servant.|d1ybf9b|2450
I am studying something that I frankly have no passion for, and can barely take solace on the fact that my practice hours have gone for a good cause.|d1ybf9b|2451
I am unemployed and recently single.|d1ybf9b|2452
I wanted it all to end, and not being able to go through with it was just another failure in my life.|d1ybf9b|2453
At the same time, I cannot help but think how emotionally unstable I am, that I can just try to do something like this on a whim.|d1ybf9b|2454
[BK][BK]It''s given me some new appreciation for life.|d1ybf9b|2455
The whole incident left a very bittersweet note, as it lead to some serious complications with my liver, but it made me realize that there is people that care about me.|d1ybf9b|2456
"Cliche would, but it is keeping me going."""|d1ybf9b|2457
How timely.|d1ygwom|2458
I literally tried to commit suicide just this weekend.|d1ygwom|2459
Used an electrical cord and tied it to the door handle - I was afraid the closet beam would break.|d1ygwom|2460
"[BK][BK]I remember thinking, 'Wow this is really effective, this is really painful, this is really scary.'"""|d1ygwom|2461
Then my boyfriend came in and caught me, though I thought he was going to be gone for a while.|d1ygwom|2462
"[BK][BK]My first thought was, '""I am going to catch hell."|d1ygwom|2463
Things will be even worse now.|d1ygwom|2464
I fucked up big time.|d1ygwom|2465
"I hate myself more than ever.'"""|d1ygwom|2466
My boyfriend told me what a selfish asshole I was being and to grow up.|d1ygwom|2467
So much shame and guilt and I cannot even quantify it.|d1ygwom|2468
"[BK][BK]The next day he was angry because I was not properly '""over it.'"""|d1ygwom|2469
"Though I am still not sure what that means - I guess because I am still depressed?"""|d1ygwom|2470
Had everything planned out.|d1yguoj|2471
Went for it with a foolproof method that would drift me away forever.|d1yguoj|2472
Heard something I should not have heard, which scared me more than what I was trying to do (no, it was not a person or anything creepy, just something I had believed I had taken care of).|d1yguoj|2473
"So I said, 'Dammit, maybe I need help'"" and got help."|d1yguoj|2474
[BK][BK]Spent overnight in the hospital, a few days at an institute, and off my merry way to therapy and meds.|d1yguoj|2475
[BK][BK]No one close to me knows.|d1yguoj|2476
"Sorta vague on purpose."""|d1yguoj|2477
There were a lot of problems in my home.|d1ybpl7|2478
I was 15.|d1ybpl7|2479
I took a handful of Benadryl.|d1ybpl7|2480
I started falling asleep and thought, ''This is not so bad.|d1ybpl7|2481
''[BK][BK][BK]When I woke up, I was dizzy and I had a hard time focusing.|d1ybpl7|2482
Part of me was relieved that I would woken up, but another part was sad that I would still have to deal with my life.|d1ybpl7|2483
I cannot remember the context, but my parents told me that if someone told a therapist that they had suicidal thoughts, their life would basically be over, it would be on every personal record for the rest of their life.|d1ybpl7|2484
It really scared me from getting any kind of professional help.|d1ybpl7|2485
Home life did not get better, I just learned to manage my emotions so I would not be driven that far again (mostly getting out more).|d1ybpl7|2486
[BK][BK][BK]I have only told two people I did this, both were SOs.|d1ybpl7|2487
"The first one told me during an argument, 'Maybe my life would have been better if you tried again.'"""|d1ybpl7|2488
The second one is really protective of me and keeps a close watch of any kind of pharmaceuticals I get, I can understand.|d1ybpl7|2489
[BK][BK][BK]My life is much better now, though there are still times when I can feel the tingle to do it again.|d1ybpl7|2490
I worry some times how easily that part of me gets triggered, but the thought passes quickly.|d1ybpl7|2491
"Usually I think of all the things I still want to do, sometimes it is as simple as wanting to have dinner with my SO that night, and the bad thoughts go away."""|d1ybpl7|2492
Being a paramedic, I find it difficult to say the right things to people that have tried to hurt themselves.|d1ybowi|2493
I never know if I am helping by talking to them or making things worse.|d1ybowi|2494
I try to not come across as judgemental and I am probably saying things they hear all of the time from others.|d1ybowi|2495
"I try not to approach suicide attempts as a 'cry for help'"", or try to be their savior."|d1ybowi|2496
Most do not offer up a lot of info and I do not want to seem cold by just doing my job.|d1ybowi|2497
I can only hope that they realize that there are caring people out there that really are trying to help, but just do not know how to approach the situation without making it worse.|d1ybowi|2498
[BK]I will admit I suffer from depression and have currently started taking medication to help battle it.|d1ybowi|2499
I know how I would commit suicide, but I also do not think I could go through with it.|d1ybowi|2500
The comments here have helped me look at this from many different perspectives, especially the ripple effects on family and friends.|d1ybowi|2501
I could not imagine what my suicide would do to our son.|d1ybowi|2502
I know I would be screwed up for life if my dad killed himself.|d1ybowi|2503
"[BK][BK]Stay safe!"""|d1ybowi|2504
It took about a week before I finally realised that it had not worked.|d1ybiid|2505
[BK][BK]I would taken a few packets of Paracetamol on Friday afternoon.|d1ybiid|2506
That weekend we were due to visit my family, so figured I would become very ill at some point during the weekend and then be hospitalised before dying with friends and family around me.|d1ybiid|2507
[BK][BK]Fell asleep on the afternoon and could manage to carry on driving, so asked my wife to take over.|d1ybiid|2508
We had to stop so I could throw up.|d1ybiid|2509
Wasn't much vomit, and was 6 hours+ since I would taken the pills so still thought I would done enough.|d1ybiid|2510
[BK][BK]At this point I debated telling my wife, but decided to stick with my plans and I wanted to die somewhere familiar.|d1ybiid|2511
[BK][BK]Spent the the weekend enjoying every moment.|d1ybiid|2512
I would sit there with an odd smile on face as I watched my daughter play with grand parents and cousins.|d1ybiid|2513
This was probably the last time I would see these people happy like this.|d1ybiid|2514
It was beautiful.|d1ybiid|2515
Any moment I was ready and prepared for my liver to start giving out (the expected consequence of the OD) and then I knew that the end would come.|d1ybiid|2516
[BK][BK]Then the weekend was over and we went home.|d1ybiid|2517
Still I thought it might happen.|d1ybiid|2518
My wife went back to work.|d1ybiid|2519
Life carried on, as it does.|d1ybiid|2520
[BK][BK]It's at this point I told my wife what I had done, and what I had expected to happen.|d1ybiid|2521
Lots of crying from both of us.|d1ybiid|2522
Promises made to seek help.|d1ybiid|2523
We would get through this we told each other.|d1ybiid|2524
[BK][BK]After time, I knew that I could not leave my daughter - who was only 2 at the time, and would probably spend a good part of her life trying to understand why her daddy would rather die than be with her.|d1ybiid|2525
It would be unthinkable.|d1ybiid|2526
[BK][BK]I have gotten better; not perfect, though who is?|d1ybiid|2527
[BK][BK]The hardest part for me now is that weekend is still one of the happiest memories I have.|d1ybiid|2528
"So....my first thought was 'Which time?'"""|d1ybiog|2529
Unlike most everyone else here, I was never hospitalized, and I did not get super close to dying?|d1ybiog|2530
I do not know how to word it, exactly.|d1ybiog|2531
I do not know if you had call me a survivor, as I basically sucked at trying to die, for all my efforts.|d1ybiog|2532
My Mom also cared more about her sex life, her friends, and her pot than whether or not I was trying to take myself out so even when I should have been hospitalized, I never was.|d1ybiog|2533
[BK][BK]I did get feint from blood loss a few times and once of my overdose attempts knocked me out for a few hours the way Nyquil might, but that was it.|d1ybiog|2534
"[BK][BK]Honestly, I would say every time, even the stupid shit I did recently when I lapsed after *eleven years without an attempt* (sigh), it was always a variation on '""What the fuck was I thinking?"|d1ybiog|2535
"I should have done (*insert whatever here*), instead.'"""|d1ybiog|2536
"'""I am so godamn stupid.'"""|d1ybiog|2537
"'""I am so godamned worthless, I cannot even die right.'"""|d1ybiog|2538
"[BK][BK]I wish I could say it was something profound and life changing like '""Oh thank God,'"" or '""I got a second chance,'"" or something like that, but the reality is that it is not that simple for most of us."|d1ybiog|2539
Most of us either have a mental illness, severe trauma, or grew up in a shitty environment, or a combination of all of those (*waves* Hi, hello, right here).|d1ybiog|2540
And it takes a lot more than managing to survive to help most of us crawl out from under that shit.|d1ybiog|2541
"[BK][BK]There''s so much I could say on this topic in terms of my mental health and state and how so many of us struggle for most of our lives, but those are answers to questions that were not asked. """|d1ybiog|2542
The first time I gave it a real go was by overdose.|d1yc6c6|2543
It was not very well planned.|d1yc6c6|2544
I would been thinking about it for a while and finally confided in a close friend, who encouraged me to kill myself because if I was that depressed I might as well, and my friends did not like me anyway.|d1yc6c6|2545
So I took whatever I could get my hands on - I know it was mostly my sleeping pills but I do not remember how many or what else was mixed in there.|d1yc6c6|2546
[BK][BK]Obviously it was not enough.|d1yc6c6|2547
I woke up feeling like shit.|d1yc6c6|2548
I really wanted to die, both because I was depressed as hell and because I wanted to make that friend feel bad for being a dick about it.|d1yc6c6|2549
So I woke up feeling confused and stupid and wishing I would thought it through better.|d1yc6c6|2550
I drifted in and out of consciousness on the way to the hospital, and while I was there I just felt bad that I would interrupted my parents' day for this.|d1yc6c6|2551
[BK][BK]I did not regret trying but I regretted failing.|d1yc6c6|2552
I still wish I would got it right that time because now I am too scared to try it unless I know that it will definitely work.|d1yc6c6|2553
"I took an overdose of a beta blocker (massive OD of Propranolol) my housemates had driven me to it, and when they found out, one accused me of faking, the other said 'Well, he clearly wants to die, so let him.'"""|d1yjbcz|2554
Eventually they realised I was not fucking around they called an ambulance.|d1yjbcz|2555
[BK]After being taken to hospital and examined, a nurse approached me saying the phone had been ringing off the hook, it was my grandma, my mum and my sister, the first thought I had that was coherent was how much I would have missed out on and that despite the way my brain was currently working, people did in fact care about me... a lot.|d1yjbcz|2556
"My sister drove down half the country to come pick me up and made me live with her, now I am in university and thankful every day that I am alive that I did not succeed."""|d1yjbcz|2557
I joined Reddit just to answer this; I read threads every once in awhile, but know little about the ins and outs so patience for the newbie...[BK][BK]My first moment awake was total shock.|d34ult2|2558
Then deep, raging anger.|d34ult2|2559
After consuming close to 500 sleeping pills, I awoke in the ICU extremely confused and disoriented.|d34ult2|2560
I remember making my hands into fists and trying to touch them together but my arms would not work!|d34ult2|2561
I was with it enough to realize 'omg!|d34ult2|2562
"My arms will not work!'"""|d34ult2|2563
but out of it enough to not realize that my arms were restrained.|d34ult2|2564
I was in and out of consciousness off and on those 3 days in the ICU, but always felt this rage, like I wanted to get the hell out of there.|d34ult2|2565
I tried to rip out my own catheter and felt nothing <---- this makes me nauseous to even really ponder today.|d34ult2|2566
"[BK][BK]I will never forget the moment I told a nurse '"" I want to get out of here!"|d34ult2|2567
"When can I go smoke a cigarette?!'""."|d34ult2|2568
Her answer made my blood run cold.|d34ult2|2569
"'""You are not going anywhere; you tried to kill yourself."|d34ult2|2570
"You''ll be admitted upstairs to the psych ward...voluntarily or not.'"""|d34ult2|2571
Que rage, helplessness...|d34ult2|2572
Pure torment :''(  One of the scariest, most out of control moments of my life.|d34ult2|2573
I was so upset.|d34ult2|2574
I never meant to be around for any consequences.|d34ult2|2575
It was not a cry for help.|d34ult2|2576
I was done, my soul literally could not bare anymore pain.|d34ult2|2577
I am normally a sentimental schmuck...but I did not leave a note, never said a goodbye, I simply drove around town buying pills, my tear stained face turned to a brave mask, and checked myself into a hotel to end my life.|d34ult2|2578
[BK][BK]My mom and my aunt came in to talk to me after that nurse left.|d34ult2|2579
I literally have no memory of what they said.|d34ult2|2580
I was still very out of it from all the drugs and maybe from the seizure I had?|d34ult2|2581
But what I DO remember is after that talk, something in my brain clicked.|d34ult2|2582
Something in my soul vibrated again.|d34ult2|2583
And as I rode the elevator to psych ward, I surrender all.|d34ult2|2584
It was my rock bottom...and it freed me to move forward.|d34ult2|2585
[BK][BK]My heart is with all of you who have suffered and found a way to claw yourself out of rock bottom.|d34ult2|2586
You''re all heroes.|d34ult2|2587
I am too.|d34ult2|2588
"And I finally believe that <3[BK][BK]"""|d34ult2|2589
I know I am late but I could really need some advice here.|d1yc8k6|2590
[BK](also this is a throawaway for obvious reasons)[BK][BK]My girlfriend attempted suicide after her first boyfriend treated her like shit when she was 15 years old (she is now 18) and she was not messing around.|d1yc8k6|2591
She took like 20-25 sleeping pills and went to bed expecting to never wake up again.|d1yc8k6|2592
[BK]Instead she woke up in the hospital and was told her parents brought her there after they heard her vomiting in her room, which she cannot even remember at all.|d1yc8k6|2593
[BK][BK]I met her last year and she told me about this about half a year ago.|d1yc8k6|2594
I have a troubled past too and was close to do something along those lines myself but, thankfully, never actually was strong enough to do it.|d1yc8k6|2595
[BK][BK]We both regret our suicidal thoughts / actions of our past but now we are really happy together and very thankful to be alive.|d1yc8k6|2596
[BK][BK]Now comes the part I could need advice on from people with similar experiences: Her parents started being afraid of it happening again and she felt really controlled, being watched all the time.|d1yc8k6|2597
"Which...i can understand somewhat from her parents point of view, but still it makes her feel quite miserable at times when 'the walls have ears'""."|d1yc8k6|2598
She wants to leave home as soon as possible but since she will be at university for at least another 4-5 years with only a small part time job on the side it wont be as easy to support living on her own without her parents support.|d1yc8k6|2599
And she hates being dependent on them.|d1yc8k6|2600
"[BK][BK]The thing is...I actually feel like most of this supposed '""control'"" of her parents is just in her head and based on guilt because of her suicide attempt."|d1yc8k6|2601
The first few months she told me she could not stay overnight because her parents would not allow it.|d1yc8k6|2602
But she never even asked them in the first place.|d1yc8k6|2603
"And when she did they said: '""Sure go ahead'""[BK][BK]There were several of these moments where I got the feeling she is paranoid about her parents."|d1yc8k6|2604
I guess they did get freaked out by her attempt and tried to keep her safe, but now they are quite relaxed again and she does not see it.|d1yc8k6|2605
[BK]I get along fine with her parents but I do not really wanna bring this topic up with them.|d1yc8k6|2606

My first thought was sadness because I was still here also no one had noticed.|d1yktqa|2622
I felt really alone.|d1yktqa|2623
[BK][BK]I got help and slowly started feeling better.|d1yktqa|2624
I have my ups and downs but fortunately I have not been that bad again.|d1yktqa|2625
I had to also learn to not rely on other people for my happiness.|d1yktqa|2626
I was was buying supplies, Gorilla tape and big, very thick garbage bags.|d1yct3s|2627
The plan was to wrap myself in one layer and then wrap a second one within it, in a shower, in the dark.|d1yct3s|2628
Just remove a sensation at a time, let the shower keep the bag temperature comfortable, as I run out of air.|d1yct3s|2629
Ultimately I did not do it and checked myself into a facility.|d1yct3s|2630
I felt so weak.|d1yct3s|2631
It was an incredibly dumb way to do it with plenty of points of failure.|d1yct3s|2632
It was melodramatic.|d1yct3s|2633

All the cliches and pills thrown my way never changed that.|d1yct3s|2635
[BK][BK]And the facility was terrible.|d1yct3s|2636
They basically isolate you from the real world with nothing to do.|d1yct3s|2637
There's no stimulation at all.|d1yct3s|2638
The intake nurse is a fucking bouncer, and the only reading material these fuckers had was a bible.|d1yct3s|2639
Hardly a comforting scenario.|d1yct3s|2640
I felt even more trapped.|d1yct3s|2641
I had 10 minutes left in my shift before I was going to drive to the Golden Gate Bridge to jump.|d1ydh80|2642
I had become so exhausted from life that the thought of dying became a pleasant idea.|d1ydh80|2643
It got to the point to where it was all I thought about.|d1ydh80|2644
My senior manager had noticed how depressed I had become over the previous months and decided to take me aside and ask what was going on.|d1ydh80|2645
She must have known or had a hunch because she was not letting me go until she heard my plans for the day.|d1ydh80|2646
After I confessed, she drove me to the nearest hospital to stay for the night.|d1ydh80|2647

[BK][BK]It is a hell of a road but it gets better.|d1yepyd|2662
Don''t give up and kill yourself, not yet.|d1yepyd|2663
Give yourself a few months and promise yourself that you will at least try until then.|d1yepyd|2664

I had locked myself in my room for so long and had found pleasure in nothing.|d1yepyd|2667
Nothing big or small could sway how horrible I felt and how much of a chore it was just to go through the motions.|d1yepyd|2668

What I was really doing was suppressing my negative feelings which prevailed anyway.|d1yenxn|2692
I started crying hard and felt really low.|d1yenxn|2693
It felt like there was something deeply wrong with me and that i was alone.|d1yenxn|2694
[BK][BK]Then a really silly idea came to me.|d1yenxn|2695
I decided to go to my dresser and pull out this stuffed bunny that I used to adore when I was a kid.|d1yenxn|2696
(I should mention that I am in my 20s and male.)|d1yenxn|2697
I have not thought about this thing since I was somewhere between 5 and 10[BK][BK]Anyway, I slept with my stuffed bunny last night and did childish things like hug it, rub noses with it, and just lay there staring into its eyes.|d1yenxn|2698
The therapeutic effect this had on me was enormous and kind of unexpected.|d1yenxn|2699
After just a few minutes, I felt this amazing sense of security and that everything was going to be alright.|d1yenxn|2700
This is not something I feel like I could have done with any living thing I know.|d1yenxn|2701
[BK][BK]At first I just laid there staring at it and just cried.|d1yenxn|2702
Except this was not a bitter cry.|d1yenxn|2703
It felt more like a release.|d1yenxn|2704
It was as if this bunny was absorbing and deleting all negative feelings I was having.|d1yenxn|2705
After that, I felt that sad-happy feeling like in the movie Inside Out.|d1yenxn|2706
It felt like this bunny was really alive and had a soul and understood me.|d1yenxn|2707
Whether or not this is actually true is completely irrelevant at this point.|d1yenxn|2708
The feeling was real, and that is what mattered.|d1yenxn|2709
"I brought myself to tell the bunny out loud things like 'thank you'"" and '""I love you'""."|d1yenxn|2710
[BK][BK]This was a powerful moment for me that I am glad I had.|d1yenxn|2711
The reason I am saying all this here is because it might help you guys immensely to find a way to get in touch with the good parts of your inner child.|d1yenxn|2712
Also, do not underestimate the importance of social bonding as it is a basic human _need_, not just a nice thing to have.|d1yenxn|2713
"[BK][BK]Edit: changed '""positive living things'"" to '""positive things'""."|d1yenxn|2714
"Thanks phone..."""|d1yenxn|2715
I do not know of if this is against the rules to post,  but I am doing it anyways.|d1yerg1|2716
I just want to say thankyou to everyone who has posted.|d1yerg1|2717
I have just finished my first round of therapy after having depression for a long long time,  and every time I would have to fill out a form.|d1yerg1|2718
It basically asked on a scale of one to ten how you feel,  what you feel able to do and all that jazz.|d1yerg1|2719
The last question was if you have ever had suicidal thoughts,  why have not you attempted suicide this week?|d1yerg1|2720
I could never really think of an answer.|d1yerg1|2721
Looking through a lot of these posts I have now found an answer.|d1yerg1|2722
Although I have had and continue to have suicidal thoughts,  they are fleeting.|d1yerg1|2723
They may last for around half an hour,  but they are moments,  nothing more.|d1yerg1|2724
So thank you everyone for posting in here.|d1yerg1|2725
It's really helped me realize that just because I feel like that sometimes,  it will pass,  and I will continue.|d1yerg1|2726
The first time, I tried to hang myself with a length of chain, which slipped and pinched my neck--the pain of that was worse than dying, apparently.|d1yf00e|2727
It shocked me into survival mode, I lifted myself up and breathed.|d1yf00e|2728
After that, I heard my dad talking upstairs, and I panicked to get the thing off.|d1yf00e|2729
[BK][BK]'I cannot even hang myself right.|d1yf00e|2730
What a failure.|d1yf00e|2731
"'""[BK][BK]I cried for about an hour."|d1yf00e|2732
Dad still does not know.|d1yf00e|2733
[BK][BK]The second time, I was going to shoot myself.|d1yf00e|2734
I am not sure if it really counts as an attempt because I never pulled the trigger, but I had the barrel of a loaded 30.06 in my mouth, and I had written my note.|d1yf00e|2735
I started thinking about who would find me--it would probably be my dad, my mom, or one of my brothers.|d1yf00e|2736
My sisters would have been at school.|d1yf00e|2737
I started thinking about that, and the thing that drove me off it was that Mom would be cleaning up her baby''s brain off the wall.|d1yf00e|2738
I could not handle that, so I took it out of my mouth, ejected the round, and hid the bolt someplace.|d1yf00e|2739
Still have not found it, to this day--I think I blocked it out or something.|d1yf00e|2740
"But this is what I thought, then:[BK][BK]'""They can never know, and these bullets are not allowed in my room anymore."|d1yf00e|2741
"'""[BK][BK][BK]My older brother knows I have attempted, but no one else in my family does."|d1yf00e|2742
A few close friends, too.|d1yf00e|2743
[BK][BK]Edit: Just because someone''s funny, seems laid-back and lighthearted, and smiles all the time, it does not mean that they are happy.|d1yf00e|2744
It does not mean they are not struggling with their demons.|d1yf00e|2745
Both of my attempts were partially vengeful acts against my parents.|d1yf00e|2746
I was really messed up during those times in my life, and nobody would have guessed that I was suicidal, but I was.|d1yf00e|2747
[BK][BK]Don''t ever be afraid to ask someone how they are really doing.|d1yf00e|2748
"If I would had that chance to be honest, I could have avoided some horrible things."""|d1yf00e|2749
I was so mad I was still alive.|d1y6ysb|2750
I still am.|d1y6ysb|2751
I would have cried but my body was too dehydrated.|d1y6ysb|2752
It completely hollowed me out emotionally I am dead inside.|d1y6ysb|2753
I am just waiting to die now so i do not hurt anyone.|d1y6ysb|2754
I still remember the anger of realizing i was conscious.|d1y6ysb|2755
Sometimes when I wake up i get the same feeling knowing I am still here.|d1y6ysb|2756
Outwardly my life is together now, it is been a few years and I have achieved a lot but its always for someone else's sake.|d1y6ysb|2757
So yeah anger|d1y6ysb|2758
I dunno if I am a suicide survivor really.|d1y8wlu|2759
But [this](https://medium.com/@PurpleBooth/tuesday-night-wednesday-morning-6727c2c9981d#.1kelmkh2g) happened last week.|d1y8wlu|2760
[BK][BK]Basically I was going to jump off a bridge but the Samaritans talked me into not doing it from a payphone, half way through I ran out of money, but they gave me the free to call from payphones number like a second before the money ran out and I talked to a second person.|d1y8wlu|2761
I had already been at A&E that night and escaped, and all I could think about was if the person who I talked to first knew that it had turned out okay and they had saved my life or if they were worried about me and it was stressing them out.|d1y8wlu|2762
[BK][BK]I guess I am not really a survivor because they talked me down before I actually did it.|d1y8wlu|2763
I tried to cut my wrists twice as hard as I could.|d1yf6cw|2764
I do not know why, but that knife could pierce my skin.|d1yf6cw|2765
I threw the knife down on the ground crying because I realized what had occurred.|d1yf6cw|2766
It's like I knew it was not answer but I still thought it would solve all my problems.|d1yf6cw|2767
It was life changing.|d1yf6cw|2768
My dad will not convince himself I tried to do.|d1yf6cw|2769
But it is who I am and what has defined me.|d1yf6cw|2770
I am me.|d1yf6cw|2771
Please, if there is no one out there to talk to, talk to me.|d1yf6cw|2772
It is not worth it at all.|d1yf6cw|2773
[BK][BK]I am so happy I am alive today and I actually run my own clothing company dedicated to self health and positive self esteem.|d1yf6cw|2774
Shameless plug to it, but www.happyoutfitters.net[BK][BK]I am trying to create a more national recognition.|d1yf6cw|2775
Suicide and depression needs to be talked about more.|d1yf6cw|2776
I do not want anyone to ever be there, no one needs to take their own life.|d1yf6cw|2777
The world is beautiful and there is just so much to see and so much to experience.|d1yf6cw|2778
I tried to drink myself to death.|d1yf71o|2779
I know it is a shitty way to do it but for an alcoholic it seemed fitting.|d1yf71o|2780
I woke up in my suit on the couch the next day still drunk at 5pm feeling like shit and confused.|d1yf71o|2781
I realized I was alive and that it was a terrible idea.|d1yf71o|2782
I checked my phone and say that lots of friends were both concerned and giving me shit for getting that drunk.|d1yf71o|2783
So i had people that cared about me.|d1yf71o|2784
I went back to bed and slept till the next day and finally had the worst hangover of my life two days later.|d1yf71o|2785
I have never been that low again.|d1yf71o|2786
I tested and swung on the rope, then I hung myself from a tree in my back yard.|d1yfiyr|2787
I woke up at the bottom of the hill with the rope tightly around my neck, gasping for breath.|d1yfiyr|2788
The knot that I tied was stuck, and closing my airway.|d1yfiyr|2789
[BK][BK]The first thing I did was go inside, to my mother, and point to the rope around my neck.|d1yfiyr|2790
I could not breath, and was blacking-out with stars flashing all around me.|d1yfiyr|2791
Apparently my neck was bloody too.|d1yfiyr|2792
[BK][BK]I was numb.|d1yfiyr|2793
My mother told me that I would be going to a clinic, and I just shrugged.|d1yfiyr|2794
The next day, and for four months I was at a clinic.|d1yfiyr|2795
I passed through a lot of pain and anger there.|d1yfiyr|2796
[BK][BK]When I joined school again (6th grade), I was completely empty.|d1yfiyr|2797
-Like I had just started life again.|d1yfiyr|2798
It was bumpy, but I had the skills to cope, and grow.|d1yfiyr|2799
I threw up a whole lot and I was not really thinking about anything except for how physically badly I felt.|d1y40lh|2800
After I was done throwing up I cried for about a solid hour.|d1y40lh|2801
There were not really many solid thoughts in my head it was mostly a manic rush of really miserable and really angry things.|d1y40lh|2802
I calmed down and then I did not really feel or think anything.|d1y40lh|2803
It was this weird kind of calm where it was like I went on auto pilot.|d1y40lh|2804
"I do not think I ever hit a point where I thought about whether I was glad it had not worked or not, it always just felt like 'well that just did not happen.'"""|d1y40lh|2805

"(After 5 attempts across 6 months)[BK]'Why the hell am I doing this, I think I am just being selfish if I leave everyone who loves me behind'""[BK][BK]And yet without attempting in the first place I would not have changed for the better."""|d1y6vx2|2807
I would suggest watching A long way down.|d1zr3pt|2808
Great movie related to this topic.|d1zr3pt|2809
I am not looking for sympathy and honestly, I am kind of pissed that it did not work.|d1ygk1d|2810
[BK][BK]I tried to overdose on Depakote.|d1ygk1d|2811
Like, a lot.|d1ygk1d|2812
Around half of a 90ct bottle of 750mg tablets, which I was taking because I am also an epileptic.|d1ygk1d|2813
Anyways, my mom found me in the garage after my ex told her he was worried about me.|d1ygk1d|2814
It had already been awhile since I took them, and I told the nurses at the ER that I had taken like, ten instead of the actual forty to sixty pills that were in my system.|d1ygk1d|2815
So they did not pump my stomach and they took their sweet damn time transferring me to another hospital.|d1ygk1d|2816
Suited me just fine.|d1ygk1d|2817
[BK][BK]Long story short, I spent the entire night throwing up black vomit and like, possibly hallucinating.|d1ygk1d|2818
The nurses tried to carry me to the bathroom to help me throw up, but I did not make it and I got vomit all over my gown.|d1ygk1d|2819
This was like, three in the morning.|d1ygk1d|2820
A quick blood analysis showed that I was like, dead.|d1ygk1d|2821
Going to die, *definitely*.|d1ygk1d|2822
The doctor was called in from his house, and they asked my mom to come to the hospital.|d1ygk1d|2823
[BK][BK]The vomit was coming out of my nose.|d1ygk1d|2824
I really thought I was going to do it.|d1ygk1d|2825
I thought I was going to succeed.|d1ygk1d|2826
[BK][BK]I woke up at midnight two days later with a Jamaican nurse sitting in my room.|d1ygk1d|2827
I started crying and she sang to me to calm me down, and held me in her arms.|d1ygk1d|2828
[BK][BK]All I could think was that I wanted to go home.|d1ygk1d|2829
"1st thought: 'Ew I am lying in a pool of vomit'"" [BK][BK]2nd thought: '""why are my arms burned?"|d1ygmbr|2830
"'""[BK][BK]3rd though: '""I am going to flunk that paper due today'""[BK][BK]Shitty OD attempt while manic, had not slept for 3 days and was fucked up on klonopin."|d1ygmbr|2831
Self-harmed a bunch and then downed a few bottles of pills with liquor.|d1ygmbr|2832
[BK][BK]Turns out my shitty suicide research saved my life; the two drugs I had taken the most of nullified each others'' effects on my heart.|d1ygmbr|2833
Only lasting effects from the whole episode are the burn scars still faintly visible on my arm.|d1ygmbr|2834
[BK][BK]Professor was cool as fuck and gave me extra time on the paper.|d1ygmbr|2835
"Got help from mental health people soon after and life has for the most part been marginally better since."""|d1ygmbr|2836
"After the first attempt, my first thought when I woke up in the hospital was, 'Shit, I need to try again.'"""|d1y4p7i|2837
Got home two days later.|d1y4p7i|2838
"After the second attempt, my first thought was, '""I am a fucking failure.'"""|d1y4p7i|2839
"One failed suicide attempt feels shitty, but a second failed attempt feels even worse. """|d1y4p7i|2840
I did not lose consciousness.|d1y4oe1|2841
I do not really remember the immediate aftermath very well.|d1y4oe1|2842
I sort of remember being taken to the hospital and wondering what the big deal was, but I think that might be a false memory.|d1y4oe1|2843
[BK][BK]The first memory I am confident of is sitting on a hospital bed in the ER being told that I could either be willingly admitted the the juvenile psychiatric ward, or I could waste hours of everyone's time and be marched up there by an armed police officer.|d1y4oe1|2844
I am pretty sure all I felt at the time was frustration, mostly about how big a deal everyone was making about it.|d1y4oe1|2845
[BK][BK]I am better now.|d1y4oe1|2846
I cannot honestly say I am a functional human being, but after ten years or so I have grown up quite a bit.|d1y4oe1|2847
Why is the 'easy way' so fucking hard?|d1y4t7v|2848
[BK][BK]The last time I tried I was intent on hanging myself(emulating Robin I think) so I fashioned a noose and put the end of it over the door and closed it.|d1y4t7v|2849
Wrapped the noose around my neck and just let my legs go limp.|d1y4t7v|2850
I passed out then my body just stood up all on its own.|d1y4t7v|2851
I woke up standing and mildly choking.|d1y4t7v|2852
after months (years?)|d1y7tcu|2853
of lurking, I finally created an account just to answer this one (english is not my native language and now I am also pretty tired so I will not consider myself responsible for grammatical atrocities...)[BK][BK]26yo here.|d1y7tcu|2854
[BK]well...a little bit more than a year ago, I think it was mid-february (2015), I tried to hang myself at home.|d1y7tcu|2855
It was a tough time both for me and for my family, and I had decided to come back home some months before to try and fix things, or so I thought.|d1y7tcu|2856
[BK]needless to say, I did not manage to fix shit, and everything went all downward spiral on me and my parents (and brother and sister).|d1y7tcu|2857
[BK]so, one night of mid-february, I had enough.|d1y7tcu|2858
enough of bad luck, enough of things always going downhill, enough of myself and my stupid inability to solve problems.|d1y7tcu|2859
[BK]years before, with my father, we had built a home gym in a empty room, it was fun and a great father-son experience.|d1y7tcu|2860
the gym had basically everything: a bench, squat stands, a barbell, three pairs of dumbbells, a jumping rope, a friggin' homemade punching bag!|d1y7tcu|2861
and of course, there was a pullup-bar mounted on the ceiling.|d1y7tcu|2862
[BK]now you can see where the story's going.|d1y7tcu|2863
I sat on the bench, took the jumping rope, set up a slipknot on the pullup-bar, stepped on the bench, arranged the noose around my neck, and put my feet off the bench.|d1y7tcu|2864
[BK]one second, two second, X seconds.|d1y7tcu|2865
I do not remember exactly.|d1y7tcu|2866
[BK]it started to feel tight and I could not breath.|d1y7tcu|2867
[BK]instinctively, my hands gripped the rope.|d1y7tcu|2868
there is one particular feeling I will always remember:[BK]the fabric of the rope.|d1y7tcu|2869
[BK]it was so strong, so real, so intricate, so beautiful.|d1y7tcu|2870
there was a lot of work behind it, for sure.|d1y7tcu|2871
so much marvellous complex simplicity and simple complexity at the same time.|d1y7tcu|2872
I was able to feel it, finally I was able to feel *something*, after months and months of nothing.|d1y7tcu|2873
[BK]and it hit me.|d1y7tcu|2874
[BK]I do not know exactly what hit me, but it did.|d1y7tcu|2875
[BK]maybe the realization that it was a shame to waste a life in such a useless and pointless way, the realization that if the fabric of the rope was so beautiful, what could be said about a human being, the very expression of nature's (and maybe the entire universe's) fathomless power?|d1y7tcu|2876
[BK]I kicked my feet back and forth, and I was able to step on the bench again.|d1y7tcu|2877
I untied the knot, took a looooong breath, the longest of my whole life.|d1y7tcu|2878
I stepped off the bench again and sat on a chair.|d1y7tcu|2879
[BK]and...I started laughing.|d1y7tcu|2880
like goddamn fucking crazy.|d1y7tcu|2881
like the Joker himself.|d1y7tcu|2882
I could not help it.|d1y7tcu|2883
at all.|d1y7tcu|2884
I think I laughed for 10 minutes straight, or maybe more.|d1y7tcu|2885
then I fell asleep on the chair, and the sun woke me up at dawn.|d1y7tcu|2886
[BK]so that is it.|d1y7tcu|2887
I never said anything to my parents, even though in the following months I told the story to pretty much everyone I know, because I felt the compulsive need to share it to get it off my chest.|d1y7tcu|2888
[BK]I am not sure if this qualifies as an answer to your question, since the conscious thought happened before and not after my suicide attempt.|d1y7tcu|2889
[BK]but yeah...I always wanted to share it with some strangers on the internet, and maybe now it was the right time to do it, I do not know.|d1y7tcu|2890
[BK]now my life is better, in the end I sort of managed to solve my family's problems, even though it pretty much drained my mind and I had to stop my academic career for a while.|d1y7tcu|2891
[BK]I plan to resume it in the future, next year, or maybe not.|d1y7tcu|2892
[BK]but I feel fine, all things considered I managed to keep fighting pretty well after that episode, and most importantly, I am still here.|d1y7tcu|2893
[BK]never stop fighting, no matter the shit your life throws at you.|d1y7tcu|2894
[BK]never yield to circumstances.|d1y7tcu|2895
NEVER surrender.|d1y7tcu|2896
[BK]peace to you all.|d1y7tcu|2897
I was sad.|d1ygnnz|2898
I did not want to wake up.|d1ygnnz|2899
I was just so tired of feeling, I wanted to lay down and just drift off.|d1ygnnz|2900
I suppose I woke up and threw up a lot, I remember my friend coming by with food and coffee, but I was just sad.|d1ygnnz|2901
I am still in a very bad place.|d1ygnnz|2902
Unneeded.|d1ygnnz|2903
But I do not think I will ever have the courage to try it again.|d1ygnnz|2904
I just wish it could have worked.|d1ygnnz|2905
Of course I could not do it right, again.|d1ygo8l|2906
Got to go farther next time, stop being a coward.|d1ygo8l|2907
For me it was confusion.|d1ygo93|2908
And the need to breathe.|d1ygo93|2909
I was exhaling the contents of my stomach at the time.|d1ygo93|2910
The pure primal panic took hold and I was just spewing tablets everywhere.|d1ygo93|2911
Then I passed out for a bit, then I woke up covered in puke.|d1ygo93|2912
[BK][BK]Then I crawled back into the house ( I went to the shed to do the deed) and crawled into bed.|d1ygo93|2913
No one really seemed to notice anything had happened, my house mates just thought I was sick and I was FUCKING sick for about 4 days.|d1ygo93|2914
At first I wondered if I was still going to die because it felt that bad, and then as I got better I just decided that taking a cocktail of all the pharmaceuticals you can find is a stupid way to try and off yourself so I put the decision off until I could find a better way.|d1ygo93|2915
[BK][BK]And then I never did.|d1ygo93|2916
[BK][BK]If my house mates every suspected anything they never said or did anything about it.|d1ygo93|2917
I took a bunch of whatever I could find.|d1y52i5|2918
Tylenol, aleve maybe benadryl but I do not really remember.|d1y52i5|2919
It kind of just happened automatically.|d1y52i5|2920
I was going to keep taking more and I realized my mother's birthday was the next day so I stopped l. I woke up and I had pain in my lower back.|d1y52i5|2921
I let it go for 2 or 3 days before I finally decided I should tell my someone.|d1y52i5|2922
I asked my mom if I could talk to her and I told her what I had tried to do.|d1y52i5|2923
I felt almost selfish for once I had realized the timing and that I had put people who loved me into that horrible position.|d1y52i5|2924
A very verbal sigh.|d1y4xz9|2925
[BK][BK]My depression was/is caused mainly by boredom.|d1y4xz9|2926
Although that does not really feel like the right word.|d1y4xz9|2927
[BK][BK]Nothing in the world whatsoever is stimulating.|d1y4xz9|2928
Like being in a perpetual state of complete uninterest.|d1y4xz9|2929
[BK][BK]Some days its depressing, others you just do not feel.|d1y4xz9|2930
[BK][BK]I did not try again.|d1y4xz9|2931
I do not see the benefit really.|d1y4xz9|2932
I felt very calm and actually a little happy.|d1y4tih|2933
Not because I lived, but because I saw my attempt out to the end and accepted death.|d1y4tih|2934
"I think my first actual thought was 'Am I dead?'"""|d1y4tih|2935
which is a question that I was not able to answer for awhile.|d1y4tih|2936
I felt so disconnected from the world that I felt there was a chance I was dead and it was just a lucid dream.|d1y4tih|2937
I have used the experience positively though.|d1y4tih|2938
I do not fear for my life in any situation and I will give up everything I own to help out anybody else who is suffering because I already gave up my life, my suffering does not matter anymore.|d1y4tih|2939
"I will always draw the short straw if the option is presented."""|d1y4tih|2940
Thinking about it, I usually went to get something to eat.|d1y4y0k|2941
Except that time with the pills, I just keep throwing up and laying there.|d1y4y0k|2942
I cannot wear shorts in public any more.|d1ygou4|2943
I was laying in the bath tub in my underwear, (I wanted to at least have those on when someone found me) and I was practically bathing in my own blood.|d1ygou4|2944
I remember thinking to myself how shitty it was going to be for my family to find me, and the next I remember is my mom coming into the bathroom, then pulling out her cell phone to call an ambulance.|d1ygou4|2945

Late to the party but oh well,[BK]I tried to overdose on a trip to Thailand last year.|d1ygp9j|2947
I got drunk on the room tab, went down to the street and bought some drugs from the shifty little pop-up stores that appear at night, and took them on my way back to the hotel, washed them down with vodka and a little mixer to make sure I would not throw up.|d1ygp9j|2948
I was feeling really emotional beforehand, as well as when I was back at the hotel wishing I could just die already, but actually planning it and going through with it was the most clarity I have ever experienced.|d1ygp9j|2949
I actually felt happy and excited that it was finally going to be over.|d1ygp9j|2950
I cut myself as well that evening, as well as writing to my best friend before I fell asleep.|d1ygp9j|2951
[BK]I woke up very late in the evening the next day, and just felt dread that I was still alive.|d1ygp9j|2952
The drugs had made me incredibly sleepy and my head felt so heavy I could barely move.|d1ygp9j|2953
I knew I now had to deal with the repercussions of what I would tried to do, how upset my friend was, and how the bloody sheets would be explained when I checked out.|d1ygp9j|2954
It was more of the fact that I felt frustrated that it would look like I was not serious, and that I had faked it like a teenage girl for attention.|d1ygp9j|2955
More and more things from the previous night started to come back to me, but all I wanted to do was just disappear still.|d1ygp9j|2956
I had wanted to die, not pointlessly upset and inconvenience everyone else.|d1ygp9j|2957
[BK][BK]Even now when things are finally better, the feelings and thoughts that led me to want to kill myself are still there, and I always wish I had died that night because then all the pain and suffering I will endure the rest of my life could have been avoided; the good parts are never really worth the bad parts.|d1ygp9j|2958
I have not wanted to kill myself since but I think that may be because I have not really been able to feel anything very strongly since; I am still sad, I am still happy, but never really passionately happy or devastated enough to try again yet.|d1ygp9j|2959

When my Aunt tried committing suicide, my mother (who has been a nurse most of her life) was so devastated seeing her older sister lying there dying that she went into shock and fell on the floor.|d1ygs44|2970
She screamed for my dad, but I am the one who came running.|d1ygs44|2971
I will never forget the tone of her voice when she screamed.|d1ygs44|2972
I revived her since I am the only one that knew CPR/first aid besides my mom, and I kept her alive until the paramedics came.|d1ygs44|2973
My mom stayed with her until she woke up, but I had to go to work.|d1ygs44|2974
"She said the first thing she did was start to cry, and my aunts first words were '(twoheartedgal) is really mad at me is not she'""."|d1ygs44|2975

My cousin succeeded in killing himself when we were teenagers (roughly 15 years ago).|d1yh8n9|2985
"I have always wondered if he instantly regretted it or not, especially since I know he probably had a few moments before he lost consciousness [Details (trigger warning)](/s 'He hung himself from a tree and basically strangled himself since it was not a snap-your-neck hanging; then taken off of life support after there was no brain activity detected after being in the hospital a few days'"")."|d1yh8n9|2986

The first time I tried to kill myself was ODing on pills.|d1ygu2z|2996
I went to bed hoping I would not wake up.|d1ygu2z|2997
When my mom woke me up in the morning I was confused and really sad.|d1ygu2z|2998
The next day at work (I work for my dad) and when I saw him I said hi and immediately went into the bathroom and cried I was 20.|d1ygu2z|2999
My dad has been working 14 hour days 6 days a week for one reason and one reason only.|d1ygu2z|3000
To support me and my mom.|d1ygu2z|3001
And realizing I tried to give up on him killed me on the inside.|d1ygu2z|3002
Through out the I cried atleast once an hour.|d1ygu2z|3003
Then I started thinking about my other relatives and my cousin at the time was only 8 and looks up to me like an older brother.|d1ygu2z|3004
I imagined my uncle at my funeral trying to explain to my cousin why I  did it and why I was dead.|d1ygu2z|3005
That hit me really hard.|d1ygu2z|3006
[BK][BK]A few years later I tried again.|d1ygu2z|3007
But this time on sleeping pills.|d1ygu2z|3008
I took 50 sleeping pills (2400mg).|d1ygu2z|3009
1200mg is considered extremely dangerous.|d1ygu2z|3010
And 50 pills was considered attempt suicide.|d1ygu2z|3011
So I took the pills and was on the brink of death and I knew it.|d1ygu2z|3012
I went almost completely blind.|d1ygu2z|3013
I could not see 2 feet in front of me and I could not walk more than 2 steps without collapsing to the ground.|d1ygu2z|3014
I could not see or feel anything.|d1ygu2z|3015
all I could hear was my dead weight body hitting the ground every time I fell.|d1ygu2z|3016
I managed to make it up the stairs and went to bed.|d1ygu2z|3017
I decided I am either going to wake up or not wake up.|d1ygu2z|3018
I went or bed.|d1ygu2z|3019
[BK][BK]I woke up and I was forever grateful to be alive.|d1ygu2z|3020
Ever since then I have been a much happier person I have not thought about suicide since and I used to think about it all the time|d1ygu2z|3021
Ahh fuck I cannot move.|d1y659y|3022
[BK][BK]I was in the hospital for about 2 weeks semi-comatose.|d1y659y|3023
I could hear everything, if they propped my eyes open I could see it, but I had no voluntary control over my muscles.|d1y659y|3024
I did not chose active suicide.|d1yeagr|3025

[BK][BK]I had a valid living will and a healthcare proxy on file at the hospital and with my personal physician.|d1yeagr|3030
The hospital knew about my living will and ignored it.|d1yeagr|3031
They did not misplace or overlook it.|d1yeagr|3032
Hospital records show that they reviewed it and did not act on it.|d1yeagr|3033

[BK][BK]The next like 2 or 3 days I was in the ICU having my blood sugar tested every half hour or hour or something, and getting injected with sugar and forced to eat sugar.|d1z7vuc|3206
It sucked and my fingers were bruised and squeezed dry by the end of it.|d1z7vuc|3207
There was a nurse there who was really nice to me though, that kindness really meant something to me, like maybe not all of humanity totally sucks.|d1z7vuc|3208
[BK][BK]I think they only took me out of the psych ward because they needed the bed for someone else.|d1z7vuc|3209
"[BK][BK]I am as lost as ever. """|d1z7vuc|3210
Wondering whether or not anyone would find out.|d1y6v8i|3211
I tried to slit my wrists in my dorm room but a friend walked in shortly after.|d1z7uof|3212
I was light headed and actually kinda giddy from blood loss but my first thought when I realized my friend was not going to let me bleed out was ' damn.|d1z7uof|3213
"Can''t even do this right '""."|d1z7uof|3214
It was much later in the evening after I got home that I realized that death , while still alluring, was not what I wanted.|d1z7uof|3215
I was still woefully depressed, so depressed that I honestly felt my family would not care if I died and I really had no desire for life but...as I looked at my bandaged wrist I did not feel like suicide was the right choice for me.|d1z7uof|3216
"Still battling depression 17 years later but I have never entertained the thought of suicide ever again. """|d1z7uof|3217
I tried twice and failed.|d1yjg3q|3218
I am 16, and I tried last year and the year before, both around september/october.|d1yjg3q|3219
I took every pill I could find, including tons of benadryl so I could pass out and never wake up.|d1yjg3q|3220
I sat in my bed, and started crying because I was so afraid...|d1yjg3q|3221
I told my parents and they took me to the ER and everything.|d1yjg3q|3222
I had to stay at the hospital for a couple of days.|d1yjg3q|3223
Those days were incredibly painful, not just because of the after effects of the pills metabolizing in my body.|d1yjg3q|3224
The next time I tried, I cut my legs fairly deep, and took even more pills than I had before.|d1yjg3q|3225
A year had passed since last time, and this time I took a whole bottle of Ibuprofen, sleeping pills, and every pill I could possibly find (again).|d1yjg3q|3226
I barely remember what even happened, except for when my parents were trying to put my limp body in the car, and police, and an ambulance.|d1yjg3q|3227
It's all kind of vague still.|d1yjg3q|3228
I woke up in the ER again, and then after that they put me in a psych ward for a week.|d1yjg3q|3229
It was torture in there.|d1yjg3q|3230
The worst feelings I have ever felt in my life were in a locked room, alone, in a corner, crying...|d1yjg3q|3231
I do not even like to think about it.|d1yjg3q|3232
Now I am here, on tons of antidepressants, and always being watched.|d1yjg3q|3233
Haven't finished a year of school in two years, and now I am trying to get my shit together, and figure out why I am on this earth, and what I should do.|d1yjg3q|3234
Well, shit, how am I gonna explain the puke everywhere?|d1y6wya|3235
I was 15 at the time, the week after I was in the psychiatric ward.|d1ykfda|3236
I turned 16 when I was  in there.|d1ykfda|3237
[BK][BK]When I tried to kill myself I took multiple handfuls of pills.|d1ykfda|3238
All that I could find, but it mostly it consisted of advil and iron supplements (for my anemia).|d1ykfda|3239
Then I drank till I could not stand up, laid in the shower puking and cutting.|d1ykfda|3240
I ended with a double digit blood alcohol level and almost lost my liver from the toxicity of the iron and alcohol.|d1ykfda|3241
Its lucky I survived.|d1ykfda|3242
[BK][BK]When I finally sobered up by the next afternoon I just stared at the wall while my parents talked at me and cried.|d1ykfda|3243
I hated myself.|d1ykfda|3244
I could not get fucking suicide right.|d1ykfda|3245
I felt blank.|d1ykfda|3246
I was in shock (or catatonic?)|d1ykfda|3247
for a few days.|d1ykfda|3248
Im better now.|d1ykfda|3249
But waking up and knowing you failed life and on top of that failed suicide, makes you leave the world and withdraw into your mind|d1ykfda|3250
Honestly?|d21jy7i|3251
It was the fact I survived.|d21jy7i|3252
I was heartbroken, devastated.|d21jy7i|3253
Not because of the people I hurt, but because I still hurt and I was still there when I did not want to be anymore.|d21jy7i|3254
I could not understand what I did to deserve to still be here when I just wanted it all to end.|d21jy7i|3255
I thought all those pills I swallowed would end me and they did not.|d21jy7i|3256
[BK][BK]I am only 21, but after a traumatic childhood and the revelation months earlier before my suicide attempt that I was Bipolar, I did not want to be there anymore.|d21jy7i|3257
I was tired of being strong and believing and hoping that it would get better in time when I had been hoping that for years.|d21jy7i|3258
This happened 4 months ago.|d21jy7i|3259
[BK][BK]It was very difficult to deal with in the aftermath because I realized it did not fix anything and I really scared the people close to me.|d21jy7i|3260
And it was not an option for me anymore.|d21jy7i|3261
And that was terrifying because Suicide was always looked at by me as that 'friend' who would be there still if I could not take it anymore.|d21jy7i|3262
And I no longer had that, because I survived.|d21jy7i|3263
[BK][BK]The experience itself changed my life for better or worse because it was the first time I had actually TRIED and nearly succeeded when I had never acted on the thoughts before that moment in time.|d21jy7i|3264
[BK][BK]I do not know what kept me here, but I am happy I stuck around because life has finally started to shape into the way I wanted it to be.|d21jy7i|3265
It's still unpredictable, my mental illness (which by the way, turned out to be co-morbid with Borderline Personality Disorder as well) is never going to go away, and I need to address incidents of the past in therapy...but I am truly feeling as if I can forgive the past for hurting me so much and move on and look at the present more.|d21jy7i|3266
people describe it as an amalgamation of relief and despair.|d1ykcw8|3267
i would say that anyone who wants to commit suicide is not capable of analysing their situation rationally, let alone after a failed attempt.|d1ykcw8|3268
[BK][BK]if they believe they can or could, they are lying.|d1ykcw8|3269
[BK][BK]at the point of suicide most people are emotionally deprived or saturated, based on how i understand the theory.|d1ykcw8|3270
[BK][BK]empathising with this, i assume the position of myself when i feel angry or depressed.|d1ykcw8|3271
not much is going on in my head other than the cause of the problem and the problem itself.|d1ykcw8|3272
"in other words, 'i am aware that i am depressed'"", '"" i do not like it that i am depressed'"", '""i feel depressed, because of x'""."|d1ykcw8|3273
"not '""i feel depressed, let me write down exactly what my thoughts are so that i can reflect on them later, productively'"", because i simply do not feel like doing anything at all."|d1ykcw8|3274
[BK][BK]translating this to suicidal tendencies, i assume that most people are not documenting their experiences and feelings.|d1ykcw8|3275
"they just think that they want to die."""|d1ykcw8|3276
When I woke up from overdosing on every pill I had in the house (I created an overdose basket and put it under my sink in preparation for another low), I felt angry that my mother was in the same room because we did not have a relationship at that time and I did not understand why she was there.|d1z415i|3277
I was angry that I was hooked up to machines.|d1z415i|3278
I remember getting up at one point and going to the bathroom against the doctors orders.|d1z415i|3279
Im not usually angry and Im not usually defiant.|d1z415i|3280
[BK][BK]After the dizziness and anger wore off, I was extremely sad.|d1z415i|3281
Sadder than I ever was.|d1z415i|3282
I felt like I failed and living, and also failed at dying.|d1z415i|3283
I wanted to die so much.|d1z415i|3284
At the point I was in, thinking about dying was the only thing that made me smile.|d1z415i|3285
I tried to negotiate my way out of hospital care but I was stuck.|d1z415i|3286
[BK][BK]I got out of the hospital early because my insurance did not approve the stay.|d1z415i|3287
They offered to let me transfer to a different facility or release me to see a counselor daily.|d1z415i|3288
Of course I elected to leave.|d1z415i|3289
I should have went to the other facility.|d1z415i|3290
[BK][BK]I went home to an empty house and I was lost.|d1z415i|3291
I tried to overdose again but just fell asleep and woke up much later.|d1z415i|3292
I figured if I had to live, I needed to learn how to do it.|d1z415i|3293
[BK][BK]I was assigned a psychiatrist that did not really treat me.|d1z415i|3294
She gave me way to many prescriptions and did not choose to listen.|d1z415i|3295
I gave up going to her and tried to just learn to be happy.|d1z415i|3296
[BK][BK]Here I am, 8 years later, now going to therapy and finally recovering.|d1z415i|3297
I know looking back, my progress stalled because I didnt take the right steps to getting better.|d1z415i|3298
I needed to create a web of support and the right kind of support for me.|d1z415i|3299
Im still going through highs and lows, but its been about 4 years since my last attempt.|d1z415i|3300
Ive found things to live for and Im starting to love myself.|d1z415i|3301
[BK][BK]It isnt easy, and it isnt fun at times.|d1z415i|3302
I catch myself planning things around the house or putting limits on how long Im going to live.|d1z415i|3303
Im married now and he is very understanding without accepting.|d1z415i|3304
His brother recently committed suicide so I was able to see how the pain transfers.|d1z415i|3305
It has been one of the hardest things we have gone through together.|d1z415i|3306
[BK][BK]Please reach out.|d1z415i|3307
If you dont like your therapist, try a new one that may fit your needs better.|d1z415i|3308
Never give up on yourself.|d1z415i|3309

"'""[BK][BK]-  DuB(20$ak)"""|d1y71aa|3311
Fuck why'd I tell my therapist.|d1y793s|3312
When I was about 16 I decided to take every pill in the house.|d200ykq|3313
I was choking them down by the handful and chased it down with some nyquil so I would fall asleep before I started to vomit.|d200ykq|3314
[BK][BK]I remember my dad called before I started to fight the sleep, and slurring that I was glad the I got to talk to him but I had to go now.|d200ykq|3315
[BK][BK]Obviously I woke up the next morning, and my first thoughts were terrible.|d200ykq|3316
I felt like I was such a failure the I could not even kill myself right.|d200ykq|3317
Then I felt incredibly stupid because what I had taken was not even close to lethal.|d200ykq|3318
Some 75 advil, a package of dramamine and a blister pack full of little red pills, I should have chugged the drano under the sink instead.|d200ykq|3319
[BK][BK]My mom took me to the doctor that morning because my friend told the school what I would done, and I was not given a moments privacy for a while, so I obviously did not go back to correct my mistakes.|d200ykq|3320
[BK][BK]I am glad for it now, my life is not great but it is what I got.|d200ykq|3321
[BK][BK]Especially now.|d200ykq|3322
My older brother died 2 years ago, and my dad does not know how close he came to having me kill myself 12 years ago.|d200ykq|3323
I thought I would be less of a burden if I went but after my brother's death, which was not a suicide, I would know that I would haunt this family for fucking ever.|d200ykq|3324
[BK][BK]|d200ykq|3325
I am not a suicide survivor but I saved someone attempting to commit suicide.|d1zkl2v|3326
I was out for a fun with a friend and we saw a gentleman lying  under some trees.|d1zkl2v|3327
There is always an assumption that it will be a drunk person but we checked it out anyway and he had fastened a cord around his neck and was clearly asphyxiating.|d1zkl2v|3328
His lips were blue, eyes bulging, was twitching, he had clearly been crying and was in a bad way.|d1zkl2v|3329
I tried to remove the cord while my friend phoned an ambulance but it was digging deep into his neck so I cut it off with a penknife.|d1zkl2v|3330
As he came to he started fighting me, he really did not want the cord taking off.|d1zkl2v|3331
His first thought was that he wanted to be left alone to die.|d1zkl2v|3332
When he slowly started to come around properly he tried to get up and run away but could not stand and I had to gently restrain him (he was so weak a hand on the shoulder was enough).|d1zkl2v|3333
[BK][BK]I kept talking to him while we waited for help to arrive and when he finally filly regained consciousness he was ashamed and embarrassed at what he had done and kept apologising profusely for letting us see him this way.|d1zkl2v|3334
For me the most depressing part came afterwards, he was whizzed away in an ambulance and we never founs out how he was or what happened to him.|d1zkl2v|3335
[BK][BK]It was the day after Father's Day so that may have had something to do with his suicide attempt but I do not think we will ever know.|d1zkl2v|3336
I am just glad we were running along a deserted bit of the river at the time or he would have died without a doubt.|d1zkl2v|3337
Im 20, I have been thru a lot in life.|d312st2|3338
Going through four suicides my senior year of high school.|d312st2|3339
I have lost 6 people to suicide.|d312st2|3340
October 31st 2015, i was supposed to go camping with some friends, I was not going to go to the party.|d312st2|3341
I had this gut wrenching feeling something bad was going to happen.|d312st2|3342
But al my friends ditched me and I went to that party.|d312st2|3343
I find happiness when I drink and i needed some that night.|d312st2|3344
I told myself I am just gonna drink as much as possible because i do not care what can happen.|d312st2|3345
I woke up in the hospital, the medics said they thought i was dead arriving on the scene.|d312st2|3346
I still sometimes wish to this day that i would have just died.|d312st2|3347
Its always in the back of my mind on a daily basis.|d312st2|3348
I try my best to stay afloat.|d312st2|3349
My car an 88 gl10 subaru sedan is really the only thing that has been keeping me alive.|d312st2|3350
Im a subaru ambassador so I got that gong for me.|d312st2|3351
It still sucks though never knowing exactly when this depression shit is gonna just quit.|d312st2|3352
It'd be cool to just have someone that knows exactly what it feels like to lose your aunt or friend to suicide all within a couple months apart.|d312st2|3353
Its been two years since my aunts suicide and I have yet to bring myself to go visit her at her grave.|d312st2|3354
I want to so bad but I just cannot.|d312st2|3355
Ive been telling myself that Im alright but truly I am still broken....|d312st2|3356
Fuck I am gonna fail this final|d1y78cq|3357
I took 97, 50 mg sleeping pills.|d20tkyb|3358
I was ready to go and be done with all the sadness that my heart just could not handle anymore.|d20tkyb|3359
I spent 3 days on a ventilator as my lungs and kidneys stopped working.|d20tkyb|3360
And for 3 days the Dr.''s asked my family if they wanted to pull the plug because they did not believe I would wake up.|d20tkyb|3361
"Each time my family said, 'No, he is going to wake up!'""."|d20tkyb|3362
And then I did.|d20tkyb|3363
Outwardly I was so sorry for what I put everyone thru.|d20tkyb|3364
They were all so sad and shocked and did not know what to think and so glad that I was still here.|d20tkyb|3365
"But truthfully, my first thought was, '""Why am I still here?'""."|d20tkyb|3366
By all rights I should be dead.|d20tkyb|3367
I do not want to be here.|d20tkyb|3368
Why?|d20tkyb|3369
I went to counseling and did a lot of soul searching and about 6 months ago it was revealed to me why I was still here.|d20tkyb|3370
I am a singer/songwriter and I knew that I had the opportunity to speak for those who did not have such a platform.|d20tkyb|3371
So I decided to write a song about suicide.|d20tkyb|3372
Then I decided to make a music video for suicide prevention.|d20tkyb|3373
I can relate to every person who has ever thought about suicide or even tried it.|d20tkyb|3374
I have been there and I made it.|d20tkyb|3375
And most importantly, I overcame it.|d20tkyb|3376
I am still here and I get to help other people, just like me, every single day.|d20tkyb|3377
It gets better, I promise you that.|d20tkyb|3378
To anyone on the fence, sit and talk with me awhile.|d20tkyb|3379
I will not blow smoke up your butt, the answers are NEVER easy.|d20tkyb|3380
It''s NOT the cowards way out.|d20tkyb|3381
But there is a better way.|d20tkyb|3382
We are each gifted and so special in our own ways, we just need to recognize that our value is not based on upon other peoples perceptions of our worth.|d20tkyb|3383
[BK][BK]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq56VDonz5I[BK][BK]Here''s the link to the video.|d20tkyb|3384
If you or someone you know is suicidal, watch this or share it and follow the links to get help.|d20tkyb|3385
If you just want to help, ALL the money from the sales of this song are donated back into various suicide prevention organizations.|d20tkyb|3386
I do not make a dime from this, I just want to help people and let you know that I want you to stick around.|d20tkyb|3387
Please, stay.|d20tkyb|3388

Two years ago I was really drunk and high and ran into the middle of a street right around a curve.|d5z7p2i|3390
I blacked out and woke up laying next to the street crying with my best friend and a few others standing around me.|d5z7p2i|3391
Immediately after I was so upset that it had not worked and that I was still living.|d5z7p2i|3392
Inside the house I went to the bathroom and cut myself all over my arm and fell asleep.|d5z7p2i|3393
The next morning I woke up in the room with my best friend.|d5z7p2i|3394
The first thing I said was.|d5z7p2i|3395
"'I am glad I am still alive'"" and she said '""me too'"" and we hugged."""|d5z7p2i|3396
Well I got really drunk and took some pills like a lot at least looking back it seemed like a lot then I woke up, and well was in disbelief and a lot of pain, then I had to hide it so no one would know what happened and I went horse back riding a little more than an hour later.|d1y1p7q|3397

I stole two bottles of pills from my dad's cabinet, and after 5th period at school that day, I swallowed them all.|d20x45s|3406
I felt I was storming into the front line of battle.|d20x45s|3407
I was a vulnerable solider, unarmed and disoriented, but I knew could no longer hide in the bushes, I must strike fast and hard, all the while knowing that I would be struck down, like Butch Cassidy.|d20x45s|3408
But at least the waiting would end.|d20x45s|3409

Sometimes I would hope that in my drunken state, I would take my life.|d1y5kfq|3428
There was numerous times that I woke up to messages from friends saying they were worried about me because I was in a state of madness and was cursing allowed, yelling about how fucked up my head was and that I was going to kill myself.|d1y5kfq|3429
[BK][BK]One night I had enough.|d1y5kfq|3430
There was a few events that took place that day that pushed a bit further than before.|d1y5kfq|3431
From what I remember I had 5 jager bombs, and a pitcher of beer.|d1y5kfq|3432
I was with two coworkers playing pool and thankfully they looked after me, even though I was being selfish and making a scene.|d1y5kfq|3433

I remember hating myself for failing as I cleaned the floor though.|d1y62lp|3445
I had an acquaintance from high school try to kill himself by shooting himself in the chest.|d1y4akq|3446
The round squibbed, meaning it misfired and the round was stuck in the barrel.|d1y4akq|3447
He assumed because he saw a bit of smoke and heard a quiet pop, that he was dying and was euphoric since he did not feel anything.|d1y4akq|3448
Nope, round failed to do anything.|d1y4akq|3449
He realized what happened and instead of being angry, was relieved and decided he wanted to live rather than his mom come home and find his body in a pool of blood.|d1y4akq|3450
He cleared the squibbed round, cleaned the gun and called a doctor.|d1y4akq|3451

Passed out walking down a sidewalk, and some good Samaritan called an ambulance.|d1y6d5c|3458
[BK][BK]Long story short, no one knows.|d1y6d5c|3459
When asked where I was, I just say I was out of town for a card tournament and a convention.|d1y6d5c|3460
Not even my best friend knows because I am afraid she will be upset that I broke our promise.|d1y6d5c|3461
"We promised each other that should we make an attempt on our own lives, we will tell each other first."""|d1y6d5c|3462
First time: I NEED TO USE THE MALE RESTROOM WHY WONT YOU LET ME USE IT?!|d1y6cit|3463
[BK][BK]Second time: Thank god, that would have been a shitty way to go.|d1y6cit|3464
I should have just drank some robitussin instead.|d1y6cit|3465
Ok so this seems like the perfect place to get some info and advice.|d1y6d4d|3466
[BK][BK]So my girlfriend's parents are getting divorced.|d1y6d4d|3467
It all started when they caught her dad cheating.|d1y6d4d|3468
In all the fighting mess he said he never really loved her and was just waiting for the kids to grow up.|d1y6d4d|3469
I believe this, based on how depressed he always seemed.|d1y6d4d|3470
But on to the part where I need advice.|d1y6d4d|3471
Her mom has tried to commit suicide twice in the past couple weeks, is a complete mess emotionally, and is crazy depressed.|d1y6d4d|3472
My gf has tries to help but just gets frustrated because her mom will not listen to any advice or do anything to better herself, in fact she is actively making her life harder by not going to work and not paying bills.|d1y6d4d|3473
My question is what do you say or do to help someone who has completely given up?|d1y6d4d|3474
It's like the only thing on her mind is how she can get away with killing herself.|d1y6d4d|3475
"'Why did I stop'"" [BK][BK]Shortly after realizing that I had survived my suicide attempt, I tried to better myself by reading book and playing video games."|d1y4vwz|3476
But that did not last very long.|d1y4vwz|3477
[BK][BK]About two months later after my first suicide attempt, I tried to do it again for personal reasons.|d1y4vwz|3478
And those reasons I did not have control over.|d1y4vwz|3479
I was alone through the whole trip.|d1y4vwz|3480
I did not have anyone.|d1y4vwz|3481
I was not a complete loner, I had friends that I would socialize with and hang out with, but none of them knew how I was truly feeling.|d1y4vwz|3482
[BK][BK]After my third attempt, I decided to tell one of my close friends that I have attempted suicide on three different occasions.|d1y4vwz|3483
"She just laughed and said, '""do not be a bitch, grow a pair'"" after that I became more revert."|d1y4vwz|3484
I stopped hanging out, I stopped going out to parties.|d1y4vwz|3485
I was completely alone.|d1y4vwz|3486
I had no idea what to do, I did not know what to do.|d1y4vwz|3487
I gave myself support for all these years and thoughtout high school I made, maybe two more suicide attempts.|d1y4vwz|3488
[BK][BK]Shortly after my freshman year of high school, I met a girl that helped me cope with all this pain and she understood everything.|d1y4vwz|3489
She did not tell me to kill myself, she did not berate me, she supported me all the way.|d1y4vwz|3490
I would sometimes call her in the middle of the night crying my eyes out because I was feeling depressed and she would help me.|d1y4vwz|3491
[BK][BK]Come sophomore year, she passed away in a car crash.|d1y4vwz|3492
I was absolutely devastated.|d1y4vwz|3493
The only person that has ever helped me has just passed away and I was alone again.|d1y4vwz|3494
I stayed alone for another 2 years.|d1y4vwz|3495
I made it through by thinking about what she said and how to keep going and not stay in the past.|d1y4vwz|3496
[BK][BK]Now, I have a close friend that truly helps me out a lot.|d1y4vwz|3497
She is talked me out of 2 suicide attempts and I forever thankful for her support.|d1y4vwz|3498
"I do not know where I would be without her support or my long time friend. """|d1y4vwz|3499
I attempted to kill myself by using a knife and cutting open my stomach.|d4cs7yv|3500
I am guessing whereever I stabbed did not cause enough damage to actually kill me or make me faint from blood loss and just die from lack of blood.|d4cs7yv|3501
When I realized I was not going to die soon from this I tried to move the knife around more to cause more damage, but the pain was too much for me to bear.|d4cs7yv|3502
"I kept crying and shouting 'I cannot even do this right'""."|d4cs7yv|3503
Eventually one of the neighbors heard my shouting and complained to the apartment  staff.|d4cs7yv|3504
They found me in my bathroom covered in blood still shouting the same thing over and over and called an ambulance.|d4cs7yv|3505
When I finally was able to put some rational thought to it, I cried and was unable to process things really.|d4cs7yv|3506
I thought myself to be the failure who could not even leave this world correctly.|d4cs7yv|3507
It has been 2 years since then.|d4cs7yv|3508
Honestly some days are still pretty bad and other are good.|d4cs7yv|3509
"The future is world completely unknown and I am just hoping that the good days will start to outweigh the bad ones."""|d4cs7yv|3510
"'I am sorry'""[BK][BK]I am not a sociable person."|d1y7ua3|3511
I keep small friend groups to avoid drama, and to not disappoint a lot of people when I move after community college.|d1y7ua3|3512
In a result of this, I have had a total of five really close friends.|d1y7ua3|3513
Everyone else in my eyes was an ''acquaintance'' of some sort, someone that I just ''Knew''.|d1y7ua3|3514
I would not think twice about having a personal conversation with them.|d1y7ua3|3515
[BK][BK]I had lost my last good friend to a car accident.|d1y7ua3|3516
To add onto that?|d1y7ua3|3517
Every single one of them died from car accidents within a three year span, all in the same general area, all due to high speed leading to fishtailing.|d1y7ua3|3518
[BK][BK]None of the other deaths affected me.|d1y7ua3|3519
I was genially worried after the third of five close friends passed without me shedding a single tear.|d1y7ua3|3520
This lead to Insomnia, which led to my doctor prescribing me sleep aid, as well as referring me to a therapist.|d1y7ua3|3521
[BK][BK]I tried overdosing on sleeping pills.|d1y7ua3|3522
Not to an extreme amount, but still enough to where I had a possibility of dying in my sleep (I do not remember much of the previous few hours of taking them, so I could not tell you the exact amount).|d1y7ua3|3523
I decided if I woke up still alive, it was a sign to keep pushing through life.|d1y7ua3|3524
[BK][BK]When I woke up the day after, everything seemed a lot brighter than usual.|d1y7ua3|3525
Not brighter like the sun was out without clouds, but like if you were to play a video game and turn the contrast and brightness way too high.|d1y7ua3|3526
I assumed this was the afterlife, but due to me not having any religious views, I did not know what would happen.|d1y7ua3|3527
None of that mattered though, because the only thing I could think about was how sorry I was.|d1y7ua3|3528
[BK][BK]I had family, and no matter the fact I isolated myself from most of them, they all loved me.|d1y7ua3|3529
If I was dead, they would not have spoken to me since my graduation of high school.|d1y7ua3|3530
These ''Acquaintances'' I had thought of themselves more than that to me.|d1y7ua3|3531
Although I did not believe it, they did care about me.|d1y7ua3|3532
Worst of all was that I had refused to communicate with my mother for the past three months.|d1y7ua3|3533
For what reason?|d1y7ua3|3534
I have no idea.|d1y7ua3|3535
One day I just decided I was tired of hearing her voice, and just stopped making effort to communicate with her.|d1y7ua3|3536
[BK][BK]Eventually, I did come to me senses, and the ''brightness'' went down.|d1y7ua3|3537
I realized I was still in my room (although for some reason I was on the floor), and I got up oddly feeling normal.|d1y7ua3|3538
My life did not flash through my eyes, and I did not meet god or anything.|d1y7ua3|3539
I got ready for classes, and went to them.|d1y7ua3|3540
[BK][BK]Although nothing noteworthy besides the sorry thoughts happened, I took in a lot from those thoughts.|d1y7ua3|3541
That day I went to my mothers house and spent the day with her, and have been doing that weekly.|d1y7ua3|3542
I have reached out to small friends and have developed relationships with them, even starting dating someone.|d1y7ua3|3543
[BK][BK]That all happened six months ago.|d1y7ua3|3544
I did not talk to my councilor about it, and when my doctor asked why I needed a refill so early on my sleep aid, I told him I accidentally lost half the bottle down the drain.|d1y7ua3|3545
The whole event stayed in the back of my mind till this thread came up, which I took as an opportunity to share my experience.|d1y7ua3|3546
I want everyone to know that suicide is not the answer.|d1y7ua3|3547
There are always people who you can reach out to, and always a solution.|d1y7ua3|3548
A temporary problem should not be solved by a permanent fate.|d1y7ua3|3549
"[BK][BK]Stay strong everyone!"""|d1y7ua3|3550
I became aware of the beeping and the volume of distant murmurs turning up, and I looked around and was startled by the look of concern on the nurse's face.|d1y6o4g|3551
I felt immediately like trying to calm her but I sort of disappeared back into myself for a bit.|d1y6o4g|3552
The thing is you can never be sure whether you succeeded or not, that to me is reason enough not to do it, lotta people do not tell you that|d1y6o4g|3553
For me my thoughts were moving too quick to really pick out any one thought.|d1y6jww|3554
If anything I would say the first feeling was a bit of soul crushing relief knowing that the pressures of my life had just passed me by.|d1y6jww|3555
I was no longer on track to be a college grad, or get married, or be financially stable.|d1y6jww|3556
I could take life one day at a time and no matter how bad it got at least I was still alive.|d1y6jww|3557
I had a .22 revolver to my head.|d1y6nlc|3558
When I pulled the trigger I heard the click.|d1y6nlc|3559
Then I realized that I heard the fucking click.|d1y6nlc|3560
I was not laying in a pool of my own blood at my desk but I was fully awake and aware that I heard the sound of the hammer hitting the round.|d1y6nlc|3561
[BK][BK]I sat there for a minute with the gun to my head before lowering it and pulling the cylinder.|d1y6nlc|3562
I checked the bullet and the rim was dented.|d1y6nlc|3563
The hammer had made contact but it did not fire.|d1y6nlc|3564
It was in that moment I thought 'Have I cheated Death or did Death cheat me?|d1y6nlc|3565
"'""[BK][BK]I have had a much different outlook since then."|d1y6nlc|3566
I realized I was mortal, I should have been dead but somehow I made it out alive.|d1y6nlc|3567
From then on I lived a little more.|d1y6nlc|3568
Anything from that point forward was a bonus on the life I was going to have.|d1y6nlc|3569
I bought a motorcycle, I left my controlling girlfriend.|d1y6nlc|3570
I went to the strip club and blew $1500 in a night.|d1y6nlc|3571
I have lived.|d1y6nlc|3572
"I have lived more in the 3 years since than I did in the 24 years prior."""|d1y6nlc|3573
How can you fail suicide?|d1y6o6s|3574
I think the people dont really want to die or why do they not just jump in front of a train or jump down a high building?|d1y6o6s|3575
I dont want to be mean.|d1y6o6s|3576
That's something to improve on next time so this does not happen.|d1y7xmc|3577
I felt bad for myself.|d1y53bu|3578
I do not have to say anything.|d1y53bu|3579
[BK][BK]I was about 12-13 and was bullied heavily where I went to school.|d1y53bu|3580
Went through puberty before everyone else, was tall and fat, had an abusive childhood and was ultimately robbed of happiness.|d1y53bu|3581
One night I tied my belt around my neck and looped it to the support beam in the basement.|d1y53bu|3582
[BK][BK]The belt snapped, I fell to the ground and gasped for air.|d1y53bu|3583
I felt like everyone was right, I am fat.|d1y53bu|3584
I did not want to go upstairs to my abusive family either.|d1y53bu|3585
I wanted to be hanging from the belt where I could have been happier.|d1y53bu|3586
[BK][BK]Fast forward, I used the depression at fuel to change my life and do a 180.|d1y53bu|3587
Sometimes I go back down a dark path, but I can usually redirect it elsewhere.|d1y53bu|3588
I was really, really scared.|d1y4cs4|3589
"The police were there, and I was scared that this was now going to become a huge thing and I would not be able to 'finish the job,'"" if you will."|d1y4cs4|3590
They took me to the hospital, and I was completely helpless.|d1y4cs4|3591
I could not leave.|d1y4cs4|3592
Everything in me just wanted to be done and here I kept having to take tests and talk to person after person, and it was completely up to these nameless people when I would be allowed to walk out of there.|d1y4cs4|3593
I was dead set on saying and doing whatever I had to in order to be discharged and pick a better vehicle to come to completion.|d1y4cs4|3594
[BK][BK]Turns out there is a reason for keeping people against their will.|d1y4cs4|3595
After a couple days, I changed my mind.|d1y4cs4|3596
Decided to work on myself and try to find something within me to keep alive.|d1y4cs4|3597
"9 years this last March and counting, thanks to our boys in blue. """|d1y4cs4|3598
'Where the fuck am I?|d1y6qnw|3599

WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING HERE?!?!?|d1y6qnw|3601
"'""[BK][BK]I do not really remember the suicide attempt, or even the choice."|d1y6qnw|3602

I was blackout drunk already.|d1y6qnw|3604
[BK][BK]I would been dealing with several months of hardcore sleep deprivation.|d1y6qnw|3605
I got a few reprieves but it went something like 1-2 hours of very fragmented sleep a night.|d1y6qnw|3606
The rest of it was just drowsiness but no sleep.|d1y6qnw|3607
Every night.|d1y6qnw|3608
Every fucking night.|d1y6qnw|3609
Worst stretch was 4 weeks of this.|d1y6qnw|3610

[BK]Then gross motor skills.|d1y6qnw|3612
[BK]Then judgment.|d1y6qnw|3613
[BK]Then mood.|d1y6qnw|3614
[BK]Then complete mental state.|d1y6qnw|3615
I do not just mean stability but conscious perception started getting fucked.|d1y6qnw|3616
[BK][BK]And the physical misery.|d1y6qnw|3617
Boy!|d1y6qnw|3618
"You know those charts they keep in a hospital '""How''s your pain today?'"""|d1y6qnw|3619
"0-10 where 10 is screaming agony unable to respond the pain is overwhelming, 9 is close, 8 is fucking miserable mate.... so on....[BK][BK]Imagine the same scale but '""intense physical discomfort'"" without any actual sensation of pain."|d1y6qnw|3620
I was probably a 9 on such a scale.|d1y6qnw|3621
My hands were the wrong shape and muscles attached every which way, all of them wrong.|d1y6qnw|3622
The world spun in peculiar and decidedly unpleasant ways and I generally felt the worst sensations of physically being on a very large roller coaster.|d1y6qnw|3623
Finger spasms non stop, same with legs.|d1y6qnw|3624
Sometimes unable to even hold a pencil.|d1y6qnw|3625
Sometimes unable to walk.|d1y6qnw|3626
I had very little direct control over my muscles by that point.|d1y6qnw|3627
Taken to ER twice for what appeared to be a seizure.|d1y6qnw|3628
Wasn''t.|d1y6qnw|3629
[BK][BK]All from sleep deprivation.|d1y6qnw|3630
[BK][BK]To be clear my body was putting me through shit normally reserved for when the CIA really wants to tear a human being apart.|d1y6qnw|3631
[BK][BK]Worst time of my life, and that is saying a lot.|d1y6qnw|3632
[BK][BK]A few times after this I was very suicidal but thankfully was under supervision.|d1y6qnw|3633

Dear God not like that.|d1y6qnw|3636

Very happily.|d1y6qnw|3638
Easily too, though I fear the vague possibility of a world where these two simple medications are no longer available to me.|d1y6qnw|3639
"Not likely though."""|d1y6qnw|3640
"'When the fuck am I gonna finally be able to die'""[BK][BK]Still think that today"""|d1y6rc8|3641
I think being in a suicide facility shut out from everyone you know is the worst part of my attempt though and being roomed with a woman who reminded me and favored my grandmother who passed away two years prior was torture Alone.|d1y4mqn|3642
I weigh about 115 and swallowed 16 600mg ibuprofen pills and they did not work but I practically felt dead being shoved into that facility where you cannot try again and  you are stuck  being alone with the thoughts that put you there to begin with.|d1y4mqn|3643
But seeing everyone else in there made me realize I want to help others see a better light to life I just wanted to add this.|d1y4mqn|3644
Woke up in the hospital being babysat by an obese old lady.|d1y4e7m|3645
First thought was GODDAMNIT I FAIL AT EVERYTHING.|d1y4e7m|3646
I tried ripping out my IV, my catheter (I am female), and everything attached.|d1y4e7m|3647
I was unconscious for 3 days.|d1y4e7m|3648
Took 100+ klonopins plus a half a bottle of Tylenol.|d1y4e7m|3649
After that first thought, I passed out again and woke up in the psych ward.|d1y4e7m|3650
I was on a hold for 3 days.|d1y4e7m|3651
[BK][BK]I want to try again.|d1y4e7m|3652
I am just scared of 1) it not working again and 2) seeing the faces of my family AGAIN after failing.|d1y4e7m|3653

I am just fucking miserable.|d1y4e7m|3655
'Fuck, I am not going to die.|d1y4ta0|3656
"'""[BK][BK]About three years ago I took a lot of pills, somewhere around 120."|d1y4ta0|3657
What I did not think through was the fact my body was going to reject them, and I started vomiting uncontrollably.|d1y4ta0|3658
I got really scared; I worried I was not going to die, but something bad was going to happen and I would have to live with it.|d1y4ta0|3659
So I went to the hospital, had to have activated charcoal put in my stomach via feeding tube(?)|d1y4ta0|3660
and then a day or two later I woke up.|d1y4ta0|3661
I spent a few days after that in the hospital because they were monitoring me for serotonin syndrome and I also had to wait to talk to a social worker because I was under 18 at the time.|d1y4ta0|3662
That whole experience is a bit of a blur and I honestly do not really think about it anymore and nobody besides my family who was around at the time know.|d1y4ta0|3663
[BK][BK]What I do know is that the most painful part of the whole experience was seeing how it affected my family.|d1y4ta0|3664
"Because of that alone I would never try it again, but I would be lying if I said I am glad I was unsuccessful."""|d1y4ta0|3665

"There came a point when I did not think she would come out of her coma and I was like, 'fuck all of this.'"""|d1y6s7d|3670
Now, the pills caused so much pain as they tore up my insides; I have an allergy to that medication (like the medical version of severe nut allergy) so my body went into massive shock, rejected everything and made me pay for it for weeks.|d1y6s7d|3671

When I woke up I was really REALLY fucked up, but in a high way not a bad way and I really enjoyed it.|d1y6t6r|3678
I am really hard on the alcohol now.|d1y6t6r|3679
I still get suicidal at times but I just hit the liquor store.|d1y6t6r|3680

For those who suffer from depression as I did for over a decade, there is hope!|d1y5nvw|3686
[MAPS](http://www.maps.org/research) is working with the FDA doing clinical trials with various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, Ibogaine, and Ayahuasca, for use with psychotherapy in order to treat a variety of psychological and emotional problems including PTSD, trauma, anxiety, depression, and addiction.|d1y5nvw|3687
These trails have been working extremely well with success rates higher than that of traditional treatments.|d1y5nvw|3688
They plan on legalizing MDMA for prescribed use by 2021 and I would expect the legalization of the others to follow not long after.|d1y5nvw|3689
I recommend taking a look at their site where they have promising research on these substances, as well as others.|d1y5nvw|3690
The first one I can clearly remember was 'Now what?'|d1y6td0|3691

I am going to be wearing long sleeves for a very long time.|d1y5m9t|3722
My thoughts on suicide...people always seem to default to you being depressed.|d1y5m9t|3723
I do not think that was ever the case with me.|d1y5m9t|3724
Sometimes, life sucks and it is a calculated logical decision.|d1y5m9t|3725
You are doing it out of compassion for yourself, to end pain and suffering.|d1y5m9t|3726
Like shooting a deer that has been hit by a car.|d1y5m9t|3727
When I was 14 I tried to hang myself with a vacuum cleaner cord( I know stupid of me to think that would work).|d1y5oqz|3728
My weight broke through it while I was slipping out of consciousness and sliced my neck up pretty badly.|d1y5oqz|3729
I felt regret immediately when I came to because one I had failed, and two my parents were in shambles about it.|d1y5oqz|3730
That was 3 years ago and I am still in that mental state, it has not gotten any better.|d1y5oqz|3731
Part of which is because I have beaten cancer once, I had a small cancerous tumor in my leg, but I currently have a non-cancerous brain tumor that causes some crazy headaches.|d1y5oqz|3732
There's a lot more to my life story that brought me down this path, I am hoping university will help me and that my tumor would just not be there anymore.|d1y5oqz|3733
I came out of a really bad fight with the folks.|d1y6txd|3734

I do not remember the attempt, and hardly what happened after.|d1y5vn4|3740
But when I regained consciousness, I regretted not succeed.|d1y5vn4|3741
After that (it is been 4 or 5 years), I started planning another attempt, but then I got a boyfriend as the last chance to life.|d1y5vn4|3742
He was the only reason to keep alive for the 4 and half years we stayed together, not even my family was reason enough.|d1y5vn4|3743
Now the only reason I do not kill myself is that it would give too much trouble for the people that would find me.|d1y5vn4|3744
While I do not craft some crazy machine that would evaporate my body painlessly, I am treating with meds and cbt.|d1y5vn4|3745
I am trying, but the thought of keep living is exhausting.|d1y5vn4|3746
I do not watch news anymore, the only news source I use is the onion, I am trying to do lists to follow weekly, eating health, exercising, etc etc.|d1y5vn4|3747
But still, I resent the ex-bf.|d1y5vn4|3748
If I did not date him, I would kill myself while I still did not care about the others.|d1y5vn4|3749
I hope someday I will thank him for it.|d1y5vn4|3750
"But for now, I cannot stop thinking that being dead would be better """|d1y5vn4|3751
I have tried commuting suicide several times.|d1y5vn6|3752
Once after I was molested when I was a kid; I drank some bleach and my father found me on the floor and took me to the hospital.|d1y5vn6|3753
I thought I did not drink enough so try something else.|d1y5vn6|3754
Second time was via me taking a bunch of pills.|d1y5vn6|3755
I passed out and woke up with my gut feeling horrific.|d1y5vn6|3756
Third time was after I moved back home for a little bit.|d1y5vn6|3757
I had a gun and decided that would be the most effective way to do it, so loaded it and pulled the trigger.|d1y5vn6|3758
Gun had jammed.|d1y5vn6|3759
My sister came home and I did not want to do it with her there so I put it away.|d1y5vn6|3760
Eventually got rid of it.|d1y5vn6|3761
It's seven years later and I still think about suicide frequently.|d1y5vn6|3762
Its not all the time any more, though.|d1y5vn6|3763
Each time I have just hated myself more for failing to do even that.|d1y5vn6|3764

I let go.|d1ygfvc|3770

[BK][BK][BK]A few weeks ago, I took a razor from work home with me, had an entire plan, but accepted a coworkers offer to go smoke with him after work.|d1yqbny|3801
I love weed but at that state I almost decline just so I could go home and put my plan into action.|d1yqbny|3802
Instead, I went to my coworkers, we blazed, he helped to try to find me an apartment (I was just kicked out of where I was living at the time, on top of a host of other things ogoin on in my life and how I was looking at myself) and we had some laughs and it helped me re-focus.|d1yqbny|3803

I still had chances of happiness on this earth .|d1ypcj4|3823
Which has been true.|d1ypcj4|3824
It was not a specific suicide attempt, but I had hurt myself really badly.|d1yxnn7|3825
I cut myself and when I saw the skin separate like cutting into raw chicken or something, I panicked.|d1yxnn7|3826
It was about midnight, only my mom was awake.|d1yxnn7|3827
Immediately my first thought was I need to tell my mom, I need my mom, she can fix it.|d1yxnn7|3828

[BK][BK]To be frank, it was not a deliberate suicide attempt, but when I was in the middle of a deep pool and I started panicking, half my brain wanted me to accept it, while the other half wanted me to wait for Wednesday to hear about a girl talk about Christ.|d1y71v4|3841
Long story short, she shared about Christ, and my life is now much, much better.|d1y71v4|3842

However  went to study for masters in economics later on.|d1z3ate|3910
[BK]I really had everything just about right in my life, I had already lived abroad, worked abroad, become fluent on german etc.|d1z3ate|3911
Studies were great.|d1z3ate|3912
I went to Munich (where I also have lived before) with a bunch of friends and just out of nowhere, I tried to jump in front of a subway train at Marienplatz subway station.|d1z3ate|3913
My friends literally saved my life by wrestling me down.|d1z3ate|3914
I was very very drunk, the hangover lasted all the way back home on a car (1500 miles, 48 hours) [BK]Til this day I do not know what happened.|d1z3ate|3915
I just got very drunk and tried to kill my self by getting absolutely maimed by a fucking train.|d1z3ate|3916
I do tend to get depressed, I still think that i should never been born.|d1z3ate|3917
But I really would never dare to kill my self.|d1z3ate|3918
And I never to this day admit to my friends that I remember what happened, was a complete shock to wake up next day and to hear them talk about this and the mood was..|d1z3ate|3919
I would say half of them completely disappeared from my life and half stay in touch after graduation, needless to say I am really ashamed of how our trip to Oktoberfest and to my Ex hometown ended..[BK][BK]Actually quite frankly I just want to start over and forget about the past, been a lifelong alcoholic and used drugs and tranquilizers heavily as a teen, to escape the reality.|d1z3ate|3920
And never since tried again, never going to and really made progress by not drinking, not using anything and really working hard to start all over (applying all the time for jobs in Germany as the Job market back home really suck at the moment (unemployment being ~18% measured by the governmental employment ministry)[BK][BK]Also was the happiest time in my life when I lived in Germany.|d1z3ate|3921

Apparently they did not really know what to do with someone who broke down their reasoning for suicide the way I did.|d1z69os|3935
[BK][BK]It''s always been a pretty simple equation in my mind.|d1z69os|3936
If the sum of my negative and neutral experiences has greater weight than the value of my positive experiences, it was my preference to not exist, rather than to exist.|d1z69os|3937
There is no meaning or purpose to life beyond that which the person experiencing it assigns to it.|d1z69os|3938
If the person experiencing life feels there is no value in it, then there is no reason to continue experiencing it.|d1z69os|3939
[BK][BK]It''s been 15 years since then, and I still hold that opinion.|d1z69os|3940
My experience with life has been amusing at best, and pretty horrible at worst.|d1z69os|3941
I have obligations to meet and promises to keep though, so I continue to wake up in the morning.|d1z69os|3942
Do I have depression?|d1z69os|3943
Certainly.|d1z69os|3944
But I have been dealing with that for twenty years or so, I can deal with it a few more.|d1z69os|3945

[BK][BK]Finally, if *you* are feeling depressed or suicidal, talk to someone.|d1z69os|3947
It may just help.|d1z69os|3948
My understanding is that for many people medication, therapy or trusted friends can help.|d1z69os|3949
You owe it to yourself to give it a shot.|d1z69os|3950
If it is an event or series of events that has made you consider ending things, try giving it some time.|d1z69os|3951

I never want to go there again.|d1y76ux|3972
"'Yep, I must be dead, because I am still in hell.'"""""|d1y93au|3973
Never shared the full story with anyone, but here goes:[BK][BK]In 2012 I was diagnosed with a neuro-degenerative illness and was told there are only a few dozen active recorded cases, and in past cases some patients have gotten something called [Morvan's Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morvan%27s_syndrome) which leads to fatal insomnia.|d1y9fbq|3974
[BK][BK]I was hospitalized for a month because my lung function was severely affected by the illness for a short time and I developed dementia and what appeared to be hallucinations (I do not remember most of my time at the hospital).|d1y9fbq|3975
Even then I was getting pretty decent sleep, so Morvan's syndrome was not on my radar until doctors told me it could become a real possibility (the EEG's showed I was getting very little REM sleep).|d1y9fbq|3976
Thankfully my lung function started to improve and I was released from the hospital, and went back to work.|d1y9fbq|3977
I was also given a drug called oxcarbazapine to help with the muscle issues.|d1y9fbq|3978
[BK][BK]About 2 months after getting released from the hospital I started sleep walking.|d1y9fbq|3979
And really really walking.|d1y9fbq|3980
I lived alone and would open the door in my sleep, and walk off into the city.|d1y9fbq|3981
I would usually find myself somewhere a mile or two away, and my legs would be in extreme pain, like I had been running.|d1y9fbq|3982
Needless to say it was pretty terrifying and I was basically getting no sleep.|d1y9fbq|3983
[BK][BK]This had been going on for a couple of weeks, and I was still going to work, and one Friday a work friend I had known for years asked me if I wanted to play games with a group of friends that night, and I said yes.|d1y9fbq|3984
When I got there I met my friend at the door and then slowly began talking to other people as they talked to me, and then I introduced myself by name to one guy and he laughed and said he knew who I was, and that we had all hung out together the weekend before...|d1y9fbq|3985
I had absolutely no memory of this, and I started to feel really fucking confused and nauseous and drove home.|d1y9fbq|3986
Later that night I woke up in a lawn with the sprinklers going...|d1y9fbq|3987
I was about a mile from my house.|d1y9fbq|3988
Sleep deprived, confused, and angry I walked back to my house and downed ALL of my pills.|d1y9fbq|3989
[BK][BK]Less than 20 minutes later I was hurling... and because my muscles are fucked up, some of it started aspirating into my lungs...|d1y9fbq|3990
I fucking panicked and called 911.|d1y9fbq|3991
The fire station was about 2 blocks from my house, and it felt like they were there in seconds, I did not even have to open the door...|d1y9fbq|3992
I just looked up and there were people in my house and I could see red lights flashing through the window.|d1y9fbq|3993
[BK][BK]They took me to the hospital, and started to give me some sludge stuff to drink that was supposed to keep me from absorbing much more... it was awful, and I was vomiting and aspirating a bit more, and I told them to stop.|d1y9fbq|3994
And the nurses kept doing it, but a doctor came in and told them to stop because the drug I had taken was not very potent in overdoses and because he did not think pumping my stomach would help because I would be okay.|d1y9fbq|3995
[BK][BK]The first thought was not thankfulness or hope, or anything like that...|d1y9fbq|3996
Instead I can only describe it as being entirely in the moment.|d1y9fbq|3997
Like nothing else mattered outside of the now, there was no work, no relationships, no responsibilities.|d1y9fbq|3998
I just felt very alive and conscious of everything that was going on.|d1y9fbq|3999
[BK][BK]I stayed there overnight and half of the next day before getting released.|d1y9fbq|4000
Initially they said I would be there at least three days, but the afternoon after the night I was admitted a doctor came in smiling and said he had good news.|d1y9fbq|4001
He said he had spoken to someone about the oxcarbazapine drug I was taking, and that person told him that a very very small percentage of people taking it start sleepwalking.|d1y9fbq|4002
He told me to stop taking it, and said the nurses would bring me paperwork to discharge me and give me numbers to call if I again felt the way I had when I had been admitted.|d1y9fbq|4003
[BK][BK]It's been 4 years now, and while I still have major issues with the neurodegenerative illness, I have never had sleepwalking problems again since stopping my prescription for the drug.|d1y9fbq|4004
[BK][BK]**TL;DR:** My initial thoughts before knowing I would be okay were a feeling of being in a totally surreal place and disconnected from life... and then that transitioned into very 'in the moment' thoughts and feelings when I learned I was not successful.|d1y9fbq|4005
Everything felt very... real.|d1y9fbq|4006
I took sixteen pills of 50 mg Sertraline, four pills of 0.5 mg Lorazepam (Ativan), a can of redbull, a bottle of prescription cough medicine (Codeine), and alcohol.|d1zbyq2|4007
At that point, my anxiety kept me from sleeping and eating.|d1zbyq2|4008
I was a 21 year-old Asian girl and just weighed a little over 100 lbs.|d1zbyq2|4009
I was up and about walking around in public until I started throwing up and I was sent to the hospital.|d1zbyq2|4010
"When I came to, the first thought that came to mind was 'I failed...again.'"""|d1zbyq2|4011
There were just these endless tears that would roll down my cheeks.|d1zbyq2|4012
Even then I felt like an empty vessel.|d1zbyq2|4013
I still did not feel very much alive at all and mostly just detached from everyone and everything.|d1zbyq2|4014
I was watching the world in third person through a gray filter.|d1zbyq2|4015
I wanted to leave the hospital and rip out the IV in my arm, but I was honestly also too exhausted to fight anyone.|d1zbyq2|4016
There was always someone watching me from outside the room in the hospital.|d1zbyq2|4017
They would come in to check on me from time to time.|d1zbyq2|4018
"At one point she asked me why I was crying and all I could respond was '""I do not know.'"""|d1zbyq2|4019
Since I live out of state for college, my parents could not come to the hospital in person, but it broke my heart to hear how much I hurt them when I spoke to them on the phone.|d1zbyq2|4020
It broke my heart to see how much I hurt my closest friends.|d1zbyq2|4021
It changed the reality of what I had originally thought to be the truth but it was really just a delusion that my depression wanted me to believe in.|d1zbyq2|4022
My three days spent at the hospital were full of lies straight through my teeth and I somehow managed to convince the stream of staff members that I do not need any more medication and counseling that I never went but cancelled.|d1zbyq2|4023
[BK][BK]Now a days, there is still a nagging thought in my head that maybe I would be better off dead.|d1zbyq2|4024
I try to keep it at bay with days/nights that are so lit that I am grateful to be surrounded by good vibes and good people.|d1zbyq2|4025
I am thankful for the support from my family and friends and I find it very difficult to understand why I still feel the way I do.|d1zbyq2|4026
Because existing does not feel like it is enough for me.|d1zbyq2|4027
"[BK][BK]"""|d1zbyq2|4028
"I will never forget the moment, after the call to come to the hospital, after following the ambulance to a distant town because lifeflight was grounded due to snow, after over 12 hours of holding his body, holding his head, as he slowly regained consciousness but was still not within his head due to the toxicity of all that he swallowed, through the hallucinations when he was conscious that we tried to have him breathe through, I just remember that moment, when his eyes cleared and I saw HIM in those eyes for just a short moment - his first words were 'I am still here'"" - and the intense sadness, the despair was in the color of his eyes."|d1zcr3m|4029
It''s probably one of the most heart wrenching experiences of my life and stays with me still.|d1zcr3m|4030

"when things got really bad, I decided to do *it* by drinking lots of bug spray (stupid, i know but tbf I was really young then), after i took it, i did not get unconscious as expected, at first it felt nothing except an unusual taste in my mouth, but after a while, i got this strange feeling and I started vomiting n vomiting, just continuously.. after 2-3 hours when it finally stopped, my first thought was 'well that was a huge mistake'"" not because suddenly I wanted to live again, but because i failed.."|d1zmnu2|4034
It pained for, what it seems like, days now.|d1zmnu2|4035
[BK][BK][BK]That incident was really bad for me because every time i thought about killing myself, or even started to actually do it, i would get scared of failing again.|d1zmnu2|4036
i decided that I would not do it until I found a quick and painless way.|d1zmnu2|4037
[BK][BK][BK]after that, whenever I read, heard or came to know that someone had committed suicide, I was more curious about ''how'' rather than ''why'', but still years went by and no luck.|d1zmnu2|4038
That was until I saw the imitation game a few days back, searched online how he did it, and it said he used apple seeds.|d1zmnu2|4039
All these years I had this excuse of not having the means to do it and now that I have..|d1zmnu2|4040
I do not know..|d1zmnu2|4041
I mean things still have not gotten better, I still have no friends, no family, still in pain all the time, still a handicap.. still all alone.. and I do not want to be alone, not anymore.|d1zmnu2|4042
"I do not know if I can do this all alone..  im sorry I know this was not part of the question asked, but I just.. had to get it out. """|d1zmnu2|4043
I was depressed for as long as I can remember.|d1zmosa|4044
I was bullied by everyone around me and my parents were even worse.|d1zmosa|4045
By the time I was 10 I had had enough.|d1zmosa|4046
But I did not actually know how to go about it.|d1zmosa|4047
[BK][BK]I remembered hearing about someone killing themselves by taking pills.|d1zmosa|4048
I did not know what kind of pills would work.|d1zmosa|4049
I assumed any pills.|d1zmosa|4050
[BK]So while I was in the kitchen doing dishes one night I waited until both of my parents left the room and I quickly grabbed a bottle of something and shoved it in my pocket without looking.|d1zmosa|4051
[BK][BK]I had to wait until everyone went to sleep.|d1zmosa|4052
So I waited for hours until I was certain everyone was asleep and I crept into the bathroom.|d1zmosa|4053
We had those paper Dixie cups for rinsing your mouth out while you were brushing your teeth and I filled one up with water and opened the bottle and just started swallowing pills.|d1zmosa|4054
[BK][BK]Eventually my mom I guess heard something and started banging on the door and yelling at me to go to bed.|d1zmosa|4055
She was always trying to get me to practice putting on makeup even though I hated it.|d1zmosa|4056
So I started messing around with the makeup bag on the counter so she would not be able to hear me putting the remaining pills back in the bottle.|d1zmosa|4057
I opened the door and apologized and told her I was just trying on makeup like she wanted and she angrily told me to get into bed.|d1zmosa|4058
I layed down thinking I would finally be done with all of this by tomorrow.|d1zmosa|4059
[BK][BK]The next day I woke up.|d1zmosa|4060
"I immediately thought [BK]'I am not supposed to be here.'"""|d1zmosa|4061
And was filled with mostly dread, but also the tiniest bit of relief.|d1zmosa|4062
[BK][BK]Turns out the bottle I grabbed the night before was Midol.|d1zmosa|4063
I have no idea honestly to this day if that would have killed me or not had I finished the bottle.|d1zmosa|4064
My stomach hurt all day the next day and I thought that maybe because I did not take enough it was just a slow and drawn out death and I took some comfort in that.|d1zmosa|4065
"[BK]I am glad it did not now, even though I am still struggling with depression ten years later I am not suicidal anymore. """|d1zmosa|4066
Honestly I did not feel much of anything at all while vomiting for a good 6 hours.|d1y7ab9|4067
After it was all done I had convinced myself that I was just trying to get high.|d1y7ab9|4068
[BK][BK]It was a Fentanyl overdose.|d1y7ab9|4069
I had laboured breathing as I was slowly drifting away.|d1y7ab9|4070
I would smoke Fentanyl gel from a piece of foil, more and more as I drifted out.|d1y7ab9|4071
I noticed my breathing and the fact that after enough of an opiate, to overdose, you do not  feel much of anything at all.|d1y7ab9|4072
Not even euphoria.|d1y7ab9|4073
[BK][BK]Right now I am realizing that I had attempted suicide that day.|d1y7ab9|4074
I do not know how to feel about that...|d1y7ab9|4075
I went through a lot of emotions that night.|d1y7ern|4076
To be honest I am not sure quite how serious i was, or how much i was just looking for attention, but i took a good 2000mg of ibuprofen after drinking a good amount.|d1y7ern|4077
The utter emptiness, followed by the moment of regret and grief when it really settled in what i did, followed by a lot of inner strength emerging, and a hell of a lot of crying...[BK][BK]Well, i wish i could say i really did start getting better after that night but i dropped out after a break down a month and a half later.|d1y7ern|4078
I am so much better now|d1y7ern|4079
I am not quite sure.|d1y7dwy|4080
Mostly I had to make up a story to explain what happened to the fire fighters, police and emts.|d1y7dwy|4081
After that I was in  shock for a while and I guess my first aware thought about everything was how bad I screwed myself by failing and how badly I wished I had not.|d1y7dwy|4082
[BK][BK]Going through that has left me with permanent pain which I almost killed myself with alcohol because of.|d1y7dwy|4083
[BK][BK]But going through such a rough time, being rescued by complete strangers and friends alike has made me so appreciative and understanding of myself.|d1y7dwy|4084
I hate that I went through it, I hate that I still slip and struggle, but I am who I am today because of the shit I went through and I truely like who I am today.|d1y7dwy|4085
[BK][BK]If you feel down, depressed or just sad please talk to someone, anyone, I am here you can talk to me, there is the crisis help text line and so many resources.|d1y7dwy|4086

Can't sleep, so I might as well contribute.|d1y7ax0|4090
Although I was not able to ACTUALLY go through with it, I attempted suicide twice in middle school.|d1y7ax0|4091
I was generally hated, and suffered from extreme OCD, and had not had my meds fully worked out.|d1y7ax0|4092
The constant bullying, anger, and hurt never helps.|d1y7ax0|4093
Even today, I still suffer from OCD and depression, which amplify each other.|d1y7ax0|4094
Since middle school, I have forgotten much of what happened, and even I have even forgotten most of the details of my two attempts.|d1y7ax0|4095
I did learn that even if I did it, it would be a million times worse for those who cared about me.|d1y7ax0|4096
Even as depressed as I get today (which does not help after major spine surgery), I do not consider suicide an option.|d1y7ax0|4097
I could not hurt my family and friends like that.|d1y7ax0|4098
For those of you who are thinking about it, do not.|d1y7ax0|4099
It can get better.|d1y7ax0|4100
Although I am still not exactly fantastic, I can get through the pain.|d1y7ax0|4101
You can too.|d1y7ax0|4102
Fuck, I was like ten or eleven when I got through most of it.|d1y7ax0|4103
If a middle schooler who cannot grasp the concept of how others care about them made it, you can too.|d1y7ax0|4104
Stay strong.|d1y7ax0|4105
'Fuck.|d1y7gs1|4106
At least I made the noose properly.|d1y7gs1|4107
"Might as well call someone who can help.'"""|d1y7gs1|4108
I tried to hang myself, but the sturdiest thing I could find was not very sturdy, and so I found myself with glass and metal in my face and around my body when I woke up.|d1y7gs1|4109
I then got forced into a mental ward and kicked out of school.|d1y7gs1|4110
"They did not want a third suicide in a year at the university."""|d1y7gs1|4111
Posting this in the hopes that someone reads this and finds the strength they need.|d1zng1s|4112
[BK][BK]I was clinically depressed in high school because of a multitude of things but my parents never sought treatment for it because they thought that all I had to do was be happy and it would fix itself.|d1zng1s|4113
I had suicidal thoughts every single day and I would save the little packets from medicine bottles, food, etc.|d1zng1s|4114
that are supposed to keep the moisture out (silica gel) and put them in my drawer.|d1zng1s|4115
One day, after a terrible day at school, I came home and just....could not deal with it anymore.|d1zng1s|4116
I took out the 25 packets I had saved up over a few months, tore them open and swallowed them all.|d1zng1s|4117
"I mean, it said 'Do Not Eat'"" on them so I figured they would be poisonous."|d1zng1s|4118
When I finished swallowing them, I decided to go on MSN messenger and send my goodbyes to my friends.|d1zng1s|4119
I end up talking to one of my friends about the shit day he is having and that he is worried about his mom because she had to go to the hospital for surgery.|d1zng1s|4120
"I calm him down and he says the sentence that I will never forget, *'""Thanks for talking to me, I do not know what I would have done without you."|d1zng1s|4121
"'""*[BK]Without even typing a reply, I run straight to the bathroom and make myself throw up everything."|d1zng1s|4122
Now he is my best friend, going 7 years strong!|d1zng1s|4123

Oh Fuck!|d1y7h63|4125
[BK]I have to clean this mess of blood so nobody will notice I have tried and not even succeeded.|d1y7h63|4126
[BK]Its kinda sad that nobody even noticed it because I was so good at hiding.|d1y7h63|4127
[BK][BK]I made it through these dark times now, but I wish I would have talked to somebody a lot earlier!|d1y7h63|4128
[BK]Depression is a serious illness and you deserve this help, even if you do not feel you are worth it.|d1y7h63|4129

[BK]Please do not hide your feelings and talk to somebody!|d1y7h63|4131
[BK]Have a good day :)|d1y7h63|4132
I never got to attempt it, but I was days away from potentially trying.|d1y7k6a|4133
Counselors found out through a friend of mine that I was potentially planning to do it-- but even to this day I do not know what I would have done had the day came.|d1y7k6a|4134
I had planned to OD in the woods on OTC meds.|d1y7k6a|4135
[BK][BK]My first thought when they brought me in was that I knew I could not do it now no matter how I felt and that I just wanted to go back to class and forget that I had ever even thought about it.|d1y7k6a|4136
It also basically solidified me internalizing a lot of stuff that I still do to this day, because my friends still worry about me hurting myself more than 10 years later.|d1y7k6a|4137
Probably not the usual instant regret story.|d1zsu69|4138
After taking a bottle of anti-anxiety meds and washing them down with a bottle of vodka, my husband (boyfriend at the time) called an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital.|d1zsu69|4139
My best friend was by my side, and although I cannot remember anything she told me I kept crying and saying I wish I had died.|d1zsu69|4140
[BK][BK]The rest is also sort of blurry.|d1zsu69|4141
I remember having to call my parents and tell them what had happened.|d1zsu69|4142
At the time I was ashamed and could not get the words out when my mom picked up.|d1zsu69|4143
I asked for my twin sister, who then relayed the message to my parents.|d1zsu69|4144
She told me after I sounded like a stranger, I was talking at half the normal speed and was slurring so much I was near unintelligible.|d1zsu69|4145
[BK][BK]After convincing my family not to drive five hours to see me, I guess I passed out for a few more hours.|d1zsu69|4146
I was in and out of consciousness while they flushed my system.|d1zsu69|4147
[BK][BK]When I was disharged from the hospital, I was taken to the Waterford (mental hospital) where I waited for what seemed like forever (this is the same day, late at night now).|d1zsu69|4148
After talking to a psychologist for a couple of hours I was deemed stable enough to go home for some reason.|d1zsu69|4149
(he told me I was depressed, duh, with borderline tendencies) I think at this point my speech was still slurred, I definitely was not in my right mind.|d1zsu69|4150
But for some reason I was not kept overnight.|d1zsu69|4151
[BK][BK]So after about 16 hours I crawled back into my bed, same bedroom where I had decided to end my life.|d1zsu69|4152
I felt exhausted, ashamed, guilty, and scared.|d1zsu69|4153
I felt this way for days afterwards, but only relieved I was unsuccessful for the sake of my loved ones.|d1zsu69|4154
That feeling was mixed with guilt.|d1zsu69|4155
[BK][BK]Two years of recovery later and I still have recurring nightmares.|d1zsu69|4156
Not an experience I am willing to repeat.|d1zsu69|4157
But if I am being completely honest with myself, what I went through only made me determined not to fuck up if I tried again.|d1zsu69|4158
Luckily, I have no desire to do so in the immediate future, as I am in a good place right now mentally.|d1zsu69|4159

Funny how I had just tried to kill myself but I woke up wishing I had not because... needles.|d1y7o2r|4166
It made me realize that I did not actually want to die, but my brain and my illness led me to do so.|d1y7o2r|4167
[BK][BK]Mental illness is something I wish more people would understand.|d1y7o2r|4168
We want to die because some of our minds are too loud and we want peace and quiet just once.|d1y7o2r|4169
Or forever.|d1y7o2r|4170
What our brain makes us believe is that we are trapped and that we will never escape this ''noise''.|d1y7o2r|4171
But things eventually do quiet down, it just requires patience, time, and ultimately, willpower.|d1y7o2r|4172

He will not even speak to me anymore, but my friends have all told me he is worried sick, and I know he loves me a ton.|d24m42x|4197
I am sure my parents told him to give me space why I get healthy, and I wish he was here every second.|d24m42x|4198
With a clearer head (and a severe depression and anxiety diagnosis, along with medication) I realize that the pain would leave me and just manifest in those I love.|d24m42x|4199
I got a puppy and she helps on those bad days, but I miss my ex so much every second.|d24m42x|4200
It gets hard to breathe sometimes.|d24m42x|4201

"I tried to kill myself with 3 boxes of paracetamol which are meds for 'basic pain'"" but I learned that it could even kill somebody."|d2ih5ss|4203
I planned it well through.|d2ih5ss|4204
I was at the lowest in my life.|d2ih5ss|4205
"Being only 17 years old I was feeling kind of '""dramatical'"" but I did not care."|d2ih5ss|4206
[BK][BK][BK]But when I actually did it, I did not feel anything, I was taking the pills in doses and I was not looking back or feel bad.|d2ih5ss|4207
I did not feel bad about leaving my twin sister or leaving my parents.|d2ih5ss|4208
[BK]After about 3 hours my parents came home and unusually entered my room to me looking weird and not responding.|d2ih5ss|4209
I was not unconsious but just did not know what to say.|d2ih5ss|4210
[BK]After I told them they took me to the hospital right away.|d2ih5ss|4211
But the process and the behavior of some doctor resulted in making it another 3 hours before I had my stomach pumped out.|d2ih5ss|4212
[BK]Meanwhile my parents being told that the pumping will not save me and that they cannot tell If I will be alive in the morning or not.|d2ih5ss|4213
[BK][BK][BK]I spent the whole night throwing up black water and did not sleep at all.|d2ih5ss|4214
I was in the intense care unit and I hated the thought that I was still alive.|d2ih5ss|4215
And I hated that thought week later when I was finally leaving the ICU and moving to the children unit.|d2ih5ss|4216
And week later I still hated that thought when they moved into the psychiatric institution where I saw crazy girl banging her head and loudly yelling over and over that she want to go home(19y.o?)|d2ih5ss|4217
where I spent one week before I was moved to the children unit once again since there was no space.|d2ih5ss|4218
But to my suprise to this day, I did not proceed to do anything else..|d2ih5ss|4219
"I guess the one try '""weared'"" me out and I did not want to do in it a public place."|d2ih5ss|4220
[BK][BK][BK]But today, I can say, that the experience had changed my alot.|d2ih5ss|4221
Sometimes I think I am completely different and feel different.|d2ih5ss|4222
I am more confident, outgoing and do not feel ashamed of me as I did.|d2ih5ss|4223
Of course it was not over night, it took a year to feel better and till this day I suffer depression stages and asocial feelings and ashamed of myself.|d2ih5ss|4224
But I am really happy I am here and if anybody want to speak, I am always here and I do not intend to leave.|d2ih5ss|4225

Like all of you, this thread is worth saving.|d1ya6xs|4228
Be well, Redditors :-)|d1ya6xs|4229
When I was 17, I had already attempted suicide twice.|d1y4wza|4230
The final try ended up with me trying to drink myself to death.|d1y4wza|4231
I had so much alcohol in my system that I apparently vomited uncontrollably everywhere for several hours, cried non-stop and tried walking into traffic.|d1y4wza|4232
[BK][BK]I do not remember any of that - instead, my first memory was waking up in a hospital bed with several monitoring cables attached to my bare chest, trousers covered in puke and urine, and some kind of IV gadget in an arm.|d1y4wza|4233
My immediate reaction was to cry.|d1y4wza|4234
I knew I had missed the opportunity, I knew that I had failed even to take my own life, purely because I was (and remain) too scared to take a gun to my head or jump off a large height.|d1y4wza|4235
I cried my eyes out with what little energy I had left, frustrated and powerless, profoundly and irredeemably broken by the realisation that I have to continue living a life with severe depression and a post traumatic stress disorder that have crippled me.|d1y4wza|4236
[BK][BK]Things have not gotten better since then, but they have gotten easier.|d1y4wza|4237
Unfortunately there is no real way to solve these issues.|d1y4wza|4238
It's a shame we invest more money into warfare and conflict than health, and science as a whole.|d1y4wza|4239
'Jesus, how the hell am I still here?|d1ya6g1|4240

Commenting on this late so my reply will most likely get buried.|d4eai53|4244
Happens to also be my first comment.|d4eai53|4245
Anyway, I am not a survivor of suicide but I am a first hand account of a survivor of suicide from the beginning.|d4eai53|4246
[BK]I woke up on the morning of June 1st, 2014.|d4eai53|4247
It was a Sunday and I had work so I would have usually just gone straight into the bathroom but this day, this day was different.|d4eai53|4248
I could have never known on this day my life would be changed forever.|d4eai53|4249
when I woke up I had an overwhelming urge to check on my older brother(D) .|d4eai53|4250
House was too empty, both of my parents gone.|d4eai53|4251
It was not a panic sort of feeling but more of intuition that guided me through my house and straight downstairs.|d4eai53|4252
Now if you knew me you had know I do not really go down into our basement ever because that is kind of part of my dads living space.|d4eai53|4253
When I walked down there my worst nightmare came true, something no sister, mother, father or loved one should ever see.|d4eai53|4254
It was surreal as I saw My brother laying face down on the floor.|d4eai53|4255
I ran to him to turn him over and there was no pulse.|d4eai53|4256
I shot into panic mode, when the ambulance got there they rushed him to the hospital.|d4eai53|4257
Where he laid in the same bed for a week.|d4eai53|4258
I could not ever describe the pain I went through as I went to the hospital every day to see my brother.|d4eai53|4259
Seeing him laid up in a hospital bed with a machine that was breathing for him and all these tunes and wires that were helping him live.|d4eai53|4260
You see the thing is, he slipped into coma and no one knew how long he was going to be gone for.|d4eai53|4261
That week lasted a thousand years.|d4eai53|4262
I have never seen or felt the pain I experienced in that hospital room ever in my life and I hope to never feel it again.|d4eai53|4263
When the day came that he woke up, I happened to be walking into the room.|d4eai53|4264
He was already semi awake with a nurse in the room.|d4eai53|4265
"The nurse told him 'your sisters here to see you'"" and I think that is when he came back to reality."|d4eai53|4266
He was very confused at first about what happened, not remembering anything or how long he had been there.|d4eai53|4267
"He seemed upset at the fact that he was in coma but he just kept saying '""I wish I would have never lived'"" '""why did you have to find me'"" I felt an immense feeling at that moment."|d4eai53|4268
It really does something to you when you find someone you love no longer breathing, when they wake up and tell you they still do not want to live is even harder.|d4eai53|4269
Good news is to this day he is still here.|d4eai53|4270
Bad news is, it still effects me And our family will never be the same.|d4eai53|4271
"He still says things like '""I wish you would have never found me'"" suicide hurts the ones you love more then anyone could ever begin to comprehend."|d4eai53|4272
"I do not wish it on anyone."""|d4eai53|4273
I have not actually attempted to do anything, however I have a gun that I have been keeping under my pillow.|d6npzhm|4274
I have held it to my head a few times just to see if I could picture myself pulling the trigger.|d6npzhm|4275
I am not proud to admit that.|d6npzhm|4276
I have been having extreme anxiety for the past six months because my partner of three and a half years left me, and I have been dealing with health issues.|d6npzhm|4277
Because of the line of work I am in, I have to be careful of showing any mental health problems.|d6npzhm|4278
The person whose position I filled actually took their own life several years ago.|d6npzhm|4279
[BK][BK]I feel myself slipping away, at first it was slow, and now it has amped up.|d6npzhm|4280
I barely sleep and my thoughts race a lot of the time.|d6npzhm|4281
For awhile I was on Xanax, but that stuff is addicting and I made myself stop taking it.|d6npzhm|4282
[BK][BK]I am having trouble coping with the loss of my relationship, and the loss of my sanity.|d6npzhm|4283
My body cannot take any more stress, as it only makes my health issues worse.|d6npzhm|4284
[BK][BK]The gun is under my pillow.|d6npzhm|4285
I have it loaded with two hollow point bullets.|d6npzhm|4286
I do not know where I would actually do it, because I would not want to around my dog and cats.|d6npzhm|4287
[BK][BK]I have had to make myself almost blank out lately, because if I look at my mom, who is my best friend, it makes this so much harder.|d6npzhm|4288
[BK][BK]I am ready to go.|d6npzhm|4289
I am tired.|d6npzhm|4290
I know a lot of people will probably be hurt, but I do not have the energy to live for other people anymore.|d6npzhm|4291

I was hooked up to several machines.|d1y7th6|4302
My heart and lungs/breathing were being monitored.|d1y7th6|4303
Also had an IV.|d1y7th6|4304
There was always a hospital staff member in the room at all times.|d1y7th6|4305
I remember kissing my children good bye (they were 2 & 3 years old at the time) and taking a bottle of sedatives.|d1y7th6|4306
My husband at the time called 911.|d1y7th6|4307
I remember laying down to sleep in my bed and wanting to never wake up.|d1y7th6|4308
They were not sure of the pill count at the time or of how many I ingested.|d1y7th6|4309

I felt sick so I went upstairs and discovered that three days had gone by, I was poofy, and my father had not noticed that I was you know, not exactly alive or okay.|d1y2o25|4319
He did not even know if I was in the house.|d1y2o25|4320
[BK][BK]I moved out on my own not long after.|d1y2o25|4321
I was 16.|d1y2o25|4322
[BK][BK]I did not regret trying and I did not vow never to do it again.|d1y2o25|4323

[BK][BK]When I woke up next, with my mom having taken care of me with the stomach virus she thought I had, I cannot put into words exactly what I thought.|d1y53uu|4347
It was a combination of guilt that my mom cared, depression that I could not even do this right, and a resolve that I would never do this again.|d1y53uu|4348

Ooohhh, something I can contribute to!|d1y6f2b|4443
[BK][BK]Anyways, I guess I was happy I was being taken seriously for my illness after that.|d1y6f2b|4444
I was turned away a few days before my attempt when I said I needed help, as they said the only thing they could really do is give me a bed, and that they could not really help me.|d1y6f2b|4445
[BK][BK]The issue with clinical depression/anxiety disorder is, if you have had it a while, you do not look depressed.|d1y6f2b|4446
You get used to hiding it, to the point where you cannot really get across the idea that you need help to someone who probably comes across a bunch of teens who are going through a phase... so you need to do something drastic to be taken seriously.|d1y6f2b|4447
[BK][BK]I know while I was in the ambulance and still thought I was going to die that it was the most relaxed I would ever been in my life.|d1y6f2b|4448
I did not have to fight anymore, it was over, and I could just sit back and let it happen.|d1y6f2b|4449
Looks like im here to stay.|d1y8be0|4450
[BK][BK]Ate a shit ton of sleeping pills and ended up just vomiting on the carpet and shoes.|d1y8be0|4451
Dogs came,foster mom found me on the floor with the mess I made to myself, took me to a doctor, got sent to a shrink for two years.|d1y8be0|4452
Told them I wouldnt do it again, it seems too easy and honestly I would like to see more of what life has to offer.|d1y8be0|4453
within those two years I met my closest friends, there is more to life than in death.|d1y8be0|4454
It's a weird answer for me because I was not in my right mind when I attempted.|d1y8bx6|4455
The intent was there, but also the world was not really real and things did not really matter and I was probably kind of invincible anyway?|d1y8bx6|4456
[BK][BK]So I actually was happily succeeding until I came down from the crazy a little bit and realised I had a number of hours left before organ failure would be beyond the point of no return, at which point I decided to go to hospital.|d1y8bx6|4457
[BK][BK]Once I would finished listening to the album I was, of course.|d1y8bx6|4458
(Like I said, not right mind.|d1y8bx6|4459
)[BK][BK]I did not find out I was actually going to live for another 24 hours after that.|d1y8bx6|4460
I think I just focused on the practical - I needed to get a taxi home, so that the friend who knew I was there would know I was safe.|d1y8bx6|4461
[BK][BK]I do remember though that, even after deliberately surviving, I *hated* myself for months afterwards for failing.|d1y8bx6|4462

Quack doctor was treating me for depression.|d1yepcb|4480

I was just getting wise so he kept upping the dosage.|d1yepcb|4482

She had left to go shopping and should not have been back for hours.|d1yepcb|4485

I never actually made an attempt myself, but I did get very close a few times.|d1y8fq4|4502
I did not feel connected to anyone, I had no one I felt I could talk to, no one that would understand, always kept on the outside.|d1y8fq4|4503
[BK][BK]But one day it just clicked for me that it had be the most selfish thing I could do.|d1y8fq4|4504
That if I did commit suicide then I would be putting the people I care about and the people that cared about me (whether I knew they did or not) through the same thing or so much worse, and I just could not do that.|d1y8fq4|4505
[BK][BK]And I may not be happy all the time now by any means, but even when things suck the most, I just think, 'These people here still need me.|d1y8fq4|4506

My bro and I are super close, and having to look everyone in the face after all the shit I put them through because of the shit I did thanks to depression.|d1y8ew1|4512
For anybody wondering, I had depression which led to insomnia, and all the shrinks and psychiatrists just gave me one pill after another, for sleep and depression, and that ended in me abusing them pretty hard, and mixing them with alcohol.|d1y8ew1|4513
It turned into an almost daily thing.|d1y8ew1|4514
OD''d pretty hard on that stuff.|d1y8ew1|4515

Then mad that I had failed, but mostly I hurt and I was throwing up over and over.|d1y3377|4520
Turns out my opiate tolerance was too strong for the amount of heroin I chose (about 3/4ths of a gram).|d1y3377|4521
In the weeks after I thought about what a failure I was for not just using the shotgun, and sometimes I still do.|d1y3377|4522
Well, lots of the time.|d1y3377|4523
I am working on it, but the feelings are not gone.|d1y3377|4524

I woke up really confused and tried to remember what I was just doing; hanging myself.|d1y6ge0|4528
[BK][BK]I was 19 and was 6 months into sobriety after rehab, living with a minister who was a second mom to me.|d1y6ge0|4529
She and her husband were on a cruise and her older son was celebrating his birthday that day.|d1y6ge0|4530
I decided that the world had given up on me, breaking up with my addict boyfriend is what I needed to do... And could not handle it.|d1y6ge0|4531
[BK][BK]I called my then boyfriend and he was so upset he told me not to tell anybody and that he could help me.|d1y6ge0|4532
I knew he was wrong and that was not love.|d1y6ge0|4533
[BK]I called my councillor from rehab/my addictions group and she literally drove across town and took me to the hospital.|d1y6ge0|4534
I had purple marking all around my neck, skinned my spine along something when the rope I hung myself with broke while I was unconscious.|d1y6ge0|4535
[BK]We decided going back to rehab for 3 months was the best, and I had no neck injuries from my hanging.|d1y6ge0|4536
[BK][BK]I am not going to say it was easy, I broke up with that boyfriend, stayed single for over a year, worked on my recovery, and attended what I had always wanted in college: animation.|d1y6ge0|4537
[BK][BK]It is now 3 years later in my sobriety and almost 3 years since, and I start my final year of animation in September.|d1y6ge0|4538
I am also dating a wonderful and truly loving man who is not afraid to tell me the truth and helps me best he can; with REAL love.|d1y6ge0|4539
I have a fantastic relationship with my rehab group, family, and the minister whom I lived with.|d1y6ge0|4540
I sometimes have hard days but am moving farther away from thoughts of suicide because I really truly cannot bear to hurt the people I love so much in my life today.|d1y6ge0|4541
[BK][BK]Please do not give up!|d1y6ge0|4542
Don't end your life over a boy, or over anybody in your life.|d1y6ge0|4543

Just the way the noose came untied from the beam... it does not make since to me sometimes.|d1y6rfa|4558
I am happy to be alive but sometimes I think I am crazy to excite the possibility that the entire reality I exist in right now is not one just conjured up by my brain in a last ditch effort to show me what could had been.|d1y6rfa|4559

I do not remember the walk there so much.|d1y6owx|4594
Just kinda remember being there.|d1y6owx|4595
[BK][BK]The tracks were only a half mile away from my house, and about 200 or so feet down the road on the tracks became entirely shrouded due to trees and whatnot.|d1y6owx|4596
So nobody driving by would be able to see even as much as my silhouette.|d1y6owx|4597
Perfect way to die.|d1y6owx|4598

The first go right, the second go left, and the third just has stray carts.|d1y6owx|4601
[BK][BK]I waited between the first and second ones, and saw a train coming from about 3 miles away (it may be surrounded by trees, but it is a straight shot and I can see the light).|d1y6owx|4602
It was going right, so I sat upright, facing away from it on the first set of tracks.|d1y6owx|4603
I felt no nervousness, no fear, nothing.|d1y6owx|4604
Just total apathy.|d1y6owx|4605
[BK][BK]Then the train passed me.|d1y6owx|4606
And I almost immediately sobered up, or at least enough to remember everything entirely clearly.|d1y6owx|4607
"[BK][BK]I then thought to myself  '""Well, I tried, back home I go.'"""|d1y6owx|4608

After the 7th unsuccessful time (during my pre-teen and teen years) I knew if God did not want to take me back, he must have placed me here in this world for a reason and so I decided to stop messing with that 'reason'[BK][BK]I am still here and man I still struggle every single day, but I see my family (what is left of it), some of my good friends (what is left of them) and I think about my good health and I try to hold onto those small happy factors and I guess I am not great, but I am good and that is okay.|d1ya5ev|4617

I am doing better.|d1y6vis|4686
I had missed a lot of school prior to that, because I was running away from home a lot.|d1y6vis|4687
Once I got back, the work I had to make up was extremely overwhelming.|d1y6vis|4688
Junior year is already stressful, but my home life has been far worse.|d1y6vis|4689
I did not even think I could graduate and would get kicked out of private school.|d1y6vis|4690
Home still is not better, but the fact that now I have a license and the thought of being 18 in just months from now is giving me hope.|d1y6vis|4691
I chose to forgo therapy for the rest of the year since I need all the time I can to do especially well in school for the rest of the year to make up for how shitty I did, but I am also reconsidering.|d1y6vis|4692

The round had a bad primer(junk rounds from walmart).|d1y8xvn|4696
I didnt sleep for a week after that, then after watching the sun rise and set everyday that week my numbness stopped..|d1y8xvn|4697
I broke down sobbing and crying and switching between crying and laughing hysterically for hours on end.|d1y8xvn|4698
Then I crashed hard for two days.|d1y8xvn|4699
Slept like a baby.|d1y8xvn|4700
[BK][BK]My experience came with some type of clarity that I really cant explain..|d1y8xvn|4701
I can only say it gave me an understanding and tranquility about my own existence that I carry to this day.|d1y8xvn|4702

well mine was simple ''if at first you do not succeed try again''|d1y8u2g|4717
The very first thing I remember is waking up and shaking in the middle of the night.|d1y6vjw|4718
I could not control it and I just hoped I would go back to sleep and the pills would take effect.|d1y6vjw|4719
The next morning I woke up and the first thing I did was start to cry.|d1y6vjw|4720
It had been another thing I failed at, another thing I was not good enough at doing.|d1y6vjw|4721
It just further solidified to me that I was a fuck up.|d1y6vjw|4722
[BK][BK]That day was pretty rough for me - I went to school and acted like nothing happened and during my free period called a suicide hotline.|d1y6vjw|4723
Honestly, it took a lot of will and strength not to try again that night and I am happy I did not.|d1y6vjw|4724
Basically, the way I looked at it was I would hit rock bottom.|d1y6vjw|4725
This was going to be my lowest low and there would not be anything that would make me feel worse, so I may as well give life another shot.|d1y6vjw|4726
[BK][BK]This was about 7 years ago now and I have put my suicidal thoughts behind me, but it was a struggle.|d1y6vjw|4727
My first psychiatrist diagnosed me as bipolar and I was on the wrong medication up until college when I had to take a medical leave my second semester and finally saw a new doctor when I got home.|d1y6vjw|4728
[BK][BK]A couple years ago I got off anti-depressants entirely and I think that is something people do not really realize you can do (I know my mom did not understand it).|d1y6vjw|4729
Sure, it is not for everyone, but in my case I was in a completely different situation at the time of my attempt and the worst of my depression.|d1y6vjw|4730
When I got off my meds I was probably 5 years older, going to college, around a new group of people, even in a different state.|d1y6vjw|4731
To me, it was worth it to go through a monitored withdrawal to see if I could function normally without them.|d1y6vjw|4732
That said, there is nothing wrong with people who do need to continue to take them for longer periods of time.|d1y6vjw|4733
Fuck.|d1y6we1|4734
Who found me?|d1y6we1|4735
I hope it was not my parents.|d1y6we1|4736
They would be devastated.|d1y6we1|4737
Wait.|d1y6we1|4738
I am not at the hospital.|d1y6we1|4739
Why is my room so clean.|d1y6we1|4740
WHERE THE FUCK ARE MY RAZERS??|d1y6we1|4741
Damn my neck hurts like a bitch.|d1y6we1|4742
How did I end up in my bed?|d1y6we1|4743
Shit it is 10am I missed school!|d1y6we1|4744
My mom is going to kill me.|d1y6we1|4745
Why the fuck could I not just be left alone to die?|d1y6we1|4746
[BK][BK][BK][BK]I hung myself.|d1y6we1|4747
My brother said he heard something and came to check on me.|d1y6we1|4748
(I used to tell my brother all about sports med classes so he knows how to check vitals) so he cut the rope, I was passed out but had a strong heart beat and he did not notice anything wrong with my breathing.|d1y6we1|4749
So he picked me up and put me in bed.|d1y6we1|4750
He said I woke up shortly after but he told me to go to sleep.|d1y6we1|4751
"'I will tell mom you feel like shit and you should stay home from school'""[BK][BK]The reason he did not take me to the hospital was because we both know that my mom does not know how to deal with these things."|d1y6we1|4752
She makes these things worse.|d1y6we1|4753
It''s not her fault.|d1y6we1|4754
But she does.|d1y6we1|4755
He knew I was okay and breathing and I was semi conscious.|d1y6we1|4756
"(Not smart but I thank him for it)[BK][BK]Me and my brother have always '""hated'"" each other."|d1y6we1|4757
We fight a lot and we both find each other annoying.|d1y6we1|4758
But after that.|d1y6we1|4759
It''s never been the same.|d1y6we1|4760
We have gotten so close since then.|d1y6we1|4761
We just took a vacation to Vegas.|d1y6we1|4762

Someone they trust.|d1y6we1|4767
"Don''t be the person to run and tell everyone that they are suicidal."""|d1y6we1|4768
Shit, I was so messed up around that time I actually did not remember I had done it until I had been sober for a few months.|d1y6xta|4769
I was fucking horrified.|d1y6xta|4770
[BK][BK]I was really bad off on some stuff after my kid''s mom left me.|d1y6xta|4771
In a haze one night, I swallowed the rest of my bottle of Tylenol PM, about 15 extra strength pills.|d1y6xta|4772
I woke up maybe 16 hours later and went to work.|d1y6xta|4773
I saw the pill bottle on the coffee table but it just did not really click.|d1y6xta|4774
I mean, I knew what I had done.|d1y6xta|4775
I guess I cannot really explain it.|d1y6xta|4776
I just kind of put it in the back of my mind and went about my shattered life.|d1y6xta|4777
[BK][BK]I checked into rehab a few weeks later after an extremely painful detox, got sober, and became happy again.|d1y6xta|4778
I vividly remember the day I finally felt the warmth of the sun on my skin again.|d1y6xta|4779
About two months after checking in, I was at a meeting and someone was talking about their suicide attempt.|d1y6xta|4780
Everything came flooding back and hit my like a ton of bricks.|d1y6xta|4781
I had to leave the room to regain my composure.|d1y6xta|4782
[BK][BK]It took another two years before I told someone: my kid''s mom.|d1y6xta|4783
She was being really ugly to me about something I had said or done and I begged her to stop.|d1y6xta|4784
She was telling me that I was vile and disgusting and she never wanted to see me again.|d1y6xta|4785
She told me that everyday for the past 3 years she regretted having a child with me.|d1y6xta|4786
Our beautiful son.|d1y6xta|4787
She said if it was up to her, they would move far away and I would never see either of them again.|d1y6xta|4788
She said loving me wa the biggest mistake she had ever made, and that she hated that I was the father of her child.|d1y6xta|4789
That she shivers at the thought of me being in the same room with her.|d1y6xta|4790
That I will never so much as hug her again.|d1y6xta|4791
We have not made physical contact since, and she is visibly uncomfortable every time I am around.|d1y6xta|4792
[BK][BK]Anyway, I begged her to stop saying those things.|d1y6xta|4793
In the confusion of what was happening, I told her that the last time she treated me this way, I tried to kill myself.|d1y6xta|4794
I regret that.|d1y6xta|4795
"She called me a 'fucking liar.'"""|d1y6xta|4796
[BK][BK]After a little while, I guess she believed me.|d1y6xta|4797
She told me if I was going to kill myself to please do it right now, before our son was old enough to remember me.|d1y6xta|4798
[BK][BK]I do not hold it against her.|d1y6xta|4799
Her mother had just died, her boyfriend had just cheated on her while her father was in town visiting after the funeral.|d1y6xta|4800
She had also just lost her job.|d1y6xta|4801
I really do not think I caused her to say those things.|d1y6xta|4802
She actually called a week later and apologized for saying all that to me.|d1y6xta|4803
I thanked her for the apology, but foolishly asked if she was just apologizing for hurting me or if she actually meant it.|d1y6xta|4804
She apologized for hurting me.|d1y6xta|4805
[BK][BK]Edit: I am sorry, that is really long.|d1y6xta|4806
I did not mean to write so much.|d1y6xta|4807

"I have only told one person, she did not believe me. """|d1y6xta|4810
When I was 15 I tried to overdose on my brothers sleeping medication.|d1y90ut|4811
"I took 40 or so pills (and I threw up some of them an hour later or so because my friend convinced me to)[BK][BK]I remember waking up and thinking along the lines of faking sick so I did not have to go to work experience for the day, but my mum came in to wake me up and saw all the pill packets and my 'I am sorry'"" note and called an ambulance."|d1y90ut|4812
[BK][BK]On the way the paramedics tried to keep me awake, but I just ignored them and went back to sleep.|d1y90ut|4813
In fact I spent most of the day and a half hospital stay asleep.|d1y90ut|4814
The only times I did wake up was when my dad visited with muffins, and overnight where I constantly had to get out of bed to pee.|d1y90ut|4815
[BK][BK]In some ways I am glad I did not die that day because I went on to meet some amazing people and have some really unique experiences.|d1y90ut|4816
"[BK][BK]This event shaped me for the better I believe though, I got the help I needed, I got my diagnoses of Aspergers, depression and anxiety which helped me to realise why it was so hard for me to relate to people."""|d1y90ut|4817
After my first (and luckily only) attempt at suicide I woke up scared sad and glad that I was alive...|d1y92yj|4818
I had taken a mix of pills trying to kill myself but I guess dosage was not enough for more than just making me pass out (I am fat I guess it saved me) I still think back about it and honestly I am glad it did not work.|d1y92yj|4819
After that I remember being sick, whether it was mental or physical from the pills I am not sure.|d1y92yj|4820
Never went to the hospital or told my parents.|d1y92yj|4821
Bummer.|d1ydzad|4822
"'damn it'"""""|d1zfic6|4823
I took almost 3 bottles of extra strength Advil, my parents dragged me to the hospital after I tried to just go to sleep.|d1y6zm2|4824
My first conscious thought after I attempted it and realized I failed is that no one believed me.|d1y6zm2|4825
I was sitting in the hospital bed with an IV in after blood and urine tests and all of them came back negative.|d1y6zm2|4826
[BK][BK]Everyone thought I did it just for attention and called me stupid, I did not and do not understand how none of it was picked up by the tests.|d1y6zm2|4827
[BK][BK]I was only 14 and I realized how stupid I was, when all of my friends from my football team were sitting in the lobby close to tears or crying.|d1y6zm2|4828
It was very emotional.|d1y6zm2|4829
My entire school started a hashtag 'praying' for my good health.|d1y6zm2|4830
[BK][BK]I ended up staying in a Psych Ward for a month in a nearby hospital.|d1y6zm2|4831
I was constantly thinking I was okay, and that it was a stupid idea.|d1y6zm2|4832
Still no one believed me, I cried when they let my mom visit for 15 minutes and I just hugged her.|d1y6zm2|4833
[BK][BK]The other people in there showed me how much worse other people had it.|d1y6zm2|4834
They all constantly told me in their free time that my life was perfect, I had so much, and why would I do what I did.|d1y6zm2|4835
I would tell them just how I felt (how at the time I would just think deeply about there really being no point to existence) but, none of them could quite grasp how I was feeling.|d1y6zm2|4836
[BK][BK]TLDR; I felt confused.|d1y6zm2|4837
I did not understand why no one believed what I said just because I tried to commit suicide.|d1y6zm2|4838
And I had my eyes opened to how much worse people had it.|d1y6zm2|4839
[BK][BK]Edit: I am now accepted into my local colleges Nursing program, I want to return the favor, and save peoples lives.|d1y6zm2|4840
If anyone needs someone to talk to I am here for you!|d1y6zm2|4841

I was upset that I would totaled my car and I was desperately trying to find a way to drive it home without having to call the police or a tow truck.|d1y73qx|4843
No such luck.|d1y73qx|4844
I do not have a cellphone with service so I could only call 911.|d1y73qx|4845
After I called I realized I would need a story and so I told the cop my tire blew out (which it had, after impact) and he seemed to believe me fine.|d1y73qx|4846
Didn't even ask if I would been drinking or anything (which I had not been).|d1y73qx|4847
[BK][BK]This was a about a month ago, give or take a few days, and it was the easily the lowest point in my life mentally.|d1y73qx|4848
I have been recovering really well.|d1y73qx|4849
My car was not actually totaled, it just needed a good few parts and a couple tires and it was right as rain.|d1y73qx|4850
[BK][BK]I think I needed to get that low before I could really start recovering.|d1y73qx|4851
I do not know.|d1y73qx|4852
It's always darkest before the dawn, they say.|d1y73qx|4853
[BK][BK]It's strange how this is not even close to being the worst part of my life and yet it is been so impossible shaking the misery.|d1y73qx|4854
Mental illness has been so fucked up and I am so glad I seem to be getting past it.|d1y73qx|4855
Regret, not about trying but rather not succeeding I actually became much more depressed  that I was still alive and this furthered more desire to die more at the time.|d1y9824|4856
[BK][BK]If I may offer any advice to anyone considering taking their life.|d1y9824|4857
I have been there and all I ask of you is to try to make your life better through any means possible first.|d1y9824|4858
You feel like you have nothing to lose right?|d1y9824|4859
So you also have nothing to lose if you seek help.|d1y9824|4860
I thought the shotgun was loaded.|d1y985e|4861
I thought I had loaded it months ago.|d1y985e|4862

I am still avoiding my family because of how deep the cuts are.|d1y985e|4864
I texted two people 30 minutes after I took all the pills.|d1y70x7|4865
100 or so nexium (threw up so I did not finish them all), some antibiotics (like 40 total?|d1y70x7|4866
), 20 zofran, 30 propranolol.|d1y70x7|4867
Avoided antidepressants.|d1y70x7|4868
Went to bed, woke up 4 hrs later and I knew I failed, was in a lot of pain, throwing up, dizzy and loss of balance.|d1y70x7|4869
Texted them never mind.|d1y70x7|4870
[BK][BK]Went to class, throwing up semi often but never in an actual class.|d1y70x7|4871
I had a very metallic taste from flagyl, so I could not eat or drink, and if I did it had be thrown up in an hour anyways.|d1y70x7|4872
Talked to my professors via email about missing an exam since I realized I wanted to live and was given another chance (my first OD was in 2014 but with much less medicine).|d1y70x7|4873
I remember talking magnesium citrate hoping it had flush out the stuff and I would be okay, tried brushing my teeth for the taste and threw it all up instantly.|d1y70x7|4874
Breathing hurt, abdominal region was in a lot of pain (I already had abdominal pain, just worse).|d1y70x7|4875
Went to ER, got a bunch of tests and I did not mention ODing to anyone.|d1y70x7|4876
They gave me IV zofran so I would stop puking, and provided me with fluids and after 20 hours I got to eat real food.|d1y70x7|4877
[BK][BK]Never told anyone until now what actually happened, I had a bunch of the symptoms prior because of something else, so the OD just made it a bit worse.|d1y70x7|4878
I also apparently killed the h. pylori infection I had since I am now negative for it, but I am still here somehow, so I have been trying to make something out of it.|d1y70x7|4879
Not sure if it counts but fuck it.|d1y8lc8|4880

[BK][BK]I OD''d on OTC pain meds, but for many years prior I was abusing them.|d1y73a5|4900
I saw it as something I could control.|d1y73a5|4901
Something special because no one realized I was doing it.|d1y73a5|4902
No on realized I tried to kill myself until years after when I finally told them.|d1y73a5|4903
It was hurtful.|d1y73a5|4904
I have a crappy family.|d1y73a5|4905
They did not even believe me when I told them.|d1y73a5|4906
They thought I was lying to get attention.|d1y73a5|4907
After everything I have been through, after everything they have put me through and they thought it was an attention grab.|d1y73a5|4908
[BK][BK]I absolutely hated them.|d1y73a5|4909
The hate lessens and then it pops back up and makes me miserable again.|d1y73a5|4910
It does not help I am still living with them because of my depression and anxiety.|d1y73a5|4911
I have no one else.|d1y73a5|4912
No other family.|d1y73a5|4913
I distanced myself from friends and after HS we lost contact.|d1y73a5|4914
[BK][BK]Anyways, I remember the day after because I woke up with the worst stomach ache and it lasted for days.|d1y73a5|4915
I remember getting online and finding out Heath Ledger died of an OD the same night.|d1y73a5|4916
(this was the day after) As weird as it sounds, I thought it was my fault.|d1y73a5|4917
That I had caused it.|d1y73a5|4918
So I felt even more guilty.|d1y73a5|4919
I went to tell my sister that HL died and she just blew it off.|d1y73a5|4920
I was soaking in tears and she did not understand why I was so upset.|d1y73a5|4921
[BK][BK]And before this moment, I never got into admiring celebrities, so it was really off for me to be so emotional when he died.|d1y73a5|4922
[BK][BK]I still do not have the answer.|d1y73a5|4923
I am still depressed and anxious.|d1y73a5|4924
I still am surrounded by horrible people.|d1y73a5|4925
Uncertain of my future.|d1y73a5|4926
It is just horrible.|d1y73a5|4927
I do not ever see myself being happy again.|d1y73a5|4928
I cannot go to the doctor because I do not have insurance and because of my anxiety.|d1y73a5|4929

Ever the perfectionist, plagued with an eating disorder, I always had that panic that I would lose control and fail - and suddenly, that person was not strong enough to torture me.|d1y76un|4944
I was a child again.|d1y76un|4945
It felt like a gentle electric hum was surrounding my hearing, I drifted off into a faraway memory I never thought was there, to where I was a kiddy and safe and sound and loved, no rape, no starving, no failures...and I stayed there.|d1y76un|4946
[BK]Then I jerked myself back, I have no idea how.|d1y76un|4947
"I know that one moment I was safe and '""not there'"" so to speak with that gentle hum that felt like a caress on the mind, the other the world was suddenly real, chaotic, raw."|d1y76un|4948
"Primal instincts set in, like '""pain pain scared scared not safe get help cold so cold sick smells bad throat aches taste copper'"" and then...just so much regret."|d1y76un|4949
"Just constantly repeating '""I am sorry, daddy, I am so sorry.'"""|d1y76un|4950
""""|d1y76un|4951
'My parents are going to be pissed'[BK][BK]They where.|d1y9nq2|4952
"'Well, that did not work.'"""""|d1y9p6u|4953
"'shit, what do I do now?'"""|d1y9p7i|4954
"[BK][BK]got up and drank what must have been a litre of water"""|d1y9p7i|4955
I slipped off the stool, panicked, found my footing again, was very relieved.|d1y9pru|4956
I was very lucky once I slipped off the stool.|d1y9pru|4957
One afternoon I thought I surpassed my limit .|d1y9qdo|4958
My plan was to hang myself in my uni accommodation using a belt .I set it up and was stood on a chair ready to kick it out from underneath but I did not .|d1y9qdo|4959
I stood there with this belt tight around my neck as memories flooded my mind , I was stood there for nearly half hour just thinking completely ignoring the belt around my neck , I realised it was not what I wanted and I could fix it .|d1y9qdo|4960
As I was undoing the belt I slipped and the chair nearly went over but I somehow managed to get the belt loose enough for me to get my head and collapsed on to the chair safe.|d1y9qdo|4961
I left uni after that , never told my friends or family because they did not need to know .|d1y9qdo|4962
Well I originally thought I was going to drink myself to death with anything, and I did that but it did not work.|d1yadv1|4963
So, randomly, I picked up reading more and was starting to get hooked on books.|d1yadv1|4964
This is probably what saved me form trying again.|d1yadv1|4965
"'Did anyone see that?'"""|d1ya97o|4966
[BK][BK]* As my rifle jammed at a shooting line up when i was pointing at my head.|d1ya97o|4967
[BK][BK]I looked to my left: *guy looking forward at target*[BK][BK]I looked to the right: *guy looking forward at target*[BK][BK]Me: Lift my foot up to signal my gun jammed, Lieutenant arrives to fix my gun and stands behind me for the rest of the shooting.|d1ya97o|4968
[BK]- I just could not imagine getting caught trying to shoot myself but my gun jamming.|d1ya97o|4969
THANK FUCKING GOD i did not get caught attempting suicide.|d1ya97o|4970
Later that day talked to the Commander and told him I want out.|d1ya97o|4971
"I am alive and well now. """|d1ya97o|4972
Took all of my brothers prescribed sleeping pills and put on some music.|d1yakt1|4973
Woke up in the hospital to him yelling at me about having to gt a new prescription.|d1yakt1|4974
The one most memorable time that I had attempted suicide, I had put the end of a shotgun barrel in my mouth after cocking the slide, pulled the trigger and *click*... Heart was racing so bad that I damn near died of a heart attack... A few hours later, after calming down, I checked the shotgun, cocked the slide again and a shell came out...|d1y7709|4975
Turns out, the shell was a repacked/reload and it failed to fire... My first thought after that was 'Holy shit...|d1y7709|4976
"I literally just fucking failed at something that was SO simple...'"" I then proceded to cry for a few hours."|d1y7709|4977
Got a phone call from a friends mom that I had not seen in years (the friend and his mom were very near and dear to my heart) and she asked me to pass it down the line that he had shot himself and ended his life and he had left in his suicide note that I was to be contacted...|d1y7709|4978
I literally had no words...[BK]I feel so fucking horrible that he and I attempted suicide on the same night at about the same time and I am the one who came out of it unscathed... Not sure if I should feel bad for him or for myself...|d1y7709|4979
"Still to this day, at times I feel as though I should be dead and he should still be alive... he had 2 kids and he was a wonderful father where as I myself had/still have no kids and I am a waste of space... :("""|d1y7709|4980
My first attempt, I took some pills.|d1y9rtw|4981
I did not bother to see what kind they were.|d1y9rtw|4982
I just grabbed them and downed them.|d1y9rtw|4983
I was in shock over something I had done.|d1y9rtw|4984
It was more of a I cannot believe I did that, I should be punished moment than a clear cut I want to die moment.|d1y9rtw|4985
I had meant to slap my ex.|d1y9rtw|4986
Our daughter was right beside him.|d1y9rtw|4987
I pulled my hand back to slap him.|d1y9rtw|4988
I was really pissed off.|d1y9rtw|4989
In rage, my hand turned into a fist.|d1y9rtw|4990
He moved our daughter to the area the fist was aiming for.|d1y9rtw|4991
I almost hit her instead.|d1y9rtw|4992
I stopped myself just in time.|d1y9rtw|4993
[BK][BK]He said he was going to call the cops and report me for abuse.|d1y9rtw|4994
I was freaking out and took the pills.|d1y9rtw|4995
I guess I really did not want to die.|d1y9rtw|4996
A couple minutes later, I told him what I had done.|d1y9rtw|4997
He took our daughter to our neighbors and drove me to the hospital.|d1y9rtw|4998
After my stomach was pumped, my first thoughts were I never want to do this again.|d1y9rtw|4999
I felt that way though because I hated the pump.|d1y9rtw|5000
Not a pleasant experience.|d1y9rtw|5001
That scared me enough to never do it again.|d1y9rtw|5002
Once I was thinking more clearly, I realized I did not want to die because I did not want my daughter to live with the knowledge her mother killed herself.|d1y9rtw|5003
"'I am such a fucking idiot'""[BK][BK]I jumped in front of a car, but I was too scared to really do it properly."|d1y9tlh|5004
I went early, and the car slowed down enough that I was not seriously hurt.|d1y9tlh|5005
I got up straight away and ran, just felt like such an idiot and was really glad I was okay only because the guy in the car did not deserve to suffer the consequences of my actions.|d1y9tlh|5006
Then I just really hated myself because I knew I was too afraid to every take my own life, that I was going to have to keep living because i was scared.|d1y9tlh|5007
Then how unfair everything was, that I was feeling this while the people that caused it where living happily.|d1y9tlh|5008
[BK][BK]So I pretty much decided to live to spite the people that caused me so much pain.|d1y9tlh|5009
Had a lot of anger at the time and I manage to use it to keep me going.|d1y9tlh|5010
When I got home my mum got a bit of a shock, I was pretty good at playing pretend until that night.|d1y9tlh|5011
My mum realized what a bad state I was in and took me to get help.|d1y9tlh|5012
"Probably not the best way to go about it but it worked and I have gotten a lot better since."""|d1y9tlh|5013
That time when I was 8 years old trying to slit my throat because I had enough of everyone bullying me and parents arguing and fighting everyday.|d1yameb|5014
Since that day I learnt to not give a fuck about anything since I know nobody does so about me.|d1yameb|5015
:/ Eh life goes on, still no idea whether I regret that I did not kill my self.|d1yameb|5016
'OH MY GOD!|d1y779y|5017
Weenie and piglet almost got hit by the truck!|d1y779y|5018
I need to save them!|d1y779y|5019
"'""[BK][BK]Seriously, I have not watch much about weenie the pooh or read much, but that is the first and only hallucination I had after overdosing my dad''s high blood pressure pills at 16."|d1y779y|5020
[BK][BK]Comparing to others, I feel like I attempted for the most ridiculous reason, which was I am so insecure about my parents'' feelings to me, or I was so NEEDY.|d1y779y|5021
They were decent parents, just busy with work constantly.|d1y779y|5022
(both programmers...) I have only been to a park and a zoo with them during my childhood, and every summer in elementary school, I got sent to my babu''s place, and they rarely called since they were busy with work.|d1y779y|5023
[BK][BK] They provide me with everything except for emotional communications.|d1y779y|5024
They are not incapable of showing affection, because during family get-togethers, they always play and care for my cousins, and would even gift them novelties that I never had.|d1y779y|5025
(Well... mostly just small stuff like Japanese candies/chocolates they bought as souvenirs when they were on business trips, and I was spoiled so much that I took my parents'' money, that had been spent on xboxes, play stations, psps, overseas vacations or other things I wanted, for granted, but still...|d1y779y|5026
I failed to realise that and got so jealous about their affection towards my cousins.)|d1y779y|5027
And I was constantly trying to get their praise and approval, so stressed out that I would had depression from junior high to half way through high school.|d1y779y|5028
[BK][BK]Struggling to get out of bed to save piglet (frankly weenie died in my hallucination), I vomited uncontrollably on the ground, and my mom heard and rushed to my room, and called off work to took care of me the whole night and the following three months since the overdoes had some side effects on me...had a fever for about a week, and then pneumonia, which I guess it is caused by the fever, and then my left ear started to act up.. cannot hear things at times, so went to see the doctor and ended up having a paracentesis tympani.|d1y779y|5029
[BK][BK]But I was glad besides the hospital visits for physical health problems, my parents did not miss to recognize my mental illness, and acted in time to book a really good psychiatrist for our family, and we did counseling for about a year, talking through a lot of things, solving the problems in our family.|d1y779y|5030
"[BK]"""|d1y779y|5031
"*'I am so cold'""*[BK][BK]I had either passed out or fallen asleep in the bathtub after bleeding and bleeding, and when I woke up I was freezing cold, dizzy/woozy as all heck, with my cut arm floating above the water and a scab starting to form."|d1ya211|5032
I did not have enough energy to try to cut again, but I was so cold all I could think was that I did not want to be cold anymore.|d1ya211|5033
Took me almost an hour to get out of the tub, clean myself up, and crawl into the hotel bed.|d1ya211|5034
I felt light-headed for almost two weeks.|d1ya211|5035
[BK][BK]I am doing a bit better since then, probably thanks to finally going on Zoloft, but when I look back at the whole mess, all I can remember is that before passing out I was not afraid.|d1ya211|5036
I felt so ready to die, at peace about it.|d1ya211|5037
Until I woke up, I had effectively killed myself and been okay with it.|d1ya211|5038
"Then I was just cold."""|d1ya211|5039
"My first thought was 'well as I am still alive I would better ring in work to tell them I am too sick to come in'"""""|d1ya0ni|5040
I thought of my little sister walking in my room to see me hanging by the window life-less.|d1yfqf2|5041
So sad....|d1yfqf2|5042
I felt bad for even trying.|d1yfqf2|5043
It was really weird because while in the process of trying, I had pseudo convinced myself I was not trying.|d1ya12i|5044
Like, I was telling my brain I was just taking all these pills to see what happened.|d1ya12i|5045
When I actually woke up from getting a bit fucked up, I was just really scared.|d1ya12i|5046
Like, fuck, had I actually just tried to die?|d1ya12i|5047
I never thought that I was doing that badly.|d1ya12i|5048
'Please do not take me to the hospital.|d1ya7hr|5049
I will have a mental health record.|d1ya7hr|5050
"I will never be able to get a job.'"""""|d1ya7hr|5051
'No one knows this even happened.|d1ya29t|5052
"Nor likely will.'"""""|d1ya29t|5053
I started laughing.|d1y79h6|5054
The rope I had tried to use was way too weak.|d1y79h6|5055
My dad had always said I was no good at tying knots.|d1y79h6|5056
I guess he was right.|d1y79h6|5057
I sat down and looked at my shoes for about 15 minutes.|d1y79h6|5058
[BK][BK]It was so surreal, building the last God only knows how many months of depression into one conscionable action that would decide my fate, and to fail that action created quite a cognitive dissonance in my life.|d1y79h6|5059
It was not the end of my depression and it was not the end of my suicidal thoughts but it was a significant roadblock to them taking over my life[BK][BK]I had rope burn around my neck for a few days and I had hit my shoulder when I had fallen so immediately after I had put the rope and stool away, cleaned up what little there was to, I sat down at my table and just kinda stated into space, not really thinking of anything but thinking of everything simultaneously.|d1y79h6|5060
[BK][BK]It was weird and I will never forget the exhilaration of actually being alive after that.|d1y79h6|5061
I have felt depression, and thought suicidal thoughts since but that memory, the rope burn, the stool and the weird way the sun had shone on the wall in my kitchen after I had tried came back to me and each time I tried a different way to fight it.|d1y79h6|5062
[BK]If I have learned one thing since its that you can fight it, but it is hard.|d1y79h6|5063
I nearly lost but you can fight it.|d1y79h6|5064
You just have to try.|d1y79h6|5065
Well, I do not know if what I did counts, but I did a 4 day binge on amphetamines.|d1y7avb|5066
I took 16 30mg vyvanse, snorted 3 adderall 30mg, and took 2 adderall xr 30mg.|d1y7avb|5067
My chest started hurting about day 2 and I did not give a shit.|d1y7avb|5068
So I definitely understood what was the probable end of this.|d1y7avb|5069
On day 4 about 30 minutes after pill 16 I stood up and my heart hurt extremely bad, my head felt this weird pressure, especially under my teeth, and everything went blank.|d1y7avb|5070
When I sat back down I looked at my friend and it took me about 10 seconds to realize who he was, where I was, and what I was doing.|d1y7avb|5071
I spent the next few hours feeling my blood desperately try to reach my head and feeling like i was passing out every now and again.|d1y7avb|5072
I balled my eyes out and I never cry.|d1y7avb|5073
Everything I valued that I did not realize I did, like the love of my parents, quickly became obvious.|d1y7avb|5074
I wrote them a death letter telling them how much I should have appreciated them because I was sure my heart was stopping soon, Or that the blood wouldnt stay in my head long enough.|d1y7avb|5075
After this same feeling continued for two days I just texted my dad, which seemed like the worst case scenario at the time, I just wished that I was dead so that I did not have to face my parents for some reason, 'can you come pick me up, I need you.|d1y7avb|5076
"'""[BK][BK]When they got there I got in the car, balled my eyes out and tried to get it out that I thought my heart was failing."|d1y7avb|5077
I cannot describe what this did to me mentally.|d1y7avb|5078
To not be alone in what I thought was my death, it was like years of having severe anxiety and depression melted away.|d1y7avb|5079
Maybe like an ego death or something.|d1y7avb|5080
Tons of abstract insecurities just washed clean.|d1y7avb|5081
It was wonderful.|d1y7avb|5082
Then about a week in bed passed, no doctor could explain why I feel the way I do even after ecgs and ultra sounds, and the old feeling crept back in when I started feeling like I should be doing something buy I could not.|d1y7avb|5083
[BK][BK]I wish I had a happy ending but I am just about the same as before i did this and it is been 6 months.|d1y7avb|5084
I still value that experience though.|d1y7avb|5085
"I know that there is something now that is seperating me from that state of normalcy. """|d1y7avb|5086
'Fuck.|d1ya2de|5087
What do I do now then?|d1ya2de|5088
"'""[BK][BK]I would thrown up the pills."|d1ya2de|5089
Never went to hospital and no doctors ever believed me when I told them later, threw up enough of them to avoid much in the way of damage apparently.|d1ya2de|5090
Missed the day of uni.|d1ya2de|5091
"Never got help."""|d1ya2de|5092

Let me start off with saying this.|d1y7dvp|5097
I am in a much better spot, with a loving fiancée, decent job while going to med school for my dream career.|d1y7dvp|5098
Life could not be better.|d1y7dvp|5099
Having said that, quite a few years back I cut my throat.|d1y7dvp|5100
I woke up in the hospital with crying parents, wishing I was not there.|d1y7dvp|5101
I was in pain, angry I was still alive, and now having to deal with my parents.|d1y7dvp|5102
What's worse was the therapy that followed in the next few weeks.|d1y7dvp|5103
It did not do a damned thing.|d1y7dvp|5104
However, much later there was a little moment of clarity.|d1y7dvp|5105
Nothing I was actually angry at, or upset about, was permanent.|d1y7dvp|5106
I could literally just leave, or change.|d1y7dvp|5107
And I did.|d1y7dvp|5108
It was hard, having to cut people out of my life.|d1y7dvp|5109
Some I considered friends, and some were family.|d1y7dvp|5110
But it was worth it.|d1y7dvp|5111
I changed my look, I changed as much as I possibly could.|d1y7dvp|5112
A year later I met the woman I am soon to marry, and im glad I failed.|d1y7dvp|5113
My first thought after my failed attempt was FUCK I'M ABOUT TO BE COMMITTED!|d1yi5a2|5114
I was forcibly committed for 3 months.|d1yi5a2|5115
NOT what I had planned on.|d1yi5a2|5116
Still haunts me to this day.|d1yi5a2|5117
Well in my particular situation, I was going through what was the roughest patch of my life (so far), I had had enough of it and was going to hang myself in my bedroom.|d1yaxc1|5118
I had the rope all tied off, a chair set up, everything.|d1yaxc1|5119
I got into the chair, put the rope around my throat, pulled it tight.. Then my younger brother walked in.|d1yaxc1|5120
[BK]He started crying his eyes out, pleading for me to get down, yelling at me in confusion, asking why, what was the matter, etc, etc.|d1yaxc1|5121
[BK][BK]It was then I realized, what would the damage be to my siblings, my parents, other family, friends.|d1yaxc1|5122
It would kill them (figuratively), if not send my brother or sister down the same path, and I could not let that happen.|d1yaxc1|5123
[BK]I then changed my life, my thoughts towards things, my actions, everything.|d1yaxc1|5124
I moved away from home and found my 'happy place', and now I could not be happier, then a pig in shit.|d1yaxc1|5125
I vaguely remember going from being in resuscitation with cables all over me, to being wheeled to an emergency ward and slipping in and out of consciousness after that.|d1yk300|5126
[BK][BK]I hated myself for being alive.|d1yk300|5127
I hated myself for hurting my mom and my boyfriend.|d1yk300|5128
I hated my boyfriend for making me feel so disgusting.|d1yk300|5129
I hated myself for being so disgusting.|d1yk300|5130
I wanted to cry but I was so out of it, i just could not - I also had such a dry mouth from the tablets I took, I really wanted a drink but just could not fathom how to ask or how to obtain a drink myself.|d1yk300|5131
regain consciousness[BK][BK]'Am I still alive?|d1yasoq|5132

In my case, I was sitting down to a French essay, and my head would not shut up.|d1ybejj|5137
I took 21 painkillers of various kinds and sat there waiting for the pain to go, and then I heard my family''s voices from downstairs.|d1ybejj|5138

First thoughts, fuck - now I am in more pain and nothing has been resolved.|d1ycus0|5140
[BK][BK]Over the next few days, was difficult.|d1ycus0|5141
Some people lashed out at me, some apologized, some distanced their selves from me.|d1ycus0|5142
[BK][BK]Over the next few years, never been so happy I failed something.|d1ycus0|5143
[BK][BK]I am a completely different person now, there is a reason why so many people urge others not to do it.|d1ycus0|5144
[BK][BK]I think the vast majority of people will be surprised by how many people have attempted, and how those people often do not fit stereotypes.|d1ycus0|5145
[BK][BK]Please if you are reading this and contemplating any actions - send me a PM - I am always here to talk.|d1ycus0|5146
I will give a little into my recent history.|d1y7icw|5147
My girlfriend and I that have been dating for 4 years, got into a big fight last year.|d1y7icw|5148
She started giving me less and less respect and more and more attitude until I flipped.|d1y7icw|5149
I told her that she was treating me like shit and told her that we were done.|d1y7icw|5150
[BK][BK]Yup, Facebook status to single (sounds cheesy but that is how news is official these days).|d1y7icw|5151
A few days later I get a call from her.|d1y7icw|5152
I was going to block her number permanently but for whatever reason I answered.|d1y7icw|5153
She was in the hospital from attempting suicide with sleeping pils, pain pills, alchol, anything from her family's medicine cabinet.|d1y7icw|5154
She wanted me to come see her.|d1y7icw|5155
[BK][BK]I never planned on seeing her again but my hearts true feelings came out and I got to her as soon as I could.|d1y7icw|5156
I stayed with her the whole time and never left her side.|d1y7icw|5157
Move forward about a few months and we are back together and everything is good.|d1y7icw|5158
[BK][BK]She talks about why she tried to commit suicide.|d1y7icw|5159
She said I was the most secure and stable thing in her life and without me she did not want to be here (alive) anymore.|d1y7icw|5160
I find a letter in the mail from her doctor saying that she has a miscarriage due to the suicide attempt.|d1y7icw|5161
[BK][BK]To this day I have the date written on a picture of her in my wallet.|d1y7icw|5162
The date is written small across my GF stomach.|d1y7icw|5163
I look at it and just think where my life would be right now with a wife and kids.|d1y7icw|5164
[BK][BK]I plan on marrying her and to have a child together.|d1y7icw|5165
I dream of the day I finally get to meet our baby.|d1y7icw|5166
I have struggled with suicide countless times.|d1y7jao|5167
I truly have lost counts of my thoughts, plans and attempts.|d1y7jao|5168
I have battled mental health issues and mental illness that has always led me to suicidal conclusions.|d1y7jao|5169
[BK][BK]I feel like I cannot escape the feelings, like they are a shadow watching my every move and that one day they will win, that my fate is inescapable.|d1y7jao|5170
[BK][BK]You know what helps me?|d1y7jao|5171
There is a young man who paces up and down my street, every day, several times a day, in rain or snow or sun or day or night.|d1y7jao|5172
He is always pacing slowly, smoking a cigarette or drinking a soda or just contemplating.|d1y7jao|5173
Whether I have a good day or a bad day, he will pace.|d1y7jao|5174
He is the one constant thing in my otherwise turbulent, unpredictable life.|d1y7jao|5175
He keeps me grounded on shitty and wonderful days.|d1y7jao|5176
He will never know how much I appreciate and care for him.|d1y7jao|5177
He saves my life every single day that he walks.|d1y7jao|5178

I felt useless and thought(somewhat still think) all of those insults they used to say about me were true.|d1y7lyv|5183
[BK][BK]I felt worthless and tried to OD.|d1y7lyv|5184
[BK]I took one pill after another but slowly enough.|d1y7lyv|5185
"When I reached the 'dangerous'"" level I just broke out."|d1y7lyv|5186
[BK]I am someone that does not cry anymore, since all of this shit happened to me, 6 years ago, I am totally unable to cry.|d1y7lyv|5187
My therapists never accepted the fight I might be depressed until recently.|d1y7lyv|5188
All that time I felt like I was just a terrible mistake, and, since you hear about depressed people breaking down, and my therapist not telling me anything; I felt like I was just faking it all and I was not even sure of all my feelings.|d1y7lyv|5189
[BK][BK]So I broke down, sobbing one or two tears, the best I could do.|d1y7lyv|5190
I was, and still am, too scared of finishing it off.|d1y7lyv|5191
I was,what, a few pills away from it but I just could not.|d1y7lyv|5192
"[BK][BK]I do not know if its really '""surviving suicide'"" but I felt a need to share it here."|d1y7lyv|5193
"What I said happened 3 times in the past years but I never managed to go further."""|d1y7lyv|5194
I have got two attempts and one almost attempt to my name.|d1y7p5x|5195
First attempt was trying to swallow pills and just pray I never wake up, I cannot remember what pills they were but I was 17 and stupid so probably nothing that could kill me.|d1y7p5x|5196
Woke up with vomit in my bed and nobody to notice it at home.|d1y7p5x|5197
First thought was 'where the fuck am I?'|d1y7p5x|5198
Since well I thought i was never waking up.|d1y7p5x|5199
[BK][BK][BK]Sending attempt was 2 weeks later.|d1y7p5x|5200
Tried hanging myself in the backyard.|d1y7p5x|5201
Turns out not being a boyscout paid off, the knot at the loop came undone and all I could think was 'I cannot even fucking kill myself properly' [BK][BK]Almost attempt came 3 months later while in counseling and under near 24 hour surveillance from my family or any authority figures cause my parents had seen the cuts on my arms.|d1y7p5x|5202
[BK][BK] Something minor had set me off, probably something girl related (my girlfriend at the time was also severely depressed, loved her to death, and we helped each other at times but overall we were just straight bad for one another) [BK][BK]So I decided that it was not worth everything, I decided to sneak out and hang myself in the middle of the night (I had a fixation with this way as the summer prior my best friend hung himself, and I was not smart enough for the right pills)  [BK][BK]The thing that changed my mind was remembering that friends mom at his funeral service.|d1y7p5x|5203
I could not bear to think of my mom in the same way, or my friends who were already still living with his death having to go on with mine too.|d1y7p5x|5204
[BK][BK]I think the only reason those thoughts even occurred is because I went to get help (even if it was non optional) so please please please if you are in a dark place get some help.|d1y7p5x|5205
When just taking to the therapist helps.|d1y7p5x|5206
They're not emotionally invested so you can actually have a chance for a rational conversation about what is going on.|d1y7p5x|5207
"'Dying does not hurt nearly as bad as coming back does.'"""""|d1ybnvg|5208
I did not understand what was happening.|d1ybnal|5209
"Once I realized that I was alive and that I had failed, my first real thought was simply: 'Dammit.'"""|d1ybnal|5210
[BK][BK]That was one of three attempts, all of them being very similar.|d1ybnal|5211
"It''s not an easy thing to go through but like to think I am better for having been through it and experiencing those feelings."""|d1ybnal|5212
Probably buried but first time i tried to kill myself was drinking a liter of vodka and downing a bottle full of xanax.|d1y7sff|5213
Went to the hospital after being more depressed than normal and not being able to sleep for 2 weeks, started getting facial ticks and hallucinations, etc.|d1y7sff|5214
[BK][BK]Anyway the first time my roommates at the time had no idea what was going on.|d1y7sff|5215
They told me that apparently I cried like crazy and was muttering to myself and banging my head.|d1y7sff|5216
I went to sleep somehow face down  and woke up with vomit all over everything.|d1y7sff|5217
"First thing i remember was 'fuck why am i still here'"" few seconds later '""wtf did i just do'""...[BK][BK]Second time I was home after graduating still no job or anything, just wasting space."|d1y7sff|5218
As a side note I am diagnosed with major depression and general anxiety disorder.|d1y7sff|5219
My ex who cheated on me like 30+ times in our 1.5 year relationship called me after we broke up for like 1 day so far, just to let me know she fucked someone else.|d1y7sff|5220
I was not stable emotionally and so I went to the liquor store, drank another liter of vodka and downed another bottle full of xanax.|d1y7sff|5221
[BK][BK]I really wanted to die.|d1y7sff|5222
I passed out on the street, neighbors drove me to the hospital.|d1y7sff|5223
"Woke up and thought '""fuck im a piece of shit i cannot even die correctly, why are not i dead, fuck you god, seriously fuck you, my whole life I have prayed that i would just die and you cannot give me that, fuck god, fuck god'""."|d1y7sff|5224
Saw my parents there waiting, felt horrible about it.|d1y7sff|5225
Sister told me my dad cried (he never cries, he is a tough ass motherfucker).|d1y7sff|5226
They left after I said i needed some time, I started to cry about how alone I am, and I have no friends.|d1y7sff|5227
"[BK][BK]Realized that when I tried to talk to my so called '""friends'"" for help, no one gave a shit about me."|d1y7sff|5228
I actually only have 1 real friend who tried to visit me and see if I was okay, he is forever my blood brother even if he lives far.|d1y7sff|5229
And I am closer to my family.|d1y7sff|5230
[BK][BK]Anyway ended up in mental hospital, out patient treatment, multiple psychologists and therapists and the whole shebang.|d1y7sff|5231
[BK][BK]Still feel like killing myself but will not do it until my parents pass away.|d1y7sff|5232
I am a 28 year old loser who is pretty much a shut in and doing shit jobs just to pass time.|d1y7sff|5233
[BK]For those wondering I have a bachelor''s in biology, I wanted to be a doctor, did worse and worse each semester as things got worse, still graduated.|d1y7sff|5234

[BK][BK]3rd attempt.|d1y7sob|5245
I just remember feeling passed that I could not do it and I had to run.|d1y7sob|5246
So I drove 300 miles and got rid of my phone and bought a new one.|d1y7sob|5247
I realized I was wrong about 16 hours later, then I was glad for my wife to be holding me.|d1y7sob|5248
Then we changed the highway we were on.|d1y7sob|5249
And I knew I was being taken to the hospital I had been only once before and I could not imagine going back I was hurt.|d1y7sob|5250
I planned on running out the door.|d1y7sob|5251
I did not do any of that, I was in the ER for over 12 hours before admitted.|d1y7sob|5252
My wife was only there for the first and last hour.|d1y7sob|5253
I struggled with bitterness and telling truth and wanting to return the favor of bringing me to the hospital.|d1y7sob|5254

"'""[BK][BK]For me it was a large amount of pills."|d1y7uvf|5281
Over the period of roughly three months I had been prescribed four different medications for back pain, and after enough mornings in pain and misery and watching as the marriage I had just gotten into crumble around me, I decided to end it.|d1y7uvf|5282
Two of the prescriptions I was allergic to, and all told I had somewhere near eighty pills to swallow, so I set out to end it in a numb mess.|d1y7uvf|5283
[BK][BK]I went down to a vending machine, slapped in enough money to get about eight Monsters, and just sat around the corner of the building trading back and forth between chugging Monster and throwing back pills.|d1y7uvf|5284
Once both were polished off, I walked over to a trash can, disposed of the empty bottles and cans, and went to light up a cigarette.|d1y7uvf|5285
All told it was maybe two minutes that it took me to slam the medication down, so I figured one last smoke was reasonable.|d1y7uvf|5286
A friend saw me, asked if I was alright, and I just looked at him and smiled.|d1y7uvf|5287
"'""I am fantastic, I just committed suicide.'"""|d1y7uvf|5288
I finished the cigarette, snuffed it out, stood up, and blacked out on my way to the floor.|d1y7uvf|5289
[BK][BK]Since then things have gotten better.|d1y7uvf|5290
It took a lot more trauma, a touch of booze, and a lot of nights spent crying over my past opportunities , but in time I came to realize that it was possible to be fine again.|d1y7uvf|5291

I really wanted to die.|d1y7vhl|5296
I never lost consciousness, but arriving at the hospital was kind of a blur.|d1y7vhl|5297
There were some traumatic aspects to how I was treated, both physically and mentally.|d1y7vhl|5298
(I made a complaint some years later, there was an investigation and I received a full apology.|d1y7vhl|5299
Suffice to say they treated me like crap.)|d1y7vhl|5300
[BK][BK]I thought my mum would come to the hospital, hold my hand, be there for me somehow, but she did not.|d1y7vhl|5301
Realising I was all alone and nobody gave a flying fuck about me was the worst moment of my life.|d1y7vhl|5302
(And no, I am not wrong.|d1y7vhl|5303
She did not give a fuck.|d1y7vhl|5304
This is the woman who a) ignored the fact I was being abused by my father and b) used to ignore me or look through me if I was upset.|d1y7vhl|5305
)[BK][BK]I just wanted someone, anyone, to hold my hand and say: I am so sorry you feel so sad.|d1y7vhl|5306
And nobody did.|d1y7vhl|5307
I was just alone, with nurses talking to me like I was nothing because, they said, they had other patients who did not choose to put themselves in the hospital.|d1y7vhl|5308

I apologize if anyone feels like it was not a proper attempt so it should not be posted.|d1y84g8|5372
[BK][BK]I was driving home from class one day during the majority portion of my life in which I was clinically depressed due to a number of factors (though primarily trauma and unfortunate life circumstances).|d1y84g8|5373
It was night and the road was empty and I was feeling a little bit of a spiral come on.|d1y84g8|5374
I started to cry and eventually just shut my eyes and pressed my foot down completely on the pedal.|d1y84g8|5375
My little car started picking up speed and struggling but I heard it rev harder than I had ever before.|d1y84g8|5376
My hands were shaking and I was desperately trying to build up the strength to jerk the wheel.|d1y84g8|5377
[BK][BK]I came to my senses after what felt like an eternity but I imagine was not more than a minute because I had not drifted off the road yet, only into the opposite lane from where I started (it was a wide highway).|d1y84g8|5378
I do not remember how fast I was going at the peak of it because I slammed my brake and started slowing down in a panic before I looked at the speedometer.|d1y84g8|5379
But I had time to put my brake on and open my eyes to look and in that time it still had not dropped below the high 80s in a car with quite good brakes.|d1y84g8|5380
[BK][BK]My first thought was how terrible of a person I am and how I really SHOULD just do it if that is how reckless and inconsiderate of others I am, to endanger them like that.|d1y84g8|5381
My second thought was that I need to tell someone.|d1y84g8|5382
Unfortunately, I was in the middle of nowhere and was too nervous as an 18 year old girl to pull over in the middle of the night and stop for a long time.|d1y84g8|5383
So I kept driving even though I was shaking so hard I could not keep the car straight and had to focus really hard to not swerve side to side.|d1y84g8|5384

"Okay.'"""|d1y835o|5433
Nothing much.|d1y835o|5434
At that point, I was so devoid of feeling I did not really care.|d1y835o|5435
It was just another day.|d1y835o|5436
"[BK][BK]I took 825 mg of Doxylamine with a bottle of vodka (wikipedia says '""the lethal dose is 50–500 mg/kg'""), and dozed off in the living room chair."|d1y835o|5437
My brother had skipped school and come home early, and was pissed I was in said chair, so he woke me up.|d1y835o|5438
If he had not, maybe I would be dead, who knows.|d1y835o|5439
But he did, so I ended up calling my parents, who freaked out.|d1y835o|5440
And then I hallucinated in sepia tone for a while at the hospital.|d1y835o|5441
"Fun times."""|d1y835o|5442
I tried when I was 10, then again at 11.|d1ybt82|5443
"When I woke up I was confused and my first thought was: 'my poor mom, I hope she knows this was not her fault'""[BK][BK]I then spent years trying to convince her that I am sane enough to want to live, and that it is not her fault."|d1ybt82|5444
"[BK][BK]I asked my friend when I got out: '""there is no God, there is no heaven or hell..why then, do you continue?"|d1ybt82|5445
Knowing we are all walking dirt, how do you not just kill yourself?|d1ybt82|5446
"'""[BK][BK]He said he has faith, not in God, but in humans."|d1ybt82|5447
We keep surviving things, and he wants to be around to help others if we are faced with a catastrophic emergency.|d1ybt82|5448
Since then I have adopted his faith, and even found God.|d1ybt82|5449
[BK][BK]I understand this is reddit and is strongly atheist, and I get why...but I have a reason to not kill myself now, and that is a very fragile thing.|d1ybt82|5450
I will joke along with people, I am not an uppity spiritual person, but fundamentally without faith in humanity and my relationship with God I feel like going back to those dark places..|d1ybt82|5451
I have not been to a church service but a few times a year I sit on the steps of a church nearby and have a couple drinks and just talk shit out.|d1ybt82|5452
"It''s very theraputic."""|d1ybt82|5453
When I was 15, I tried to strangle myself with my football belt.|d1ybwvm|5454
"It was the type of belt with the two metal 'D'"" shapes at the end that you loop through and pull tight."|d1ybwvm|5455
I had placed it around my neck and pulled as tight as I could.|d1ybwvm|5456
I started feeling like my face was turning to stone (it is the best way I can describe the sensation).|d1ybwvm|5457
[BK][BK]The next thing I know I hear my stepmother calling me from the top of the stairs.|d1ybwvm|5458
My room was in the basement, so my parents would just open the door and yell down when dinner was ready.|d1ybwvm|5459
I was completely embarrassed.|d1ybwvm|5460
I now had a huge mark around my neck.|d1ybwvm|5461
The belt must have loosened just enough for me to regain blood flow and start breathing again.|d1ybwvm|5462
I threw on a turtleneck and went upstairs.|d1ybwvm|5463
"Never to speak of it again."""|d1ybwvm|5464
I had just been told by someone close to me that I was a failure at everything in life, so while I was throwing up antifreeze the only thing I could think of was how disappointed I was in myself.|d1yezqs|5465
[BK]I could not even succeed in noping out of life.|d1yezqs|5466
[BK]There was not any relief, there was no anger, there was just deep, profound disappointment that I would never get out of this.|d1yezqs|5467
I just had a realization that nothing was going to be the same.|d1y83jw|5468
[BK][BK]My wife was the one that discovered me.|d1y83jw|5469
She called my mom.|d1y83jw|5470
I was given a choice between going to a psych hospital voluntarily or by police escort, police escort is an automatic visit to Green Oaks in Dallas...fuck that place.|d1y83jw|5471
I chose to go voluntarily.|d1y83jw|5472
Went to a private hospital.|d1y83jw|5473
It was still the worst week and few days of my entire life.|d1y83jw|5474
[BK][BK]I was given a diagnosis of BP 1[BK][BK]I did not sleep the entire time...even on Ambien.|d1y83jw|5475
I had an awful reaction the first night to meds they gave me; not sure if it was the Trazadone or the Abilify.|d1y83jw|5476
[BK][BK]I was switched to Ambien and Depakote after that.|d1y83jw|5477
[BK][BK]They took away my anxiety meds.|d1y83jw|5478
My normally excellent blood pressure of 110/65 shot up to a regular reading of 140/90 for the duration of my stay.|d1y83jw|5479
They put me on this shitty stuff called Vistaril; it is essentially a giant dose of Benadryl.|d1y83jw|5480
Did nothing for my anxiety.|d1y83jw|5481
[BK][BK]I guess I should mention that they took my anxiety meds because I would swallowed a bunch of them and slashed my arms--so I guess that is on me.|d1y83jw|5482
[BK][BK]Ummm, my roommates (I went through two) snored insanely loud.|d1y83jw|5483
Part of the reason I did not sleep, though given my anxiety level I doubt I would have slept even in a solo room.|d1y83jw|5484
Plus I am used to a box fan and you are not getting a box fan in a psych ward.|d1y83jw|5485
[BK][BK]They also had someone coming through to check on me every few hours...I do not know why....but it was inconvenient to say the least.|d1y83jw|5486
[BK][BK]I spent the week trolling the nurses station, trying to talk my way out of that place.|d1y83jw|5487
Told my psych that I was okay.|d1y83jw|5488
That I did not need to be there.|d1y83jw|5489
I did not go to most of my classes or meetings or whatever you want to call them.|d1y83jw|5490
In short I was a pain in the ass.|d1y83jw|5491
They called my family and told them I was being extremely uncooperative and manipulative.|d1y83jw|5492
Took a long time after being discharged before I even became med compliant.|d1y83jw|5493
I am surprised my wife put up with me.|d1y83jw|5494
[BK][BK]Saw a lot of crazy (no pun intended) shit while I was in there.|d1y83jw|5495
[BK][BK]Anyway, that is an abbreviated version of my suicide attempt and the repercussions.|d1y83jw|5496
It's been a long road (6 years) since my diagnosis.|d1y83jw|5497
I have been in and out of day programs and almost committed multiple times.|d1y83jw|5498
I have been med resistant and fallen in and out of self harm patterns.|d1y83jw|5499
I am going through a major bout of rapid cycling as I type this and am due for a meeting with my psych and a med adjustment in a few days.|d1y83jw|5500
[BK][BK]This mental illness shit is a tough road to plough.|d1y83jw|5501
Every day is a fight.|d1y83jw|5502
But I will not give up.|d1y83jw|5503
[BK][BK]Sorry for the ramble.|d1y83jw|5504
I conciously chose to think nothing.|d1y86ko|5505
I woke up on my floor surrounded by empty sleeping pill packs, bloody paper towels, and a empty bag of green onion SunChips, mostly spilled, my chosen last meal.|d1y86ko|5506
Suprisingly, I did not throw up or anything.|d1y86ko|5507
My friend was banging on my bedroom door.|d1y86ko|5508
He had no idea, he thought I was just being lazy, and he wanted to go swimming at a local waterfall.|d1y86ko|5509
I cleared my mind to help hide from the reality of what I would done.|d1y86ko|5510
I felt like I was watching a black and white movie of the day, like I was actually dead and I was seeing what I missed out on.|d1y86ko|5511
I was really disappointed when I eventually figured out I was still alive.|d1y86ko|5512
This is the 3rd time I have even brought it up.|d1y86ko|5513
I regret not dying.|d1y86ko|5514
I still think about trying again sometimes.|d1y86ko|5515
I will try a different brand of pills.|d1y86ko|5516
Or maybe I will just shoot myself and save the guesswork.|d1y86ko|5517
"'I am so fucking useless I cannot kill myself'""."|d1yc1kl|5518
"[BK][BK]Yes, after years I realise this is terrible."""|d1yc1kl|5519
I woke up looking at the finger painting I had made while writing my suicide note, and all I could think about was how hard it was to see and how badly I needed to throw up.|d1y87l2|5520
I stumbled out of my room to the toilet and hurled all of the pills that I had taken a few hours earlier.|d1y87l2|5521
My vision was so blurry and I was so bent out of shape, it is a wonder I could move at all, much less down the hall to the bathroom.|d1y87l2|5522
I felt a hell of a lot better after puking, so I crawled back to my room and passed out.|d1y87l2|5523
[BK][BK]The next thing I knew, I could hear that god-damned mockingbird who lived in the tree outside my window.|d1y87l2|5524
Daylight was shining through the French blinds onto my face as I lay in bed.|d1y87l2|5525
I had an insane migraine headache and my ears were ringing like I had been to the most epic metal concert of my life.|d1y87l2|5526
I remember feeling so defeated, like the cliché guy who fucks up anything and everything, even his own suicide.|d1y87l2|5527
At the same time, I felt a bit glad about my lack of success, so I got up and attempted to carry on with my life like normal.|d1y87l2|5528
Surprise, though, I ended up spending the next week and a half hallucinating, hearing voices, and talking to people in my kitchen who were not even there.|d1y87l2|5529
I even thought there was some kind of rodent living inside my couch.|d1y87l2|5530
I could see him and feel him running around underneath the leather, when in fact, there was absolutely nothing there.|d1y87l2|5531
The after-effect of the overdose was really fucking weird and creepy.|d1y87l2|5532
Never tried suicide again after that.|d1y87l2|5533
'You could not even do that right.|d1yxrel|5534

I took a paracetamol overdose when I was 17 and drank a little vodka with it (I did not have a lot).|d1ycb91|5537
[BK][BK]I actually went and did a short shift at a supermarket but ended up leaving early and going to bed.|d1ycb91|5538
I woke up as normal thinking nothing had happened and was getting ready for work and my Mum somehow got it out of me that something was up.|d1ycb91|5539
I confessed to what I would done and said I felt fine so I was expecting to just carry on the day as normal.|d1ycb91|5540
[BK][BK]IF YOU TAKE AN OVERDOSE AND WAKE UP FEELING 'FINE' - YOU'RE NOT.|d1ycb91|5541
GO TO THE HOSPITAL.|d1ycb91|5542
[BK][BK]Paracetamol in particular will take a long time to kill you and it is a painful death as your organs shut down.|d1ycb91|5543
[BK][BK]It was to late for me to have my stomach pumped so I spent 2 days in hospital on a drop.|d1ycb91|5544
I was 17 and had to be on a childrens ward, it was horrible.|d1ycb91|5545
I have tried a few times.|d1yc8li|5546
Different each time but usually a general shame that I could not even do that right.|d1yc8li|5547
Shit.|d1yc8p4|5548
The cops are here.|d1yc8p4|5549
I walked out of the woods with a very bloody arm, and the headlights of four cars in front of me.|d1yc8p4|5550
Oh fuck, I am alive.|d1yc99g|5551
Wait.|d1yc99g|5552
That's a good thing.|d1yc99g|5553
I somehow immediately got better than I was before the attempt.|d1yc99g|5554
2/10 would not overdose on alprazolame again|d1yc99g|5555
I am surprised there is not a lot of feelgood bullshit going on in here.|d1y8pdz|5556
"Shit like 'it is never worth it'"" or worthless platitudes like '""killing yourself is never the right option'""."|d1y8pdz|5557
[BK][BK]There''s a lot of good answers here, so I do not think I would be able to add anything of worth to OP''s question, but I guess I will say that those who have have not suffered through suicidal depression have no clue what it is like.|d1y8pdz|5558
No point of reference that could possibly compare.|d1y8pdz|5559
Like trying to comprehend what a billion of something truly means.|d1y8pdz|5560
I will tell you, I came out through the other side after years of agony, but no matter how good my life gets, no matter what happens to me, it will never be worth it.|d1y8pdz|5561
[BK][BK]It was torture.|d1y8pdz|5562
A torture I could not escape, and I thought would go on until I died.|d1y8pdz|5563
A torture where I did not even have the sanctity of my own mind to protect me.|d1y8pdz|5564
My brain was the torturer.|d1y8pdz|5565
In the end, most people have that, they at least have their mind as the one last place of refuge.|d1y8pdz|5566
I did not even have that.|d1y8pdz|5567
[BK][BK]No amount of good that comes into my life, no amount of joy will ever be worth what I went through.|d1y8pdz|5568
If I was pulled back in time, and I knew I had to go through it again, I would kill myself in a heartbeat.|d1y8pdz|5569
"As of right now, I am content, satisfied, with just not being in agony every waking moment. """|d1y8pdz|5570

This just happened one week ago actually.|d1yfjlb|5590
I knew I was not going to succeed when my brother walked down stairs to find me laying on the ground bleeding from the neck with a knife in my hand.|d1yfjlb|5591
I still kind of regret not succeeding.|d1yfjlb|5592
About two weeks ago I tried to end myself with rubbing alcohol, and needless to say it was not at all fun.|d1y89lu|5593
[BK][BK]Pretty much seconds after I started chugging it out of the bottle my throat swelled up and I couldnt breathe at all for a good few seconds, and at that moment I realized I seriously fucked up.|d1y89lu|5594
[BK][BK]All of this happened outside my house really late at night, and the alcohol part of it kicked in nigh instantly because it was only ten minutes later that I was wandering my small town without enough clothes on for the weather hoping I would freeze to death or pass out and not wake up, but it never ended up happening, and because of my regret I managed to get on the phone with a friend, and I ended up throwing the bottle of rubbing alcohol as far from myself as possible and going back home.|d1y89lu|5595
[BK][BK]I ended up not even waking my parents while sneaking back into the house, and even got a nights rest, but I was still suffering in the morning, and I would ended up getting a friend to cally parents because I could not face them myself in the state I was in, they got me to a hospital and I was watched over and then released the same day, because I would only managed to get down maybe 100ml of the 500ml bottle, and ended up metabolizing it.|d1y89lu|5596
[BK][BK]The following days were mostly spent nursing a hangover filled with regret and some self beating on for what I would done, but I came out of it realizing it was an impulse act fuelled by my mild depression and suicidal thoughts, as I would found the rubbing alcohol not even three hours before I attempted suicide with it.|d1y89lu|5597
[BK][BK]Currently I am still sort of nursing myself back to mental health and I am signed up for an intensive outpatient program, which is essentially a daily group therapy on week days, and so far I have already rebounded back to what I would call decently stable (still probably mildly depressed though)|d1y89lu|5598
When I tried to hang myself junior year of HS I thought that would be the solution to all my issues.|d1y8b5h|5599
That all the pain and shit I have felt and thought about would be gone.|d1y8b5h|5600
The memories of my parents fighting and me hiding, the times I was bullied, the times I just felt terrible about myself.|d1y8b5h|5601
I thought they would all be gone.|d1y8b5h|5602
Then when I tried to do it it is weird I just could not bring myself to do it, and thinking back on it 8 years later, I really cannot come up with a reason why.|d1y8b5h|5603
[BK][BK]I do not remember my first conscious thought.|d1y8b5h|5604
[BK][BK]I sorta blacked the memory out, but a feeling is still there.|d1y8b5h|5605
The feeling that I do not want any other person to feel that way about themselves.|d1y8b5h|5606
That life is that hopeless.|d1y8b5h|5607
So, while it was a battle and still is a battle this very day, I focused my life on a career of entertainment, specifically comedy, because I want to tell stories that make people laugh and also understand mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety.|d1y8b5h|5608
I guess what drove me not to do it ultimately is the idea that if I can make people laugh and smile for one moment it is worth going through all shitty parts of my life.|d1y8b5h|5609
I remember waking up, feeling awake, but I do not really remember seeing anything.|d1y8d87|5610
I am not sure I was conscious enough yet, all I remember is realizing how warm my chest felt before I put my cold fingers to my favorite T shirt to feel the blood.|d1y8d87|5611
It made my shirt feel like wet velvet.|d1y8d87|5612
I had just fallen 12 feet and the blood from my head had ran down most of my body, pooling around me in a ravine that I thought was deeper than it was before I jumped.|d1y8d87|5613
"My first thought was 'Fuck, what is this shit?'""."|d1y8d87|5614

I am a bigger guy, so I guess I did not take enough because I woke up I do not know how much longer later and I recognized it did not work, then when I tried to get up, I could not move my legs...|d1y8enr|5620

[BK]It was not easy, and although I have a beautiful family, a stable job, finances under control, and do not abuse drugs I still get a random bought of depression.|d1y8glf|5632

When I attempted suicide I had lost my grandfather, my step dad was abusive, my boyfriend molested me and raped me once, and I was dealing with teenage hormones on top of it all.|d1y8glf|5634

Followed rapidly by a resignation that cut me so deeply to the core, it was just total resolution that I would continue getting kicked in the teeth (by life) until I worked up the balls to try again.|d1y8kn8|5673
[BK][BK]I would run a hose from the exhaust of my car into the cab/ seating area, and idled the car until I fell asleep.|d1y8kn8|5674
I was parked in a lot near this beatiful park I would grown up next to at like 3 AM.|d1y8kn8|5675
My mom was concerned about me, sent a neighbor to look for me, and they just happened to see my vehicle while driving around the neighborhood.|d1y8kn8|5676
[BK][BK]The worst part is having everyone around you know, and be ultra sensitive and weird, like you have not already gone over the edge and anything they say will tip you that way.|d1y8kn8|5677

The depression makes me feel that way, like I am worth  nothing, and at times I will believe it.|d1y8muh|5689
I get urges all the time to jump out a car or keep on drinking until I meet my maker, but when I woke up I was scared that I had gone through with it.|d1y8muh|5690
I cried and cried and held a knife, just shaking and trying to work up the courage to slit my throat like a beautiful smile.|d1y8muh|5691
But I thought to myself there was no way in hell I will let myself lose to the thoughts, so I called a friend and got help.|d1y8muh|5692
[BK][BK]What people do not realize often about depression is that it works differently in different people.|d1y8muh|5693
It scares the shit out if me.|d1y8muh|5694
My depression does not make me sad, it makes me angry for no reason, and I mean anger like I caught someone fucking my own mother after drugging her after a turn with my sister's.|d1y8muh|5695
The urges make me want to slam people into the counter at work for asking me what size coffee we have, or kicking a puppy for licking me too much.|d1y8muh|5696
I fight my depression by making myself sad, listening to music I know will trigger me and thinking about the day I found out my son's mother cut her own throat the way I was about to my own (two years later I found out, it broke me).|d1y8muh|5697
Point of my ramble is that I am glad I got help, I am glad I have the strength to not stab my co-workers and to not hurt that puppy, I am glad I have people that care about me, even if the devil on my shoulder tries his hardest to convince me no one cares.|d1y8muh|5698

Had severe anxiety and fear throughout the whole thing and even had some moments after my mother calmed down (after 12-14).|d1zgdl7|5728
She started to calm down when she took a strike with the belt buckle and I just grabbed the buckle mid air and stared at her.|d1zgdl7|5729

Affected my grades, did not give 2 shits, I would get beath either way, but I did not because I did not realise that is when my mother calmed herself.|d1zgdl7|5735
Graduated high school with these guys with the last year the best year of my life.|d1zgdl7|5736
Met the love of my life because of them.|d1zgdl7|5737
She was their childhood friend, a batchmate of ours in school, different section because we were in this school that had sections segregating boys and girls.|d1zgdl7|5738
Somehow convinced her I was boyfriend material after high scool, around 2010 and still together to this day.|d1zgdl7|5739

Currently love my mother and my brother, despite all of that happened to me.|d1zgdl7|5747
I was mostly a coward in my suicide attempts, but almost happened and that scares me today.|d1zgdl7|5748
I still appreciate what my friends did for me despite them barely knowing a thing about my situation at the time.|d1zgdl7|5749
I still chat with them, have voice calls on the internet while we play separate games or occasionally play together.|d1zgdl7|5750
Somehow getting this off my chest was good.|d1zgdl7|5751

[BK][BK]After the first two times, I considered other methods.|d1y8s60|5867
The benefit of wrist slashing was that I found out, for me, self-harm is a protective mechanism - it shocks me out of the fugue state I get into when I am suicidal.|d1y8s60|5868
That helped me survive a good few years.|d1y8s60|5869
[BK][BK]I was genuinely trying to die, but my core reasoning - that it was to protect the people I loved who would be sad for a while but overall the balance would mean their lives would be infinitely better without me - meant that consideration of who would find me and how traumatic that would be was a primary concern.|d1y8s60|5870
[BK][BK]I am convinced that this accounts for a major part of the discrepancy between men and women''s suicidal behaviour - women try more, men complete more.|d1y8s60|5871
Women are socialised to be continually aware of the people around us and how our existence affects them.|d1y8s60|5872
The much more certainly lethal methods are also the most traumatic for others.|d1y8s60|5873

A few months after seeing this counselor my parents decided it would be best for us to move out of this town for my sake.|d1y8ti5|5932
I ended up completely turning my life around and went into high school pretty confident and became friends with a lot of people there.|d1y8ti5|5933
I was a class clown so that kind of helped as well.|d1y8ti5|5934
I always look back on this and am so glad I did not take my life that day because I am now married, have my own apartment, work for a decent company making decent pay and am trying to have a baby.|d1y8ti5|5935

A bit of back story.|d1yebtl|5949
I was borderline depressed.|d1yebtl|5950
I felt that I was a waste of space.|d1yebtl|5951
I did not bring anyone happiness.|d1yebtl|5952
I made my partner unhappy (or so I thought.|d1yebtl|5953
It was a toxic relationship), my parents, my siblings.|d1yebtl|5954
I did not want to exist.|d1yebtl|5955
I took pills.|d1yebtl|5956
They were not enough.|d1yebtl|5957
I remember still being upset, but there was the slight relief that I was OK. No one knew except my partner at the time.|d1yebtl|5958
Nothing compared to these other stories.|d1yebtl|5959
But I wanted to say that there is always something better.|d1yebtl|5960
As clichéd as it sounds, it WILL get better.|d1yebtl|5961

I did not actually pass out after I OD''d 2 years ago.|d1y97r6|5970
I got it into my head that overdosing on levothyroxine was viable, so I took all of the levothyroxine in my apartment (it was something like 10-20 mg).|d1y97r6|5971
A few hours later, I called poison control, realized I needed to get help, and called 911 from a bus stop.|d1y97r6|5972
[BK][BK]I probably realized I had not succeeded at the hospital, though my memories from that particular moment are somewhat vague (it was 3 or 4 in the morning at this point).|d1y97r6|5973
"I probably thought something along the lines of 'wow, I probably made my life a lot more difficult without actually risking my life very much.'"""|d1y97r6|5974
I may have been wrong there--though I stayed off of Levothyroxine for a while, I had to take a beta blocker for several weeks to deal with the side effects of the levothyroxine overdose.|d1y97r6|5975
Beta blockers are the worst.|d1y97r6|5976
[BK][BK]In retrospect, I cannot help thinking that I probably made my thyroid cancer worse with that overdose (I have had 2 surgeries since then).|d1y97r6|5977

August of last year me and my ex had just split i had been forced into an abortion at the time and it killed me i could not handle life anymore i had been on so many different anti depressants and was so broken i decided i do not care anymore went and brought packets of panadol nurofen and had my anti depressants.|d1yeiww|5994
Took quite alot i was through three packets one panado one nurofen and one antidepressants (zoloft).|d1yeiww|5995
In my dazed motion i accidently sent a snap chat to a friend saying goodbye.|d1yeiww|5996

I woke up in the hospital feeling something like a hangover.|d1y8ycd|6004
It was basically because my body was overtired since I had fought like an animal when they were forcing the coals down my throat.|d1y8ycd|6005
For those that do not know what that is it is standard procedure to put coals into the patients system if he is admitted to the ICU because of attemted suicide through pain medication, so he will vomit up anything inside his stomach.|d1y8ycd|6006
Apparently the coals also work like a sponge while they are inside you, sucking up whatever it is you ingested.|d1y8ycd|6007
But to get them inside you they have to force a tube down your neck and into your stomach.|d1y8ycd|6008
I do not remember much of what happened in while this was happening.|d1y8ycd|6009
But I had vague memories of me screaming my lungs out like I had experienced a nightmare.|d1y8ycd|6010
I also had rashes all over my body that formed because I over exerted myself while wrestling with the doctors.|d1y8ycd|6011
But the first thing that came to my mind when I regained full consciousness was shame.|d1y8ycd|6012
I was deeply ashamed of myself for having done something so stupid.|d1y8ycd|6013
The way my family looked at me was something I wont forget.|d1y8ycd|6014
I was 18 at the time and had never really dealt with my depression or told anyone about it so it came as a huge surprise to them.|d1y8ycd|6015
I felt alienated from them because of my actions.|d1y8ycd|6016
[BK][BK]I had to see a psychiatrist after the incident (understandably).|d1y8ycd|6017
That really helped me get a better perspective on how I had hurt my family and that what I had done was a deeply selfish act.|d1y8ycd|6018
I am not trying to shame people that try suicide or tell anyone that he is a bad person for thinking about it.|d1y8ycd|6019
But if you go through with what you are thinking about you are saying goodbye to everyone that loves you permanently.|d1y8ycd|6020

[BK][BK]Let me tell you about how my world used to work.|d1y8zzf|6051
Mind the rant, you cannot really turn this sort of thing into storytelling.|d1y8zzf|6052
[BK][BK]A type 1 diabetic in shit control is basically in a constant living state of a suicide attempt.|d1y8zzf|6053
You are constantly fighting to keep yourself alive while your body does everything possible to throw you into either a coma (extreme low BG levels) or into Diabetic ketoacidosys (extreme high BG levels).|d1y8zzf|6054
[BK][BK]If you take that struggle and add depression (which is statistically common in childhood onset type 1), you get a situation that can cause that living constant attempt.|d1y8zzf|6055
In fact, it is downright masochistic just how that edge is.|d1y8zzf|6056
[BK][BK]The weirdest part is that that sort of dangerous edge could be unintentional.|d1y8zzf|6057
Just not having good control can put you in that perilous medically neglectful spiral.|d1y8zzf|6058
"[BK][BK]Another issue is that lack of medication can directly cause depression and a host of other 'lethargic'"" style symptoms."|d1y8zzf|6059
Once your in the hole, it is horribly hard to climb out.|d1y8zzf|6060
Even the effort to go and get your Meds from a cabinet could be enough to wind you and force you to need a rest.|d1y8zzf|6061
[BK][BK]Even stranger, the well accepted remedy is to have a specialized doc (endocrinologist) basically yell at you.|d1y8zzf|6062
They cannot actually help you if you cannot keep up the treatments.|d1y8zzf|6063
That means that the chronic illness that allows that situation can only be improved by reducing the depression.|d1y8zzf|6064
It''s a catch-22.|d1y8zzf|6065
[BK][BK][BK]I am in better shape now but there are still moments that I have to work incredibly hard to keep my self stable.|d1y8zzf|6066

[BK][BK]Anyway, the main time, I almost shot myself.|d1y927i|6098

Well, this was not so much a intended suicide per-say, rather a bad event that I was going with.|d1y94ae|6123
I was caught out in a rip-tide one day along with my sister, and as we were young, we could not swim very well.|d1y94ae|6124
About that time, I was receiving the brunt of bullying in my school life.|d1y94ae|6125
So I was thinking, 'At least people will not have to deal with this annoying, awkward kid.'|d1y94ae|6126
So I kinda just stopped swimming, and began sinking.|d1y94ae|6127
[BK][BK]About 30 or so seconds underwater (like I said, I was not actually intending to die rather than go along with it, so I was not really in a rush to drown), I started getting pulled by some random bloke who happened to see me and my sister (she was being helped by my dad, who had a really bad back from an incident in the army).|d1y94ae|6128
I still was not really doing anything, rather then going along with it, so I literally was not moving anything, just being pulled.|d1y94ae|6129
We eventually made it to shore, and taken to hospital.|d1y94ae|6130
[BK][BK]I dunno if I was in shock or whatever, really still had not been feeling anything, so when we got back to where we were staying at the time, I kinda just sat around on the couch.|d1y94ae|6131
My sister was a bit more upset about it.|d1y94ae|6132
She cried about how she felt terrible about how she put me in danger, because the reason we were out there was because our younger brother and ourselves were playing a game.|d1y94ae|6133
When she admitted that, that was the first thing I actually thought since.|d1y94ae|6134
Knowing that my sister (who up until then I respected immensely but did not think cared for me, like everybody else) was worried for me rather then herself during the time...kinda just struck.|d1y94ae|6135
[BK][BK]So now, I am out of school, entering university, and gotten over the bullies.|d1y94ae|6136
Most of 'em were dickheads, and the majority of them actually had some issues of their own (some physical, some mental).|d1y94ae|6137

Why did they have to bring my parents into this?|d1y988l|6161
Couldn't I have just had my time alone in the mental hospital until discharge and then face them?|d1y988l|6162
It seemed like they were like hey lets force this kid who attempted suicide to do the next shameful thing....talk to your parents a about it when it could have been they were all or part of the reason.|d1y988l|6163
I am Asian so I felt at the time it was more shameful and embarrassing for me for them to have to see a son who attempted to kill himself.|d1y988l|6164
Being forced to talk to them at the mental hospital after was so gut wrenching.|d1y988l|6165
[BK][BK]So this is my first post ever on Reddit because suicide is a very important topic to me.|d1y988l|6166
I have been on Reddit for maybe 9 months and sometimes I will think about creating an account and posting but never get around to it but I wanted to elaborate for those who are interested.|d1y988l|6167
[BK][BK]So the first time I took 40 Benadryls and woke up deaf in one ear for the day.|d1y988l|6168
I did not tell anyone until way later on after the attempt that actually put me in the hospital.|d1y988l|6169
I was pretty freaked out but eventually my hearing came back.|d1y988l|6170

It was strange because I obviously knew where the door handle was but was so disoriented I was either hallucinating or just too messed up to get my body to rise fully.|d1y988l|6172
[BK][BK]Fast forward a few months or so later I took 90.|d1y988l|6173
I actually bought the 100 pill bottle but was taking 10 at a time in 5 minute intervals and only made it to 90.|d1y988l|6174
They said I puked up purple and started to seize.|d1y988l|6175
Apparently they forced coal down into my stomach to get me to regurgitate as much of the drugs as possible before it entered my system.|d1y988l|6176
Mind you this is a recount from my parents so I am not positive on all of the details.|d1y988l|6177
He told me the doctor said I flatlined and a defibrillator was used to bring my pulse back.|d1y988l|6178
Those who visited me said I was conscious for 3 days in the hospital but not mentally so.|d1y988l|6179
They said I kept crossing my eyes and seemed to just not be there.|d1y988l|6180
I do not actually remember any of it.|d1y988l|6181
My first conscious memory is walking with an IV into the mental hospital where I stayed for 10 days before being discharged.|d1y988l|6182
Luckily my parents did not approve the anti depressants because I did not want to take them either especially considering I was 16.|d1y988l|6183
I had heard that they cause more issues with mental stability prior to 18 but that was about 8-9 years ago.|d1y988l|6184
[BK][BK]|d1y988l|6185
'How am I alive?|d1y9rgj|6186
"'""[BK][BK]It''s hard to remember - I was in the hospital, in and out of consciousness for the first day, and for the next two days I slowly regained my cognitive abilities."|d1y9rgj|6187
But during my conscious moments I journaled to myself - the thoughts were coherent and complete, but the words were broken, with words starting late or ending early, as if I lost consciousness mid-sentence.|d1y9rgj|6188
[BK][BK]In those scribbles, my first thoughts were wondering what happened and how I would survived.|d1y9rgj|6189
The next thoughts were of terrible, paralyzing fear.|d1y9rgj|6190
[BK][BK]I attempted for a very specific reason - based on the information I had at the time, terrible events in my future were a certainty, and I made a rational decision that dying would be more merciful than living through them.|d1y9rgj|6191
Thankfully, my information was wrong, and I survived to learn as such.|d1y9rgj|6192
[BK][BK]To this day, however, none of us know how I survived.|d1y9rgj|6193
"By all rights, I should be dead."""|d1y9rgj|6194
Shit i better clean this up before somebody finds me|d1y4dgp|6195
Not really my first thought, but after awhile, I soon realized that when they say it gets better, they are likely lying.|d1y4l72|6196
I believe my life will improve by the time I start going to college and move out, but it was supposed to get better 3+ years ago.|d1y4l72|6197
Well my suicide attempt was a mixture of tablets at 3am in the morning 2 years ago.|d1y99cn|6198
I took a mix of psychiatric medication as I had not long been discharged from the psych ward and every other tablet I could find in the girlfriends house.|d1y99cn|6199
This included prescription strength painkillers, asprin and many more.|d1y99cn|6200
I think in total the police counted 400+ tablets had been opened from previously closed boxes.|d1y99cn|6201
[BK][BK]I do not remember even getting to the hospital, or even the emergency services being called but I was in intensive care for 7 days and i had to be resuscitated twice.|d1y99cn|6202
Eventually when I came too, apparently I said to the doctors, why did you not let me go peacefully.|d1y99cn|6203
[BK][BK]Nevertheless, I was filled with guilt as my parents come in to see me, tubes everywhere machines bleeping, heart monitor all over the place.|d1y99cn|6204
[BK][BK]Several hours later I was taken to a ward for a week long review.|d1y99cn|6205
Kidneys and liver were heavily hit during the OD but thanks to doctors I guess I am OK now.|d1y99cn|6206
No permanent damage, except for some flashbacks.|d1y99cn|6207
[BK][BK]Part of me wishes I was still successful and I do not regret what I did but I am now moving on in life with a lot of mental health support.|d1y99cn|6208
[BK][BK]|d1y99cn|6209
I had a rough breakup.|d1y9gyp|6210
Was sitting in my bathtub sobbing with a loaded .45 1911 in my mouth.|d1y9gyp|6211
Pulled the trigger but for some reason it did not fire, I ended up dropping the gun, texting my mom to come pick me up and to check me into a hospital.|d1y9gyp|6212
Ended up spending 5 days in the psych ward, crying at night as all the thoughts haunted me, how I would never hear my dad's laugh again, or feel the unconditional love that my mom exudes.|d1y9gyp|6213
Or holding my cat at night when I am having a terrible day.|d1y9gyp|6214
I am glad that the gun malfunctioned, and I am glad to still be here today even though I still have days where I wish things were different, and I am slowly changing them for the better.|d1y9gyp|6215
[BK][BK]The worst thing through out the experience was the countless times how I had to tell different doctors how I planned to kill myself.|d1y9gyp|6216
At the time I had 5 different ways, all of which involved not being found by my mother; parents are divorced so no chance my dad would find me as he lives in another state; and all the while seeing the hurt on my mom's face, that look of her baby hurting as bad as he was... that was utter gut wrenching and I feel horrible for putting her through all of that but I am glad she was there for me.|d1y9gyp|6217
The other hard part was when my dad would call me at the psych ward before the visitor hours were over just to talk to me for a little bit, I broke down in tears every single time just because I would hear his voice and feel safe, that maybe everything will ultimately work out in the long run.|d1y9gyp|6218
[BK][BK]That was 7 months ago today it still hurts to think about, but I rather people know that they are not alone, nothing is worth ending your life for, no matter how shitty of a situation you are in, it is not the end of the world, someone loves you out there unconditionally.|d1y9gyp|6219
There was no real coherent thought I broke down crying, pulled the magazine out of my rifle and cleared the double feed.|d1y4iki|6220
Then broke the rifle down and started cleaning the bolt housing group and fell asleep with the pieces in my lap|d1y4iki|6221
How am I going to pay for that ambulance ride?|d1y4f0q|6222
[BK]|d1y4f0q|6223
"'I cannot even die right and now the bed is a mess.'"""""|d1y4dlq|6224
"'Huh, was not expecting a Prado to be able to break like that'""[BK][BK]Seriously, if you are going to try pick another way than death by car."|d1y4h6r|6225
"It''s just a shitty way to do it."""|d1y4h6r|6226
Need to breathe|d1y4e4k|6227
'Fuck.|d1y4f1m|6228
Fuck.|d1y4f1m|6229
Fuck.|d1y4f1m|6230
Fuck.|d1y4f1m|6231
FUCK!|d1y4f1m|6232
"Why am I still fucking here? '"""""|d1y4f1m|6233
"'This is really, really going to hurt tomorrow'"""""|d1y4q58|6234
First time I woke up blind and with a tube down my throat.|d1y9jri|6235
"I think it was 'I am sorry'"" which I tried to cry through the tube at my dad who was the only person''s voice I could understand in the room."|d1y9jri|6236
Everyone else sound like rotten buzzing and metal.|d1y9jri|6237
[BK][BK]Second time I spent the better part of a week and a half in a full bodied hallucination of mostly hell- as well as cutting up the shit out of my arms and legs while fighting against the restraints they had me in.|d1y9jri|6238
Permanently some motor function in one of my hands because of it as well as various other weird nerve damage because of the pills and amount I took.|d1y9jri|6239
[BK][BK]I had to be resuscitated both times, multiple times.|d1y9jri|6240
I really really wanted to die.|d1y9jri|6241
I do not so much anymore, especially after finally being giving the right pills at the right dosage for psychotic depression.|d1y9jri|6242
[BK][BK]If you are on the edge and considering and happen to be reading this as that internal cry for help, or self-flaggelation.|d1y9jri|6243
Well.|d1y9jri|6244
I cannot help you.|d1y9jri|6245
I know when I was in your place nothing anyone said made sense, fit me, or sounded real/genuine.|d1y9jri|6246
"I remember when I woke up in the first hospital, after a couple days I met a nurse that said '""so... you tried to kill yourself?'"""|d1y9jri|6247
"and I was like '""um.. yeah'""."|d1y9jri|6248
"She replied with, and in the most bland, boring, apathetic I-could-care-less attitude '""But you have so much to live for'""."|d1y9jri|6249
I am pretty sure I broke up laughing.|d1y9jri|6250
Just thinking about it now even seem fucking insane that she would say that to me, and like that.|d1y9jri|6251
[BK][BK]Anyway, if you are that very rare person who somehow is going through the exact thing I was going through- 1. its much worse to be suicidal and too afraid to do it because of what you experienced last time (literal, true hell, the hallucinations gave me a panic disorder and sparked off serious psychotic symptoms in my day-to-day life).|d1y9jri|6252
"Essentially truly feeling like '""you have no options'""."|d1y9jri|6253
and 2.|d1y9jri|6254
God, the world, whatever you believe in that you think is ''judging'' you so harshly and wants you for dead.|d1y9jri|6255
Think about how many people in the world there are, how many of them do not know about you and do not care about you, and then ask yourself why god or the great gaia spirit would be any different.|d1y9jri|6256
Ask yourself why they would care about you begging for forgiveness.|d1y9jri|6257
They do not.|d1y9jri|6258
You''ve been asking forgiveness of yourself this whole time.|d1y9jri|6259
Doesn''t matter how much you insist you are asking them, asking for absolution.|d1y9jri|6260
You are asking your damn self.|d1y9jri|6261
"Why then will not you just give it to yourself?"""|d1y9jri|6262
when I first came to I was in a four point restraint to the hospital bed.|d1yab95|6263
"first thought was 'fuck that did not go as desired!'"""|d1yab95|6264
spent the next month in icu as I had done enough damage to my internal organs that even though I survived the initial attempt the doctors were not sure if my body would survive the aftermath of the attempt.|d1yab95|6265
[BK][BK]good or bad I type this response about 14 years after the attempt with no major attempt since.|d1yab95|6266
I have done some psychological testings in regards to the attempt (counselling group individual etc) ive been cleared medically meaning there is no cause to the effect of bi-polar and such.|d1yab95|6267
"the attempt was simply an emotional desire that I was tired and giving up."""|d1yab95|6268
Shit now people are going to be mad at me AND I have to live.|d1y4ub1|6269
I hope it works for me.|d1y5djb|6270
"'I cannot even kill myself right'""[BK][BK]And '""damn, my ass hurts'""[BK][BK]I had tied the noose just like pictures shown, but the only reachable branch on any of the trees around snapped under my weight and I plopped on my ass in the mud."|d1y53c1|6271
I just kinda laid there after that, sobbing while being rained on.|d1y53c1|6272
[BK][BK]That was 3 years ago, my life is beyond amazing now for anyone concerned.|d1y53c1|6273
"There has not been a moment I regret it not happening."""|d1y53c1|6274
I was mortified when I just did not fall unconscious.|d1y9rli|6275
I researched so much on the internet and compiled a seemingly perfect way to guarantee death.|d1y9rli|6276
I mixed awful amounts of morphine, diclazepam and alcohol in an attempt to kill myself via respiratory failure but it was not enough.|d1y9rli|6277
[BK][BK]I even found myself the perfect spot to pass away, in a small secluded field inside the bushes where I hoped no one would find me.|d1y9rli|6278
The most painful part of the ordeal was going back home, knowing you failed to even end your own life and face the ones you love, unaware that they very nearly lost me.|d1y9rli|6279
[BK][BK]You really have to experience the dread you feel after a failed attempt to truly understand it, not that I would wish that upon anyone.|d1y9rli|6280
I had swallowed a couple of capfuls of Pine-Sol, waited for around 15-20 minutes while a thought about what I would done and the consequences of it, made myself throw it up, then blacked out and woke up the next day on the couch.|d1y9x2g|6281
My first thought was something along the lines of: 'I cannot believe this.|d1y9x2g|6282
"This cannot be real.'"""|d1y9x2g|6283
Everything seemed off and a bit distorted and I knew that my last thought before I blacked out was that I was dying and nothing was going to stop it.|d1y9x2g|6284
I felt awful in a physical sense, but relieved that I was still here.|d1y9x2g|6285
[BK][BK]My dad thought that I was just really, really sick (which, technically, I was), so he had not bothered me about going to school that day and put a blanket on me at some point.|d1y9x2g|6286
When I told him about the full situation years later, he did lots of research on depression, helped me get appointments with therapists and psychiatrists, and has been there for me overall.|d1y9x2g|6287
[BK][BK]To this day, when I reach a particularly low state of mind, I think of my dad and all his support, and it gives me enough strength to push through to the end of the day.|d1y9x2g|6288
"I try to stay alive for myself most of all, but if I am honest, my father is one of the main reasons why I live."""|d1y9x2g|6289
I took 25 co-proxamol tablets when I was 15.|d1y9yoz|6290
I was all ready to go, I even in a total nerd moment looped this: https://youtu.be/hKIZCmlDrWk?t=6 in the background.|d1y9yoz|6291
"[BK][BK]All that happened was I vomited it all right back up, I assume I also 'Napoleoned'"" went into school the next day as if normal."|d1y9yoz|6292
"[BK][BK]I had several more '""attempts'"", most they were self harming through cuts - I still have the scars."|d1y9yoz|6293
[BK][BK]Around 18 things got much better, and now at 32 I still occasionally have those thoughts.|d1y9yoz|6294
"There was abuse in one form or another in childhood and mentally I have never really accepted the fact that I '""deserve'"" a good life."|d1y9yoz|6295
It''s part of a self destruction bent I have, which at the moment has taken it is form in painkiller addiction.|d1y9yoz|6296
I also have an auto-immune disease, so on really bad days that helps drag me down further.|d1y9yoz|6297
[BK][BK]Sadly these things you sometimes never get over.|d1y9yoz|6298
Occasionally I will think that my wife would be far better off with the mortgage paid off and nice pot of £100,000 from my death in service benefit.|d1y9yoz|6299
I have not actively tried since I was a teenager, and I seem to be fairly bullet proof with the painkillers.|d1y9yoz|6300
Long ago I should encountered renal damage, but nope.|d1y9yoz|6301
They are fine.|d1y9yoz|6302
Due to my illness I have full bloods every 6 weeks and always normal.|d1y9yoz|6303
[BK][BK]Frankly I am glad I live in the UK.|d1y9yoz|6304
"If I would had access to firearms, well I would not be typing this now!"""|d1y9yoz|6305
The first thing I remember is waking up to my friends banging on my door and barging into my flat.|d1ya3o3|6306
I would been unconscious for 3 days, because I had snorted a strong sleeping drug.|d1ya3o3|6307
The last thing I remember before passing out was a feeling of utter peace and happiness, since I felt like I was finally fading away and leaving all my problems behind.|d1ya3o3|6308
[BK]My friends got me to the hospital where I was incoherent.|d1ya3o3|6309
I was hooked up to an IV, which I managed to rip out, and I remember asking the nurse for a paper and pen so I could write a strongly worded letter to David Cameron about the state of the mental health services.|d1ya3o3|6310
(Haha)[BK]After I became lucid again, my first conscious thoughts were of shame, guilt, and embarrassment.|d1ya3o3|6311
My dad had been in everyday and I know it killed him to see me that way.|d1ya3o3|6312
[BK]All in all, I was in hospital for a week, and when I got home I just felt even worse than I had done.|d1ya3o3|6313
[BK][BK]Since then, I have still struggled a lot with severe anxiety and depression, but I have promised myself to stop all the self harm and suicide attempts.|d1ya3o3|6314
I have relapsed a couple of times, but I am getting there.|d1ya3o3|6315
I realised I was fed up with being a prisoner to my own mind, and if over 7 years the NHS were only going to prescribe me useless pills, I would take matters into my own hands.|d1ya3o3|6316
I bought myself a book on mindfulness, and it is really helping.|d1ya3o3|6317
I am optimistic I will be 'fixed' by the end of the year, and my only regret is waiting so long to do so.|d1ya3o3|6318
[BK][BK]My advice to anyone in a similar position: If you are feeling hopeless, worthless, and like life is pointless, the best thing to do is to talk to someone close to you.|d1ya3o3|6319
You can only bottle up your feelings for so long before they overwhelm you.|d1ya3o3|6320
Don't be proud.|d1ya3o3|6321
Talking about how you feel is not a sign of weakness.|d1ya3o3|6322
Things can get better.|d1ya3o3|6323
X|d1ya3o3|6324
Bit late to the thread, but I will post it anyway.|d1yih95|6325
Good to get it off my chest.|d1yih95|6326
[BK][BK]I tried to hang myself in 8th grade.|d1yih95|6327
I was bullied a lot in middle school, could not trust my friends, picked on by teachers and students alike.|d1yih95|6328
At home my parents were always on my case about very small things, but that stacked with the school shit took its toll.|d1yih95|6329
One night after a particularly bad day, I decided to end it.|d1yih95|6330
Nothing could be worse than the life I was living.|d1yih95|6331
[BK][BK]I took a wire coat hanger and twisted it around my neck, twisted it around a clothing bar in my closet, and dropped my legs out.|d1yih95|6332
Immediately I was overwhelmed with fear and regret, and thought about my family, my brothers, everyone who I cared about.|d1yih95|6333
I felt selfish and stupid and scared, but my legs stopped working and I could not stand up.|d1yih95|6334
Slowly my vision started to fade, and I thought I was about to die.|d1yih95|6335
[BK][BK]I woke up afterwards on the ground, because the hanger had snapped at some point.|d1yih95|6336
As soon as I realized I was alive, I just started bawling.|d1yih95|6337
I was so happy that I had failed, so happy that I had not died.|d1yih95|6338
I just laid there on the ground for a long time, so happy that I was alive.|d1yih95|6339
[BK][BK]So, to answer your question, my first thought was one of relief.|d1yih95|6340
One more time|d1y52xr|6341
'...God.|d1y4zpm|6342
"Dammit.'"""""|d1y4zpm|6343
"'God damn it, maybe if I do not answer, they will go away'"" I did not even get a chance to fall asleep, I would told my best friend I cut myself really deep and I guess that was enough for her to call an ambulance."|d1ya7ni|6344
I laid there as I heard the paramedics pound on the door, eventually break the glass and let themselves in.|d1ya7ni|6345
They eventually found me and took me to the ambulance.|d1ya7ni|6346
[BK][BK]At the hospital I felt like I failed, sure, but maybe now I would get the help I needed.|d1ya7ni|6347
It took a while for any family member to show up, and it was my uncle and cousin, they said my grandma (who raised me) fell leaving the other hospital my grandpa was in when she heard about me and tried to run, she broke her cheek bone and had to get stitches.|d1ya7ni|6348
They did not say much, did not seem very concerned and eventually left to go check on my grandma.|d1ya7ni|6349
[BK][BK]Eventually my grandma showed me, by now I had drank my 4 bottles of charcoal and puked several times.|d1ya7ni|6350
She of course was upset but only made me feel worse by saying she cracked her face trying to get to me, I still blame myself.|d1ya7ni|6351
She left within half an hour, had to go check on grandpa because he did not know what was going on, so I was alone again.|d1ya7ni|6352
[BK][BK]And I was alone for several hours, waiting to be transferred to the hospital with the psych ward.|d1ya7ni|6353
Being alone and still feeling like the least priority did not make me feel better.|d1ya7ni|6354
What did was the nurse who kept checking on me.|d1ya7ni|6355
He brought me a portable dvd player and some movies to keep me busy, he checked on me a bunch and said he would been where I was, and that really helped.|d1ya7ni|6356
"[BK][BK]"""|d1ya7ni|6357
[serious] after many different attempts since my child/teen years I nearly succeeded at hanging myself in the closet 5 years ago.|d1yiqhz|6358
I was hanging, became unconscious, somehow ended up on the floor and came to, my first thoughts were: 'fuck my life, it didnt work.|d1yiqhz|6359
how did i get down from there?|d1yiqhz|6360
why is my body feeling so numb everywhere?|d1yiqhz|6361
i need someone.|d1yiqhz|6362
"'""[BK][BK]Had marks all over my neck, face, bloodshot eyes etc."|d1yiqhz|6363
Couldnt hide those marks so people eventually knew what id tried to do and my family made me feel like shit when they saw those marks.|d1yiqhz|6364
"jeez, when you make me feel that way,i wonder why i had tried to suicide in the first place..."""|d1yiqhz|6365
Honestly just felt kind of empty.|d1yjk9j|6366
Ashamed of myself.|d1yjk9j|6367
The thoughts of everyone I knew slowly forgetting about me and moving on with their lives terrified me.|d1yjk9j|6368
I did not care about who I would have hurt by dying, rather I cared about who would be able to move on without much of a thought, like I had from friends and acquaintances who had died.|d1yjk9j|6369
It is narcissistic, I know.|d1yjk9j|6370
But honest.|d1yjk9j|6371
I simply did not want to disappear forever.|d1yjk9j|6372
And I was disappointed that all my depression and one moment of extreme weakness lead to nearly erasing myself from existence.|d1yjk9j|6373
I was young, and thought my pellet gun was powerful enough to do the job.|d1yjci3|6374
It took a good long moment to realize I had not succeeded.|d1yjci3|6375
"My first thought was 'fuck'"" my second though was that I had shot  through my temple and hit my eye somehow and blinded it."|d1yjci3|6376
It''s was terrifiying.|d1yjci3|6377
"What really happend was there was so much blood, it was covering my eye."""|d1yjci3|6378
"Two of the times it was, 'How the fuck am I still alive and how the fuck did I not vomit all those pills back up?'"""|d1y4zih|6379

 'I couldn''''t even manage to disappear.|d1yabd9|6383
"i cannot even get this right'""[BK][BK]This was my final attempt a few years ago, when one of my friends found me, and told me that if I ever did this again and managed it, she would follow me, because I was the only good thing in her life back then."|d1yabd9|6384
[BK]Thanks to her I am still standing, and have not done it since.|d1yabd9|6385
But it is harrowing when you suddenly find  yourself breathing when you should not be, when you discover yourself on the floor with a snapped rope.|d1yabd9|6386
I would tried multiple times and each time after I asked myself why did I want to do it.|d1yabd9|6387
Why did I want to disappear.|d1yabd9|6388
[BK]I am glad I had her, if I did not I probably would not be here anymore, because thosee thoughts do not go easily.|d1yabd9|6389
[BK]Even these days I find myself occasionally, when times get really hard and I end up feeling alone, wishing that I would managed it.|d1yabd9|6390
Even thinking how to do it fast and easy.|d1yabd9|6391
[BK][BK]But it is not worth it anymore.|d1yabd9|6392
Despite the dark sides you gotta look to the happy sides, to the people who care, even when they do not seem to, or when they are angry with you, or when they ignore you.|d1yabd9|6393
[BK]Because as much as you want to disappear to make sure they are happy, because you feel you drag them down, in the end you hurt them more when you go.|d1yabd9|6394
"[BK][BK]Thank you '""M.G'"" for teaching me that."""|d1yabd9|6395

I have not personally tried to commit suicide, but my best friend did.|d1yap8a|6418
She tried to take a bunch of pills to overdose.|d1yap8a|6419
I remember trying to take care of her after and get her to the hospital, but she refused to go.|d1yap8a|6420
I remember her being absolutely out of it, confused, she said she was numb, and she had a lot of blurry vision.|d1yap8a|6421
The next day she tried to go to work and was not much better, and her coworker finally made her to go the hospital.|d1yap8a|6422
She ended up getting 5150'd and they released her the next day, did not pump her stomach either.|d1yap8a|6423
[BK][BK]I do remember her being very upset, angry, and depressed that she did not die and she ended up being 5150'd.|d1yap8a|6424

Thankfully, after having her first daughter she is been doing a lot better.|d1yap8a|6426
She also had a son about a year later.|d1yap8a|6427
She is been getting help for her anxiety and depression and I have seen a huge change in her.|d1yap8a|6428
[BK][BK]I can tell you that it was one of the worst experienced of my life, it was heart breaking.|d1yap8a|6429
I felt not good enough to help her, I felt helpless.|d1yap8a|6430
I know there was nothing you could do, but when my best friend, who is like my sister, tried to die on purpose...|d1yap8a|6431
It was just horrible.|d1yap8a|6432
[BK][BK]It has now been about 4 years since the incident, and we lost a friend due to liver disease.|d1yap8a|6433
After that she came to me an apologized for ever putting me through that grief and she would never do it again.|d1yap8a|6434
I, of course, appreciated the gesture but told her she did not have to apologize.|d1yap8a|6435

I had been getting bullied for years and I did not really care or think of it much till recently and it got to me so much that I could not take it.|d1yk134|6439
If you saw what I had posted earlier I said I had drank to try and kill my self but it did not work, so I did the same thing but tried lean and other drugs with it.|d1yk134|6440
As it had hit me before I was even dead I felt dead, but I finally had passed out.|d1yk134|6441
I woke up the next day maybe at 7-8 in the evening, my parents and brother had been gone the whole weekend and I woke up and just started vomiting everywhere.|d1yk134|6442
After that I still felt off, and sick almost but nothing of the night before and it scared the shit out of me.|d1yk134|6443

each time I have an episode I get less and less scared, more and more impulsive.|d1yash5|6459
[BK][BK]it was a few days after Christmas.|d1yash5|6460
my sleep schedule was really fucked up, i did absolutely nothing all day, and I had been mentally screwing with a guy twice my age because I was so unhappy with myself.|d1yash5|6461
my mom (I am a teenager btw) came in at like 8 AM and I was still awake.|d1yash5|6462
she started yelling at me for doing nothing and sleeping all day.|d1yash5|6463
"I was really apathetic and just kept saying '""ok.'"" I was too tired to care."|d1yash5|6464
She slammed my door and I fell asleep.|d1yash5|6465
[BK][BK]I woke up at like 5pm.|d1yash5|6466
I do not really know what was going through my head.|d1yash5|6467
Probably barely anything.|d1yash5|6468
I went downstairs and locked myself in the bathroom and got the Arsenal of pills out because I found where my mom hid them.|d1yash5|6469
She was in the room right next to me.|d1yash5|6470
[BK][BK]I just kind of lined them up.|d1yash5|6471
It was almost like I was playing with them at that point.|d1yash5|6472
Then I started slowly taking them.|d1yash5|6473
I had been in there for a while.|d1yash5|6474
"My mom heard the sound of pills being '""shaken'"" so she came to the door and told me she knew what I was doing."|d1yash5|6475
She was not all that panicked.|d1yash5|6476
She got a screwdriver and started unscrewing the door handle,obviously taking her time.|d1yash5|6477
So I just said fuck the rest of the pills I lined up, emptied a bottle of sleeping pills into my hand and took them all at once.|d1yash5|6478
[BK][BK]i am really tiny.|d1yash5|6479
108 lbs and not even 5 feet.|d1yash5|6480

"My mom finally got the door open, said '""really?'"""|d1yash5|6482
and I just walked past her.|d1yash5|6483
It hit me almost immediately.|d1yash5|6484
As I was walking up the stairs I started feeling really heavy...really out of it.|d1yash5|6485
I just sort of fell onto my bed and was staring at the ceiling.|d1yash5|6486
[BK][BK]my mom came in my room and started saying the stuff she usually does.|d1yash5|6487
I do not even remember what she said, everything about my life and me was blurry as I was laying there.|d1yash5|6488
I felt my heart slowing, it was getting really hard to breathe.|d1yash5|6489
"I was struggling to keep myself awake...and then I thought '""oh fuck, am I dying?"|d1yash5|6490
"'""[BK][BK]Then I felt completely disassociated."|d1yash5|6491
The REAL me could not speak.|d1yash5|6492
It was kind of like...my subconscious was speaking?|d1yash5|6493
I just remember crying for my mom.|d1yash5|6494
"Just saying '""mom, mom'"" as she stood in the doorway and said nothing."|d1yash5|6495
I could not even turn my head to look at her.|d1yash5|6496
I passed out.|d1yash5|6497
[BK][BK]I woke up a little bit later and started choking on my own vomit.|d1yash5|6498
I ran to the bathroom and continued throwing up.|d1yash5|6499
I was really disoriented, and still found myself calling for my mom.|d1yash5|6500
My little brother saw (3) and got my mom to come upstairs.|d1yash5|6501
She just stood there and watched me gag/vomit.|d1yash5|6502
"Then, in the most apathetic tone, said[BK][BK]'""You better just go to the kitchen and drink some milk'"" before walking away."|d1yash5|6503

I am glad you started this thread, hopefully experiences can be read to help save other people.|d1ykwxz|6508
[BK][BK]I tried to kill myself Janurary of last year by ingesting a mix of amphetamines, prescription sleeping medicine, and acetaminophen.|d1ykwxz|6509
I was in my bathroom waiting to die, when I realized what I was doing was not going to solve my problems.|d1ykwxz|6510
The things I went through were purely material, and had no impact on my future.|d1ykwxz|6511
I knew my decision was a mistake as soon as I swallowed everything.|d1ykwxz|6512
[BK][BK]I immediately called my mother, told her my situation, and she hauled ass to my home while I made myself throw up.|d1ykwxz|6513
All I could do was apologize to her, but she said I had nothing to apologize for.|d1ykwxz|6514
She was just glad I was still with her.|d1ykwxz|6515
[BK][BK]I checked into a hospital, took up yoga, and left with a new outlook.|d1ykwxz|6516

[BK]Then last year I spent the week getting drunk by myself and took my motorbike out and purposely crashed into a truck, I missed by an inch and instead broke the shit out of my leg.|d1yen6r|6530
[BK]I did not tell anybody I tried to kill myself so people purely think I am retarded now.|d1yen6r|6531

I was 15 when I was diagnosed with depression and I attempted Suicide at 16 (and then again at 17)[BK][BK]I attempted to hang myself with some rope that I bought from the local hardware store.|d1yaumd|6533
I had enough of pretty much everything at that time, school grades were low, friends turned into bullies and my family were abusive and just down right horrible to me ever since my grandfather past away (when I was 3)[BK][BK]It was a thursday night and when my grandmother was not near my room that is when I tied a noose from the various videos and instruction things I read online and I got a chair from the kitchen which was a few feet away and i remember hanging for about 5 sec.|d1yaumd|6534
I felt the pressure on my neck and felt extremely hot as i kicked the chair from under me.|d1yaumd|6535
the rope eventually broke and I fell to the ground.|d1yaumd|6536

I had rope burn and I was there for 1 month.|d1yaumd|6538
I could not have coat hangers, shoe laces, string anything that I could hang myself with, no mobile phones, no computer besides the one in the mental institute part which was for 'learning only' Family would call up those in there with me.|d1yaumd|6539
There was about 18 rooms I was in the 8th room and it was a mix of boys and girls under 20.|d1yaumd|6540

I do not know if this counts as survival, but I remember the feeling of a few dozen adderol hitting my blood stream, and through the manic fear and anxiety came a sudden animalistic urge to live.|d1yelrn|6661
I induced vomiting and then just sat in the bathroom for hours ashamed and unsure of what to do.|d1yelrn|6662
I never told my parents, or basically anyone else for that matter.|d1yelrn|6663
I woke up to see my sister crying her eyes out and my parents calling 911.|d1ygaoe|6664
I untied the failed noose from my closet and just laid beside her in my bed as she wept, sad that i tried but grateful i didnt die.|d1ygaoe|6665
"All i could think was 'Fuck... i wish they didnt see me like this'"" and in a way, wishing it had worked because of that."|d1ygaoe|6666
But also overwhelmed with how deeply they cared.|d1ygaoe|6667
"[BK][BK]I have not tried since then."""|d1ygaoe|6668
better make the most out of it then.|d1yfzvk|6669
I was like, ' What the hell just happened?|d1ygcbf|6670
"'"", as I woke up in a hospital bed twitching and convulsing."""|d1ygcbf|6671
I woke up on the bathroom floor staring at the ceiling after trying to slit my wrists (I did not cut deep enough or... Something) my wife was out of town..|d1ygbps|6672
"I remember thinking 'my bathroom sucks, did I really want it to be my last image?'"""|d1ygbps|6673
And..|d1ygbps|6674
I have not tried again.|d1ygbps|6675
[BK][BK][BK]...|d1ygbps|6676
"I am scared I will again."""|d1ygbps|6677
"'Suicide is a permanent answer to a temporary problem.'"""|d1yg4ps|6678
""""|d1yg4ps|6679
'That charcoal stuff that they gave me to absorb the pills I took is going to make my shit black?|d1yg72w|6680
"Fucking sweet.'"""|d1yg72w|6681
""""|d1yg72w|6682
I tried to starve myself to death last year and from all the vomiting and cramps and my hair falling off I could tell I was succeeding, and then suddenly came this moment where I blacked out softly like I did not even realize it and I thought I had finally died.|d1ylkb7|6683
[BK][BK]I saw my now fiance's face in my head.|d1ylkb7|6684
So clear and so beautiful.|d1ylkb7|6685
They were crying and I guess it was a delusion but that was my first thought.|d1ylkb7|6686
Fuck, my cat probably should not be licking up all that blood.|d1yn79y|6687
Tried cutting my wrist.|d1yn79y|6688
Even numbed it up with lidocaine which I stole from the hospital I worked.|d1yn79y|6689
Cutting it up to about the radial artery when I saw my cat lapping the blood of the floor which kinda snapped me back to reality.|d1yn79y|6690
Didn't stich it up, it healed ok. Nobody suspects this of me so if anybody would ever comment on my faint scar I will say something along the lines of a drunk night and a glass sliding door.|d1yn79y|6691
[BK]I actually like the scar because it reminds me that I am so much better even when I have a bad day.|d1yn79y|6692
I tried again, first attempt was hanging as well, then I got my gun, really I was not able to pull the trigger because the thought of a loved one finding me that way.|d1ygg1p|6693
I ended up glad that I chose to live life is so good now.|d1ygg1p|6694
I wondered why I had such a bad taste in my mouth and why sleeping pills would cause you to spew up something black.|d1z5du9|6695
I did not know about the charcoal technique until 2 days later when I noticed how black it was in the toilet after going #2.|d1z5du9|6696
I was 19 at the time.|d1z5du9|6697
[BK][BK]I am very glad that my life was saved, I was able to move on from the whole ordeal, and I wish more people realized that life can change and things does get better if you seek help and support.|d1z5du9|6698
The thing is with a gun, you either pull the trigger or someone catches you and thinks it is a good idea to wrestle it out of your hands.|d1yb8zr|6699
Either sheer courage or complete reckless abandon has to overcome you if you think it is a good idea to put yourself in harm's way.|d1yb8zr|6700
[BK][BK]Well, when the woman I loved, the person I never wanted to seen hurt, has had it with the relationship after 3 years of living together said enough was enough, everyone is running high on emotions.|d1yb8zr|6701
The thought of being abandoned after I had envisioned living a life beyond myself was about to peace out, I could not control myself.|d1yb8zr|6702
I was no longer present mentally.|d1yb8zr|6703
I felt like I was observing everything.|d1yb8zr|6704
After 5 years in the Army this was what was going to kill me, I just felt numb.|d1yb8zr|6705
The only thing I could consciously do was give up my gun.|d1yb8zr|6706
I did not want to hurt her or anyone in the apartment compound since 5.56 rounds penetrate sheet rock like nothing.|d1yb8zr|6707
[BK][BK]After all my years of service, I was not about to hurt anyone else in my selfish act.|d1yb8zr|6708
I gave up the gun.|d1yb8zr|6709
I opened the door.|d1yb8zr|6710
I emptied my pockets.|d1yb8zr|6711
I waited till the cops showed up.|d1yb8zr|6712
I complied.|d1yb8zr|6713
[BK][BK]To this day, I have not been able to be recover.|d1yb8zr|6714
My number was up that moment, and whoever existed then died.|d1yb8zr|6715
I have not been able to hear his voice ever since.|d1yb8zr|6716
All my childhood memories just seem like some vivid memory that someone else lived.|d1yb8zr|6717
I am a husk of my former self, someone that everyone who does not know what happened still look to me for guidance and inspiration.|d1yb8zr|6718
I am just fake version of my former self who is merely impersonating him.|d1yb8zr|6719
[BK][BK]The only thing I am doing now is existing so all the people who claim to love me do not have to actually deal with me no longer physically being here.|d1yb8zr|6720
If I could, I would erase my existence and try to reform some new life, but I know that is not going to solve anything.|d1yb8zr|6721
I just do not want to bear this identity I have anymore.|d1yb8zr|6722
"'I am so glad I told someone before I bled out'"" [BK][BK]My mom was drugged out on fentanyl patches and would pass out with a lit cig in her hand all the time."|d1yw0sy|6723
She got better, then worse, then better.|d1yw0sy|6724
[BK][BK]That was when I was 14.|d1yw0sy|6725
I am 23 now, married to a man who would give me the world on a silver platter, and the most amazing kid I could ever dream of.|d1yw0sy|6726
I have had friends successfully end their lives in the years since then.|d1yw0sy|6727
If you are feeling hopeless or thinking of going that route, please just stop to consider that life DOES get better.|d1yw0sy|6728
"I will spare you all of the '""suicide is a long term solution to a short term problem'"" shit because that is already been said here, and it is true."|d1yw0sy|6729
"Just know that although I do not know you, I love you and I will always root for you. """|d1yw0sy|6730
do not remember it entirely, but i think i almost laughed out loud.|d1zi439|6731
the only thing preventing that was the fact i was scared shitless as to where i was  [BK]  [BK]subconsciously I am pretty sure i felt i was still alive, but the humor came in just as i realized that I would failed yet again.|d1zi439|6732
so much of a failure that i cannot even fucking die properly.|d1zi439|6733
fuck all of it, really|d1zi439|6734
I have tried 2 times.|d1ybqis|6735
It was a time in my life when my girlfriend had broken up with me, I was 17, and I became severely depressed and had panic attacks.|d1ybqis|6736
I thought noone would ever want me again and the loneliness was brutal and crushed me completely.|d1ybqis|6737
We still lived together and I had to watch her bring home lots of boys, I am a girl so that felt extra weird, did I drive her to become straight?|d1ybqis|6738
[BK][BK]Well onto det gory stuff.|d1ybqis|6739
We had a extremely small bathroom and no ventilation in it, i covered it all with towles and had a small gas container, turned it on and waited.|d1ybqis|6740
I passed out and then i heard screams suddenly and someone hitting me in the face, it was my ex.|d1ybqis|6741
She had come home one day earlier from her new BF.|d1ybqis|6742
I begged her to not call an ambulance and the condition was that i seek help.|d1ybqis|6743
I hated myself even more, I could not even kill myself properly, and noone loved me.|d1ybqis|6744
Fastforward a bit.|d1ybqis|6745
I got diagnosed with borderline (wronly so).|d1ybqis|6746
And got better.|d1ybqis|6747
I met a boy and started college.|d1ybqis|6748
[BK][BK]Suddenly it all crashed.|d1ybqis|6749
My boyfriend broke up with me and I started to fail every exam in my university studies.|d1ybqis|6750
That meant I got no more money for my studies.|d1ybqis|6751
I decided I was done with life.|d1ybqis|6752
Fuck everything.|d1ybqis|6753
I had read online that you could kill yourself with bitter almonds, in high doses it becomes like cyanide.|d1ybqis|6754
So i stuffed myself with a lot of pills first, anxiety medication and then 400 almonds.|d1ybqis|6755
It was a hard job I tell you.|d1ybqis|6756
I felt like my breathing was stopping I stopped seeing straight, everything became light and I was so happy cause I would get to die.|d1ybqis|6757
I do not believe in god or another life so I was excited for the fact that everything would just end.|d1ybqis|6758
"Suddenly my phone rings and stupid and 'high'"" as I am I answer it, it is a friend who hears I sound strange."|d1ybqis|6759
She calls an ambulance and they break into my apartment and I am rushed to the hospital.|d1ybqis|6760
Got my stomach pumped and some kind of clear red IV that would counter cyanide.|d1ybqis|6761
I once again hated myself and was so disappointed I failed.|d1ybqis|6762
I was the hospitals come and must see for all doctors, they have never heard of anytyhing like killing yourself with almonds.|d1ybqis|6763
A shrink at the hospital came over and talked to me.|d1ybqis|6764
I took her about 10 minutes and she suspected I had Bipolar disorder.|d1ybqis|6765
[BK][BK]She was correct.|d1ybqis|6766
[BK][BK]Today I still struggle with life but realize that when everything feels like I have hit bottom, just wait.|d1ybqis|6767
It will get better, and get help!!|d1ybqis|6768
I have medication that have saved my life today and a wonderful fiancee and soon a degree in sociology.|d1ybqis|6769
"[BK][BK]( sorry if my english sucks, I am swedish)"""|d1ybqis|6770
"'Fuck... Do I try again?'"""|d1ybyju|6771
[BK][BK]I had hung myself with a belt, I was pretty young at the time, probably around 12 or 11.|d1ybyju|6772
"It was mainly due to bullying, lots of kids told me '""kill yourself'"" on a daily basis."|d1ybyju|6773
So that and just the added stress of my the constant fights with my parents pushed me to a breaking point.|d1ybyju|6774
[BK][BK]So yeah I hung myself with a belt and when I did I blacked out and woke up to find the belt loop slipped.|d1ybyju|6775
[BK][BK]I sat there for what felt like hours, when in reality it was probably just 30 minutes.|d1ybyju|6776
"Then decided not to try again at the time I was still somewhat religious and considered it a '""sign from God'"" to not try again, or some kind of second chance."|d1ybyju|6777
[BK][BK]My parents did not know for years, unlike most people I wish they had found me.|d1ybyju|6778
Part of the reason I was pushed to a breaking point was constant fights with my parents.|d1ybyju|6779
"Which would end with me locking myself in a room and repeatedly punching myself in the face while crying to '""punish myself for being a bad son'""."|d1ybyju|6780
I had hoped if they found me they would ease off of me and get me help.|d1ybyju|6781
My looking back I am pretty sure suicide attempt was a cry for help.|d1ybyju|6782
[BK][BK]I had actually told my parents around 4  years later about my suicide attempt, in an attempt to get some therapy to move past the issues that pushed me to that point.|d1ybyju|6783
"The response I got was '"" You did not attempt to commit suicide!"|d1ybyju|6784
You''re lying.|d1ybyju|6785
"At the most you just THOUGHT about it'""."|d1ybyju|6786
"I love my parents but sometimes they can be really cold."""|d1ybyju|6787
I remember slightly coming to in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, which they have told me did not happen but I clearly remember it.|d1zc8we|6788
"[BK][BK]However, my first conscious thought when I *actually* came to, was *'I am going to have these gashes on my wrists for the rest of my life'""* and I broke down crying, only for a few minutes though."|d1zc8we|6789
[BK][BK]I then just went completely numb, and decided if I was gonna be stuck here, I was gonna make it count.|d1zc8we|6790
Not because I wanted to be alive, trust me, I did not.|d1zc8we|6791
I still want to die, every fucking day.|d1zc8we|6792
"I chose to make it count because I refused to go through that process of failing again. """|d1zc8we|6793
The only time I had actually almost succeeded had put me in a coma for a couple of days, and then, at some point, I had coded, so they put me on life support.|d1yc4uk|6794
I was in and out during the beginning of it, as I could feel them placing the electrodes(?)|d1yc4uk|6795
on my scalp (the monitors).|d1yc4uk|6796
I thought they were getting ready to perform some kind of brain surgery on me.|d1yc4uk|6797
*Maybe I had died and they were just getting ready to harvest organs.|d1yc4uk|6798
*[BK][BK]Then I sank into a place where I did not exist and nothing around me existed and there I was not in this nonexistence, just kind of *being* and *not being*.|d1yc4uk|6799
[BK][BK]The first thing I heard upon resurfacing was the clock on the wall.|d1yc4uk|6800
Just kind *tick.tick.tick.tick.|d1yc4uk|6801
*'ing it is way forward.|d1yc4uk|6802
It was very loud.|d1yc4uk|6803
Then that faded somewhat behind the sounds of footsteps.|d1yc4uk|6804
And then those footsteps faded behind the sounds of voices.|d1yc4uk|6805
And then those voices faded behind the sounds of machines.|d1yc4uk|6806
And then those machines faded behind the rest of the noises coming from the area of the hospital I was in.|d1yc4uk|6807
[BK][BK]There was a pain in my throat, and I was unable to move.|d1yc4uk|6808
And then I remembered the last thing I heard when I had begun to black out in the beginning.|d1yc4uk|6809
[BK][BK]*He's pissed himself.|d1yc4uk|6810
*[BK][BK]And then I knew where I was and what was going on.|d1yc4uk|6811
And this machine was breathing for me, and there was a tube coming out of my dickhole, and there was a steady, rhythmic beeping going on beside me, and my dad was there, looking tired, and this whole scene was familiar.|d1yc4uk|6812
[BK][BK]And I wished I had succeeded *this* time because I ***hated*** coming to in hospitals and I ***hated*** seeing the aftermath of my pisspoor decision making, and I ***hated*** having to explain myself to people who were just going through the motions of *what did you take* and *how much did you take of it* and *why did you take it*, and I ***hated*** not having what I thought they wanted me to have in the way of answers because depression and psychosis and attempting suicide do not make sense and the reasons do not make sense and there are not always reasons to begin with.|d1yc4uk|6813
[BK][BK]I left two days later after spending a day in the psychiatric unit and being of sound enough mind to do what I always did best: talk my way out of anything.|d1yc4uk|6814
It's been 11 years and I have not thought about suicide seriously since.|d1yc4uk|6815
I consider that chapter in my life closed.|d1yc4uk|6816
Pain...|d1z08a8|6817
I had tried to hang myself and the rope snapped.|d1z08a8|6818
I wish I could say I had existential thoughts about my family or some such...|d1z08a8|6819
But I was so panicked and in so much pain that I was trying to tear the rope off my neck for minutes after it had already gone.|d1z08a8|6820
[BK][BK]I had almost no control at that point, my body's survival instincts had taken over.|d1z08a8|6821
Once I could breathe again the rest of the pain hit: my legs from where I would fallen; my neck was bleeding from where my weight had worn through the skin; the blood vessels in my eyes had burst; I was a total mess.|d1z08a8|6822
[BK][BK]I sat against a tree and sobbed for goodness knows how long.|d1z08a8|6823
I called my mother because I was terrified I would try again and I did not want to because it hurt so damn much.|d1z08a8|6824
Even years later I am still terrified that I will try again.|d1z08a8|6825
Late to the party and not keen to overload on all these survivor stories in one got, so i thought i would share my story while reading.|d1ycpsc|6826
[BK][BK]My father successfully gassed himself when i was 14.|d1ycpsc|6827
[BK]Before this, i had planned and set my destiny date.|d1ycpsc|6828
After finding my father and dealing with the after math, I soon tried looking positive again.|d1ycpsc|6829
[BK]Fast forward 14 years.|d1ycpsc|6830
I have 2 young kids of my own.|d1ycpsc|6831
That drone is getting louder.|d1ycpsc|6832
That hole is getting deeper and darker.|d1ycpsc|6833
The blackness is chasing me HARD!|d1ycpsc|6834
I start digging into my throat with my pigging knife.|d1ycpsc|6835
My (then) SO rips it from my hand before i could get more than an inch.|d1ycpsc|6836
[BK]I admitted myself into a local mental health institute and spend then next month and a half recovering.|d1ycpsc|6837
[BK]That was a little over 5 years ago now and have now retrained in a field where i can help others feeling rough, i have minority custody of my kids and am loving life.|d1ycpsc|6838
[BK][BK]I am here to have a yarn with anyone that might be feeling like just reaching out.|d1ycpsc|6839
Stay Strong Live Long.|d1ycpsc|6840
Never alone!|d1ycpsc|6841
When I wa 17 (33 now) I decided enough was enough and decided to end it all by taking 50 or 60 generic PM sleep pills.|d1z7vtg|6842
"[BK][BK]The first thing I remember from the hospital was my mom standing there in tears ask/cry/screaming 'what have you done?!'"""|d1z7vtg|6843
"and I sat up straight (still on a severe acetominophen high) and denied doing anything"""|d1z7vtg|6844
It was kinda scary.|d1z8zup|6845
I had stopped myself, and I found some scissors that were in my reach and cut the jumprope I had used.|d1z8zup|6846
I brought up suicide and how I wanted to do it again, and I got bullied.|d1z8zup|6847
I hate myself.|d1z8zup|6848
I am sorry.|d1z8zup|6849
"'my mom is going to be SO mad,  and this is going to cost SO much money'"" [BK][BK]"""|d1y60m8|6850
I have had partial memory loss after a suicide attempt.|d1ycjsi|6851
I overdosed on my prescribed anti depressants and was in the hospital for three weeks.|d1ycjsi|6852
I remember nothing of those three weeks nor do I remember what made me decide to take my own life.|d1ycjsi|6853
I remember going to sleep that night crying and drifting into the darkness but that is it.|d1ycjsi|6854
I was conscious (but not all there according to family members) about 2 days later after being moved from CCU to ICU after being in a medically induced coma.|d1ycjsi|6855
My heart stopped a couple times the night of.|d1ycjsi|6856
When I became fully cognitive three weeks later I was a different person.|d1ycjsi|6857
I was no longer depressed and 6 months later was weened off my medications completely.|d1ycjsi|6858
This happened about 4 years ago and I still have no memories of that time period.|d1ycjsi|6859
I only know what I have been told from family members.|d1ycjsi|6860
I feel that there is a lot missing from my childhood memories as I can only call back upon two or three memories.|d1ycjsi|6861
I think my depression began when my father passed away and he was not very present in my life but I still can only recall one memory of him.|d1ycjsi|6862
the hardest part about repressed memories is not knowing what you have forgotten.|d1ycjsi|6863
I hope that one day I will remember again but I am also scared that if I remember again I may become depressed again.|d1ycjsi|6864
what if I forgot all of that stuff for a reason and that is the reason I am not depressed anymore?|d1ycjsi|6865
The human mind is a hell of a thing.|d1ycjsi|6866
The thoughts had been swirling in my head for weeks and I kept thinking I should try to run out into the road and get hit by a car.|d1z4wkg|6867
I zoned out so much, next thing I realise I was at the front door already.|d1z4wkg|6868
That kept happening everyday.|d1z4wkg|6869
[BK]Then I sat on the edge of my bedroom window, suddenly I started having thoughts about what would happen if I took off.|d1z4wkg|6870
Yeah, that did not happened either.|d1z4wkg|6871
[BK]I was really young back then that other suicide ideas did not occur to me as an idea (like hanging, drug overdose etc).|d1z4wkg|6872
I was not brought up with movies and had limited TV access so I never knew.|d1z4wkg|6873
"[BK]Right after the last cowardly 'attempt'"", I thought about the people that loved me, close friend and baby brother and sister."|d1z4wkg|6874
"I would give up everything for them."""|d1z4wkg|6875
Some one I had not seen in years decided to stop in randomly and found me.|d1z3yb0|6876
She got me down but really didnt say a lot.|d1z3yb0|6877
To this day she is the only person who knows this about me.|d1z3yb0|6878
I did get help.|d1z3yb0|6879
It took about 4 years of trying different things, but I got my bp1 under control.|d1z3yb0|6880
Im now living medication free which is nice.|d1z3yb0|6881
[BK][BK]Whats scary is my partner keeps talking about suicide and I just do not think I can cope.|d1z3yb0|6882
It just keeps triggering all the bad memories and he says theres nothing good in his life anymore (including me, which cuts me right through).|d1z3yb0|6883
even worse, I have no idea how to help him.|d1z3yb0|6884
Leaving is not really an option.|d1z3yb0|6885
I dont want to turn my back when the person I love is unwell.ental heakth funding cuts mean they dont take it seriously until there been an attempt.|d1z3yb0|6886
He does not believe in medication or therapy.|d1z3yb0|6887
It sucks.|d1z3yb0|6888
Whenever he talks about suicide I just cry because I dont know what to do to help him.|d1z3yb0|6889
I tried to od as a teenager, a friend kind of caught wind of what i was doing and told his parents who then called my mom.|d1ycy2g|6890
I was really pissed at the time, felt like my trust had been betrayed or some stupid shit like that.|d1ycy2g|6891
I lost a good bit of my motor functions for a bit and was close to blacking out by the time my mom busted through the door.|d1ycy2g|6892
I had to be carried around everywhere at the hospital and they made me drink charcoal, i could not do it on my own so the nurse had to bottle feed it to me like i was a child.|d1ycy2g|6893
I do not remember much about it, but i remember feeling embarrassed about the whole ordeal.|d1ycy2g|6894
[BK][BK]I think the first thought that i had is still the kind of thinking that keeps me going now.|d1ycy2g|6895
"'whatever, i guess I will live then.'"""|d1ycy2g|6896
I guess after realizing that i had not succeeded i just thought, that is it, it just was not meant to be.|d1ycy2g|6897
Really threw a lot of people off, including my therapist.|d1ycy2g|6898
I went from having really intense suicidal ideations to just kind of being okay with living.|d1ycy2g|6899
"Shit happens i guess."""|d1ycy2g|6900
My ex fiance tried.|d1yczjb|6901
We were together for a few months at the beginning but he was still missing his ex at the time.|d1yczjb|6902
He called me one night, saying he had a knife and he will kill himself if I did not call call his ex.|d1yczjb|6903
Instead I called the police.|d1yczjb|6904
They found him in the bush, bleeding and they took him to hospital.|d1yczjb|6905
He was in the mental ward overnight, but he talked his way out.|d1yczjb|6906
He admitted later on to me that he was not ready to leave.|d1yczjb|6907
Months later, he said that he had burned himself and had his arm wrapped up in bandages.|d1yczjb|6908
I saw his arms later.|d1yczjb|6909
They were not burns.|d1yczjb|6910
His arms have so many scars, they are like tattoo sleeves.|d1yczjb|6911
But when you love someone, you learn to look past the scars.|d1yczjb|6912
You learn to see them for who they really are, and people look at him all the time like he is crazy because of his arms.|d1yczjb|6913
But he is brave and pretends not to notice the judgemental stares.|d1yczjb|6914
He tried again and he said to me that the pain after cutting his wrists was the worst pain he is ever felt.|d1yczjb|6915
It was so bad he never wanted to try it again, at least not that way.|d1yczjb|6916
We are not together any more but people like him need a guardian angel to look over them and to take away their pain, mental or physical.|d1yczjb|6917
For the people who feel such a deep level of sorrow and pain seem to also love and feel the universe in an equally profound way.|d1yczjb|6918
We need more people like that to stay in this world.|d1yczjb|6919
I hope he forever does.|d1yczjb|6920
"My first thought was more or less:   [BK]'Screw it (it was a little more vulgar but you get the point), this will not kill me so I guess I will go to bed'""   [BK]I did not really think about what I would tried to do but I did not realize it until a few days later."|d1zait8|6921
"It''s been about a few months now and I still want to die but it is no longer big on my to-do list, ever since I have actually been feeling pretty good."""|d1zait8|6922
I worded that horribly.|d20e2xb|6923
What I meant was that the system records the liquids going through and if it notices that there is a breach and turns itself off so you do not get an air bubble in your bloodstream.|d20e2xb|6924
Sorry about that|d20e2xb|6925
My family.|d1ydbiy|6926
[BK][BK]Through the most intense suicidal thoughts this comes to my mind.|d1ydbiy|6927
I hate the fact of this barrier.|d1ydbiy|6928
How they are gonna feel and cope.|d1ydbiy|6929
I cannot stand continually living everyday handicapped.|d1ydbiy|6930
I am on the autism spectrum, have bipolar disorder, and ADD.|d1ydbiy|6931
I have to be drugged just to stay 'sane'?|d1ydbiy|6932
I dropped out of university cause my intellect is not enough to be there, let alone the lower vocational trades jobs.|d1ydbiy|6933
I cannot even do anything!|d1ydbiy|6934
Even the basics of driving a car.|d1ydbiy|6935
Most of the time thinking, I wish I was not born, I wish my mum did not meet my dad because he has aspergers and because of that, I am witnessing their five sons, my brothers, literally fighting, arguing, smashing things between each other virtually everyday.|d1ydbiy|6936
My dad's the most threatening at this.|d1ydbiy|6937
I cannot stand it, I hate autism.|d1ydbiy|6938
[BK][BK]I feel alone.|d1ydbiy|6939
Who's gonna be at my funeral if I die?|d1ydbiy|6940
I am sad at how I cannot maintain friends.|d1ydbiy|6941
Stuff people take for granted.|d1ydbiy|6942
I do not look like I have autism, so I can make friends but cannot maintain them, I get liked and approached but am not socially intuitive.|d1ydbiy|6943
I have lost a lot of friends.|d1ydbiy|6944
I am upset of how the world is promoting acceptance of autism rather than seeing it as a disorder and the need to prevent and fix it.|d1ydbiy|6945
[BK][BK]I still get feelings of death.|d1ydbiy|6946
I have tried everything from psychology, and yes psychiatry.|d1ydbiy|6947
7 years of everything - if you have name it, I have tried it.|d1ydbiy|6948
It's a cause that is unknown.|d1ydbiy|6949
I hate autism.|d1ydbiy|6950
I am tired of staying 'sane'.|d1ydbiy|6951
I have attempted suicide too many times so far and each and every time I hate myself increasingly more and more for not going through with it.|d1y59bb|6952
[BK]For the past two hours I have been considering it.|d1y59bb|6953
[BK]It'd be perfect, it is storming here right now so the people I live with might not hear the gunshot as a gunshot.|d1y59bb|6954
[BK]Life is shit and will not stop being shit.|d1y59bb|6955
That I was such a weakling.|d1y2z8x|6956
That moment was when I lost all emotion and remorse.|d1y2z8x|6957
There's no happy or sad any more no lump in my throat when I was in distress.|d1y2z8x|6958
It's pretty great honestly.|d1y2z8x|6959
Now I am a person who thinks people who commit suicide are the biggest wastes ever.|d1y2z8x|6960
Glad I read this.|d1y6bui|6961
Been though a similar situation.|d1y6bui|6962
Indeed the depression sometimes gets a hold of me.|d1y6bui|6963
Mentally I have to be tough to see the better side of things.|d1y6bui|6964
It does get better with time.|d1y6bui|6965
Although the depression still lingers.|d1y6bui|6966
I have better days than bad days.|d1y6bui|6967
I am glad you are still alive and doing well.|d1y6bui|6968
I wish you all the happiness, love and positive energy ❤️❤️❤️|d1y6bui|6969
Shit shit shit shit this is embarrassing.|d1y66zs|6970
Im such a pussy i cant evem do that right.|d1y65o6|6971
TL;dr - tried OD''ing, did not die, thankful for life and vowed to never commit again[BK][BK][BK]I tried to silently commit suicide without anybody knowing through overdosing on over-the-counter medication.|d1yd295|6972
At the time I did not see a point in life and I was just a teenager going through tough times (break-up and depression overall), so I decided why not end it all.|d1yd295|6973
[BK][BK][BK]In the end I came up with overdosing because I felt that it would hit me without knowing it.|d1yd295|6974
I ended up taking two full bottles of Tylenol PM extra strength expecting to die from liver failure.|d1yd295|6975
"It was a funny feeling at first, as soon as I took the first bottle I had already begun to regret, and after the second, I was absolutely devastated, like 'what the hell did I just do?!'"""|d1yd295|6976
As I went to sleep expecting to die, I began to involuntary cry and I absolutely knew I was going to the other side.|d1yd295|6977
[BK][BK][BK]Fortunately enough, I was awoken in the middle of the night with terrible pains, and I hurriedly rushed to the toilet and proceeded to vomit tons and tons of what seemed like reddish solids, and oh boy it hurt like hell.|d1yd295|6978
I was hovering over the toilet for almost a good hour, hell I am beginning to remember the feeling typing this out.|d1yd295|6979
I could not drink or eat anything without the feeling of vommitting for almost four weeks.|d1yd295|6980
"[BK][BK][BK]After all was said and done though, I was glad to be alive and vowed myself to never do anything that stupid again."""|d1yd295|6981
suicide|d20vwee|6982
When I saw my dad holding my hand in the hospital where I had my stomach pumped I honesty had no words of feelings...|d30vcsp|6983
I truthfully never thought about the people I loved and how deep that would hurt them until I saw the damage it did to my parents...|d30vcsp|6984
Even today they constantly are checking up on me and making sure I am okay.|d30vcsp|6985
Honestly I kept thinking how do I even go from here...|d30vcsp|6986
I was back to the reality that I am back to square one but now it is even worse because look at the damage I have caused.|d30vcsp|6987
Save.|d24y4k1|6988
i gotta get the fuck out this hospital immediately, holy fuck im in the most pain i have ever felt, kill me.|d2k9273|6989
all simultaneously.|d2k9273|6990
i woke up after a 5.5 week coma to find myself restrained to my bed, ~which was not really necessary, atrophy had left me completely unable to move~.|d30q6kr|6991
at first i did not know why i was in the hospital, my husband told me i was in an accident.|d30q6kr|6992
[BK][BK]as my husband and i talked i realized that alot of the dreams i had while in my coma had elements of reality woven into them as my brain was picking up stimulus from the environment around me.|d30q6kr|6993
my dreams were very vivid and clear and i remember in 3 of them committing suicide.|d30q6kr|6994
so i asked my husband if i was there because I would committed suicide and his face told me all i needed to know.|d30q6kr|6995
my first thought/feelings, shame and guilt.|d30q6kr|6996
To be honest, I felt a moment of clarity .|d1y6437|6997
I realized that I was here for a reason and that I could be a light for those in the dark.|d1y6437|6998
Since then I have been involved in various interventions  and such.|d1y6437|6999
I woke up to see a nurse standing by me.|d1yd5s4|7000
The first time I tried to commit suicide I was 14,and was found in a park.|d1yd5s4|7001
My first thought / feeling...|d1yd5s4|7002
Embarrassed.|d1yd5s4|7003
Which quickly turned to anger, and sadness, as the nurse told me my family was notified but refused to come see me because I was just looking for attention.|d1yd5s4|7004
I had failed tests, failed relationships, but nothing felt as crushing as knowing you failed at dying.|d1yd5s4|7005
I live in a small town, so I also knew everyone else would know.|d1yd5s4|7006
And somehow it made me feel like the biggest piece of shit.|d1yd5s4|7007
I would describe it as crushing, overwhelming pressure.|d1yd5s4|7008
[BK][BK]My second time I was 17, I had drank a ton of booze, and then proceeded to swallow every pill, medication I could find in the bathroom.|d1yd5s4|7009
My neighbour found me on the floor as my parents and brother were away in Germany.|d1yd5s4|7010
When coherent enough to understand what was going on I sort of felt like, this is the second time, maybe I am not supposed to die.|d1yd5s4|7011
Because people keep intervening.|d1yd5s4|7012
So I asked the nurse if I could stay for a bit, get myself some help.|d1yd5s4|7013
Still felt embarrassed, still felt like a bag of shit.|d1yd5s4|7014
[BK][BK]I am 27, actually tomorrow's my birthday, so 28.|d1yd5s4|7015
No more attempts, but definitely a lot of suicidal ideation.|d1yd5s4|7016
I have good days and bad days.|d1yd5s4|7017
But I got tired of letting depression run my life, and the guilt, anger and embarrassment I still carry with me everyday of having two failed suicides... Or as I like to call it now, successful living.|d1yd5s4|7018
As well as every person I grew up with, went to school with, entire family.|d1yd5s4|7019
Everyone knows.|d1yd5s4|7020
Some deal with it better than others.|d1yd5s4|7021
I have never attempted suicide, but I have a friend.|d1ydjwo|7022
Let's call him X.|d1ydjwo|7023
[BK]X and I met while he was in a very dark place, over the internet.|d1ydjwo|7024
We have now been friends for three years, and let me tell you, he pulled himself out of a very, very dark place.|d1ydjwo|7025
He would attempt suicide at least once a month and every time he ended up in a hospital with annoyed parents and nurses watching him so he would not fuck with the tools.|d1ydjwo|7026
X still struggles today but as far as I know has not tried to kill himself in several months.|d1ydjwo|7027
I love him with all my heart (heh, gay) and so does his boyfriend (double gay.)|d1ydjwo|7028
He had, during attempts, cut his arms, overdosed, and jumped from his roof at least once.|d1ydjwo|7029
But he LIVED.|d1ydjwo|7030
[BK]And I get to meet him for the first time soon, and I cannot wait, and neither can he, and I am going to hug the hell out of him.|d1ydjwo|7031

I was pissed at myself because I could not do it.|d1ydh8b|7042
Of all the simple things in life, disrupting the delicate processes that govern and maintain a human life should be laughably simple.|d1ydh8b|7043
There are dozens of ways to do it and good people die by fluke accidents every day.|d1ydh8b|7044
Why should I manage to survive by luck and chance and grace when I have wanted to die so very much?|d1ydh8b|7045
[BK][BK]I was so upset, despairing and distraught, it was just this simple little thing and I could not even do that.|d1ydh8b|7046
All I had to do was slide the sharp metal a mere 2 or 3 inches between my ribs, easier than cutting a steak, and I could not do it.|d1ydh8b|7047
Hell, all I had to do was hold the knife and *fall*, and I could not do that, either.|d1ydh8b|7048
I was 14 when I figured that out.|d1ydh8b|7049
[BK][BK]Maintaining life is so damn hard, taking it should be so easy...|d1ydh8b|7050
But I have never managed to succeed.|d1ydh8b|7051
I cannot drown, I have been swimming in alligator-infested waters and they did not come near me, I have been within 12 feet of wild bull moose and grizzlies and yet I am untouched, I have been shot at and I have put myself in harm's way so much... Just by existing.|d1ydh8b|7052
I work dangerous jobs, I have lived in dangerous places, and my body itself should have killed me already.|d1ydh8b|7053
I cannot even bring myself to shoot myself because it would leave a mess for whatever unlucky shmuck finds me.|d1ydh8b|7054
[BK][BK]But I am a stubborn one.|d1ydh8b|7055
If I cannot kill myself, I tell myself I will just have to make the world a better place, a place I can live in safety and be free to be myself.|d1ydh8b|7056
It's the work of a lifetime, and it hurts...|d1ydh8b|7057
But I try to help other people as best I can, and I try to be useful, and that makes me feel a little better.|d1ydh8b|7058
"'Damn, I cannot kill myself.'"""""|d4zjz76|7059
'Oh God.|d6lk4qo|7060
"Now I really fucked up.'"""""|d6lk4qo|7061
My first attempt was when I jumped from the 2nd floor balcony when I was 6.|d75xsrr|7062
When I woke up I screamed kill me kill me kill me.|d75xsrr|7063
Second attempt was when I tried to smash my head against the wall at age 8.|d75xsrr|7064
I have just hanged myself over curtail rail inthe bathroom and the shape of the rail changed and the bar dropped as I lost conciousness.|d76eui8|7065
I woke up on the floor flailing my arms and legs uncontrollably until I fully regained conciousness and my first thought was what was I doing lying on the floor and why is the bathroom a mess.|d76eui8|7066
I obviously hit my head and now with a banging pain plus my throat hurt from the unsuccessful hanging, I do not know how long it lasted because I lost conciousness.|d76eui8|7067
"'I guess I did not actually want to die'""[BK][BK]I was going to suicide by train, told my friends goodbye, but they somehow managed to get out of me where I was."|d1y6poj|7068
I still do not know why I told her.|d1y6poj|7069
Police were called, trains were stopped, I cried all the way to the hospital.|d1y6poj|7070
I think if I ever saw those officers again I would break down in tears.|d1y6poj|7071
[BK][BK]18 months later I still feel suicidal at times, but I have managed to twist the thoughts.|d1y6poj|7072
What is the ultimate fuck you to a universe that made you a broken defective person that wants to violate basic instinct and self-destruct?|d1y6poj|7073
Stay alive and show the universe what you think of fate, a giant middle finger to life itself.|d1y6poj|7074
"I am faulty but it does not mean I do not work."""|d1y6poj|7075
Whats odd about this post is how many people seem to act like the failed attempt means they now have to go get help.|d1y6wyg|7076
I am glad that is how they reacted, but I am curious why they do not just immediately try again.|d1y6wyg|7077
Like they seem to act not like they do not really have it in them to try again, but like getting help is the only next thing, not even the logic next thing but literally the /only/ option.|d1y6wyg|7078
"'Keep trying.'"""|d1y774l|7079
""""|d1y774l|7080
Woke up in a hospital with my parents next to me.|d1yasoo|7081
They did not say a word but I felt so ashamed and realised how selfish I was when I saw the torment in my mom's eyes.|d1yasoo|7082
When you have your heart ripped out by your ex its it is hard to think of the people you you will hurt when you kill yourself.|d1yasoo|7083
[BK][BK]I had a fight with my parents and ran away all while going through a tough breakup with my ex who had already posted pics of her and her new man.|d1yasoo|7084
My friend was out of town and on vacation so he let me stay in his empty house.|d1yasoo|7085
I am not a smart man.|d1yasoo|7086
First I tried using a steak knife to saw through my wrist which was a very slow blood flow so that was fail number one.|d1yasoo|7087
I then rummaged through their cabinets eating all and any pills I could find.|d1yasoo|7088
I was watching the movie pitch black as my mind started to fade to black.|d1yasoo|7089
In my last moments I remember having a neverending itch on my balls and I just couldnt stop scratching.|d1yasoo|7090
I guess my friends girlfriend decided to go grab some stuff and found a dude with pills around him passed out on the floor with my pants down.|d1yasoo|7091
Not sure how she got me conscious but I have little memory flashes of hallucinating at her house.|d1yasoo|7092
Her dog licking my face woke me for a few moments when I look down and see spiders and centipedes crawling all over me, it was beautiful.|d1yasoo|7093
What really sucked was the dream (I hope is was a dream) of being in hell.|d1yasoo|7094
It was so vivid and scary I regretted everything instantly.|d1yasoo|7095
My parents said on the way to the hospital I was telling my dad to stop running over people on the freeway and when we were at the hospital I was speaking perfect spanish and telling the nurse I was trying to gift him that buttless robe thing they put on me.|d1yasoo|7096
When I came to, the guilt set in though.|d1yasoo|7097
I had covered my wrist wound with my favorite checkered sweat band after I had failed the night before and it was still on there.|d1yasoo|7098
Im sure they knew and figured they would not make it any worse by pretending they did not know what was under it, but I have a scar to this day.|d1yasoo|7099
[BK][BK]So I guess they pumped my stomach and yet again I had failed.|d1yasoo|7100
I got a lot of weird attention from people afterwards.|d1yasoo|7101
My friends seemed distant and quiet.|d1yasoo|7102
One girl told me I suck at life so much I cant even kill myself.|d1yasoo|7103
Honesty it never went away I still do not want to live in this shitty world but it is the people who love me who I do not want to let down.|d1yasoo|7104
I drink til I black out most nights but I keep myself alive enough so my mommy does not worry about me.|d1yasoo|7105
I have a decent job but I live paycheck to paycheck trying to enjoy what little I can until hopefully one day I wake up loving the world again.|d1yasoo|7106
But I will definitely never hurt my family by going through with suicide again.|d1yasoo|7107
What really helped was my parents acting like it never happened.|d1yasoo|7108
I dont know if thats what the doctors recommended or something.|d1yasoo|7109
I flat out refused any pills over the years when they diagnosed me with depression and being bipolar.|d1yasoo|7110
I figured I would just stop being a little bitch and get through it on my own from then on.|d1yasoo|7111
They helped me move to a new city, new highschool, new problems but there will always be problems cause life is a battle and quite the roller coaster ride.|d1yasoo|7112
Virtual reality finally getting decent and possibly starting a colony on mars has sparked an ember of hope deep down inside me.|d1yasoo|7113
Ive also adopted a puppy which helps a lot for anyone going through anything similar.|d1yasoo|7114

About two weeks ago I failed my first suicide attempt.|d7dz9zv|7118
I took a bunch of pills and got really dizzy.|d7dz9zv|7119
My mom came home and the guilt overwhelmed me so much to the point where I told her.|d7dz9zv|7120
A small part of me was hoping I would slip into a coma or would die before making it to the hospital.|d7dz9zv|7121
When I finally threw up, I did not immediately feel regret.|d7dz9zv|7122
But idk now.|d7dz9zv|7123
I was very disapointed...|d851z67|7124
I was scared of facing my family friends and girlfriend, but they all supported me and make me happy to be alive.|d851z67|7125

When I was 17 I became pregnant and learned that giving life was much easier then taking it.|d1y78tq|7140

Hey everyone,[BK]This is just a friendly reminder that discussion of suicide can be really difficult for those who are going through a tough time and may bring up some scary feelings.|d1ycgw4|7171

[BK]Otherwise, if you feel like you may be suffering from a mental illness or your thoughts/feelings are making it hard to cope, I strongly recommend trying to find an appropriate professional in your area.|d1ycgw4|7175
Just as you would see a doctor when you are sick, you deserve to take care of your mental health.|d1ycgw4|7176

Now, I did not actually ATTEMPT suicide, but I DID have a plan and was going to carry it out.|d1y8qxr|7178
I had the means to and I set a date.|d1y8qxr|7179
What I like to consider a miracle occurred.|d1y8qxr|7180
"I had been severely depressed and cut off contact with a lot of my friends to 'soften the blow'"", so to speak."|d1y8qxr|7181
"Out of nowhere one of those friends contacted me on Facebook, and I still remember what he said to me: '""Hey."|d1y8qxr|7182
I feel that we should talk sometime.|d1y8qxr|7183
I feel concerned with you and I just want to check in on you.|d1y8qxr|7184
"If you need help with anything, I will be open to talk.'"""|d1y8qxr|7185
Let''s just say that the way I ended our friendship had been harsh, so I kind of wondered why he was suddenly reaching out to me.|d1y8qxr|7186
I decided fuck it, you only live once (and that I only had a few hours left to live at that point), and ended up messaging him back.|d1y8qxr|7187
We talked on Skype for several hours.|d1y8qxr|7188
I made no mention of the suicide and probably acted pretty normal, but I suspect he knew something was going on (based on his message).|d1y8qxr|7189
"[BK][BK]Now, I needed that to preface what my first thought was after I ended the Skype call: '""Oh my God."|d1y8qxr|7190

I am fairly happy right now but sometimes it still gets rough for me and I wish I would have been able to finish before she almost found me.|d1y7nsl|7204
I will never be able to erase that experience from my memory.|d1y7nsl|7205

[BK][BK]I still wish I were dead.|d1y7s55|7209
The only reason I have not killed myself is because I had a nightmare that my Dad died and I woke up the next day feeling even more awful than my normal state.|d1y7s55|7210

The weird thing for me is that even though I was totally wasted, and severely concussed, I remember the whole thing vividly in slow motion.|d1y7stm|7222
"Also, I never did go to jail, but I did go to the hospital, and they kept me there for about a day because I told the officers I was suicidal."""|d1y7stm|7223
My first thought after waking up (which shouldnt have happened) was to try it again and finish it.|d1ydjam|7224
I had swallowed an immense amount of pills and alcohol the night before, and when I woke up I could barely stumble out of bed.|d1ydjam|7225
I went to the bathroom to throw up, and before I knew it I had grabbed a shaving razor.|d1ydjam|7226
Tried to pull the small dinky blade out and was slicing at my wrist.|d1ydjam|7227

For one, it hurt so badly and wasnt doing a damn thing.|d1ydjam|7229
And secondly, there was a panicked voice in my head telling me to stop, to just call anyone.|d1ydjam|7230
[BK][BK]I dont remember dialing my boss at work, but I apparently did and told her through tears that I would not be coming in.|d1ydjam|7231
Then to 911.|d1ydjam|7232
[BK][BK]I had a roommate at the time that was completely unaware that any of this was happening.|d1ydjam|7233
He had run out to get something for breakfast and was coming home when the first responders and police shows up.|d1ydjam|7234
I remember them coming up the front stairs slowly, hands on their guns (they didnt know what sort of mental state I was in).|d1ydjam|7235
They got me in cuffs and got me to the police car.|d1ydjam|7236
I tried my best not to make eye contact with my room mate, but it happened.|d1ydjam|7237
[BK][BK]I was cooperative, never once resisted.|d1ydjam|7238
I was just ashamed of myself.|d1ydjam|7239
Why did I call anyone before it got this bad?|d1ydjam|7240
Why did I talk to my room mate, my best friend?|d1ydjam|7241

[BK][BK]For me, I was not originally planning on trying to kill myself.|d1ydn1e|7251
I had spent the better part of 4 years having a parental figure tell me that I was worthless and that I would never amount to anything.|d1ydn1e|7252
Of course, when you first hear it, you immediately dismiss it; after awhile, however, you start to believe it.|d1ydn1e|7253

[BK][BK]I started cutting not to kill myself, but rather to dull the mental/emotional pain I was going through.|d1ydn1e|7255
I had thought about suicide, but I was determined that if I was going that route that I would just drink a cup of bleach and be done with life.|d1ydn1e|7256

[BK][BK]Last memory was on the bathroom floor, drunk, in a last moment of regret I tried, and failed, to vomit up the pills.|d1y7wu3|7266
I could not lift myself from the floor, everything felt so heavy I could not move ...blacked out in the bathroom.|d1y7wu3|7267
Woke up to my roommates cat licking me in the face, in my own bed.|d1y7wu3|7268
None of my roommates mentioned anything, but they must have found me and carried me to my bed thinking I had just been too drunk.|d1y7wu3|7269
We never talked about it.|d1y7wu3|7270
I took 34 paracetamol tablets, had a glass of orange juice, and went to bed hoping to not wake up around about 10pm, of course I did not realize at the time how long and painful death by liver failure is, I woke up around 6am with what I can only describe as the worst pain I had ever felt in my abdomen, I stumbled to the toilet and proceed to vomit for the next hour, I woke my parents up due to the vomiting and they demanded to know what was up because I was puking not sick but bright yellow bile, I told them the truth and I was ashamed, I felt relief I guess that all my bottled feelings were out in the open, it was just after a rough breakup and my life just kept tumbling down hill, this was in November 2015 when I attempted it, I spent the next week and a half on an infusion and vomiting any food or drink straight back up after an hour, that beeping noise is one I will never get out my head, to say the least the whole experience was trans-formative for me, I had a week on a ward to think about life and where I went from there, ontop of that for the first time in a long time I no longer felt alone, my friends and family came in to rally around me and pick me up from the dirt and bring me in from the cold, then just after christmas I met a wonderful new girlfriend and I never knew life could get this good, things have turned around, to anyone whose thinking about it, reach out to those around you, they are not your enemies they can help!|d1ydub2|7271

I felt like shit.|d1ydx5y|7311
[BK][BK]When I looked out, the older couple that lived in the house across the road waved at me.|d1ydx5y|7312

"'How odd is it that someone you have known for twenty years could have just been in enough pain to do something like that seconds earlier, and they wave at you and smile.'"""|d1ydx5y|7314

[BK][BK]So there I was, with my bottle of painkillers, no place to live, no future, no hope, and in really bad pain to boot.|d1yedhq|7425
I just laid in bed all morning the first day I was alone.|d1yedhq|7426
The pills were on the shelf.|d1yedhq|7427
I was thinking about how my loved ones would be sad if I was gone, maybe even devastated, but they would get over it.|d1yedhq|7428
Life goes on.|d1yedhq|7429
And at least I would not be in pain anymore.|d1yedhq|7430
And at least I would not have to deal with how pointless life was.|d1yedhq|7431
[BK][BK]I never ended up doing it though.|d1yedhq|7432
Instead, I reached out to my dad and told him what I was going through.|d1yedhq|7433
He drove over and picked me up.|d1yedhq|7434
He did not even talk to me about it.|d1yedhq|7435
No lectures or anything.|d1yedhq|7436
He just started working on helping me find a new place to live.|d1yedhq|7437
Sometimes having only one less thing to worry about is enough relief to help you go on another day.|d1yedhq|7438
Just fix one little problem.|d1yedhq|7439
It makes you feel a little better.|d1yedhq|7440
[BK][BK]Though I did not actually, physically make the attempt, I still consider myself a survivor.|d1yedhq|7441
I was pretty damn close.|d1yedhq|7442
I even had the plan, the means, and the opportunity.|d1yedhq|7443
But I reached out instead.|d1yedhq|7444
I do not even know why I did.|d1yedhq|7445
There was really no reason not to do it.|d1yedhq|7446
But when I went to bed that night, the last thought in my head was that, yeah, life is shitty and miserable.|d1yedhq|7447
But the great people out there who genuinely care and treat you decently no matter what make it worth the trouble, and the little sparks of joy in the darkness are as beautiful as stars.|d1yedhq|7448
[BK][BK]I decided to become one of those kinds of people.|d1yedhq|7449
Life might not ever get better.|d1yedhq|7450
My situation is still only marginally improved.|d1yedhq|7451
"But at least I can make other people''s days a little better, and maybe give them a little bit of that feeling of overwhelming gratitude I felt when my dad was there for me in my darkest hour. """|d1yedhq|7452
These arn't my thoughts.|d1yel3f|7453
These are from someone I knew.|d1yel3f|7454
They tried 3 times, the 3rd was successful.|d1yel3f|7455
[BK][BK]He had aome kind of mental illness,not depression.|d1yel3f|7456
I do not think anyway.|d1yel3f|7457
He heard voices in his head that told him to do it.|d1yel3f|7458
[BK][BK]I was young at the time, me and my Dad were basically lodgers in this guys house.|d1yel3f|7459
[BK][BK]My Dad saved him the first 2 times, by pure luck.|d1yel3f|7460
I was there for the second one, he had tried to hang himself.|d1yel3f|7461
Once he woke up, he told us that the voices were angry that he did not get it right.|d1yel3f|7462
[BK][BK]I was too young to understand at the time, but now I realise how awful it must be.|d1yel3f|7463
The first thing you hear after waking up is scolding from your own head, insults you cannot block out.|d1yel3f|7464
[BK][BK]I do not have too many details, sonce my father dose not like to talk about it.|d1yel3f|7465
[BK][BK]In his life, he was a great guy.|d1yel3f|7466
Amazing sense of humor, great at cooking and really nice in general.|d1yel3f|7467
He had 2 children that he left behind.|d1yel3f|7468
[BK][BK]I do not know why he did not seek help, I do not know many things on this topic.|d1yel3f|7469
[BK][BK]But for anyone feeling like suicide, look for help.|d1yel3f|7470
Even if you do not want it, do it for your loved ones, your freinds.|d1yel3f|7471
Even your pets.|d1yel3f|7472
Somone always loves you, but it can just be hidden.|d1yel3f|7473

[BK][BK]It was the EMT.|d1yhq7g|7475
He left bruises on my arm when he led me out to the ambulance.|d1yhq7g|7476
I could see all my neighbors outside to see what was going on.|d1yhq7g|7477
My second coherent thought was absolute shame and humiliation.|d1yhq7g|7478
But I also did not care much because I was still really groggy and really high on the pills I would taken.|d1yhq7g|7479
Was hoping it had still work in the ambulance but did not figure that was likely.|d1yhq7g|7480
Turns out what I would taken was not easy to OD on and they kept me fairly alert on the trip.|d1yhq7g|7481
No stomach pumping just charcoal.|d1yhq7g|7482
Worst thing I have ever had to drink and it left my stomach fucked up for days.|d1yhq7g|7483
Relief was not something I felt.|d1yhq7g|7484
My dad of course told everyone what I would done.|d1yhq7g|7485
So I had to live all that humiliation and shame again after I got out of the psych ward.|d1yhq7g|7486

He tried to hang himself a couple years ago when my dad passed away suddenly.|d1yf8jh|7500
The most recent time, he admitted it to my mom but swore her to secrecy and does not know that I know.|d1yf8jh|7501
He's 32 now and I do not know how to help him.|d1yf8jh|7502
He refuses counseling and keeps suicide like a final recourse in his back pocket.|d1yf8jh|7503
No matter how well things are going, all it takes is some hopelessness and being overwhelmed by life and it is not the type of thing I am educated to handle.|d1yf8jh|7504

Then I thought, what if it was more extreme and I survived but was permanently paralyzed and had to be imprisoned in my own body with my depression and my abusive family forever, and what if I could not even talk?|d1yf8jz|7515
So I just wait for death instead, like everyone else- but it also gives me anxiety, knowing it is coming.|d1yf8jz|7516
I drowned once, at 17, too- I know what death is like, I can wait.|d1yf8jz|7517

Hello, I realize I am a bit late here for this comment to get noticed but I decided to share my story anyways.|d1ykxmk|7634
I moved from Sweden to Spain when I was a young lad.|d1ykxmk|7635
The bullying started already in my first year I went to school there but it escalated horribly during 6th to 9th grade.|d1ykxmk|7636
Somewhere around 7th grade I was at my lowest, mentally speaking.|d1ykxmk|7637
I was the weird Swede, under-performing in math and Spanish classes and I was small in stature.|d1ykxmk|7638
The kids and even the teachers picked on me every day.|d1ykxmk|7639
One time, my classmate pushed my neck so hard, he dislocate my neck right in front of my teacher.|d1ykxmk|7640
The teacher saw the whole thing but told my parents the same day that I hurt myself in my sleep.|d1ykxmk|7641
I just had it.|d1ykxmk|7642
I had to wear a neck-stabilizer (what is it called again?)|d1ykxmk|7643
for a month.|d1ykxmk|7644
It was so embarrassing.|d1ykxmk|7645
I was sad and angry and I felt so alone.|d1ykxmk|7646
I got no support from nobody.|d1ykxmk|7647
I decided to jump off the 9th floor later that day (where I lived back then).|d1ykxmk|7648
I always pondered on suicide since I moved to Spain, sitting on the window ledge contemplating if I would feel relief by jumping.|d1ykxmk|7649
However, that day I was determined.|d1ykxmk|7650
I came home, ate my most hated meal (lentil-soup) and went to my room.|d1ykxmk|7651
I was convinced life was against me.|d1ykxmk|7652
I was angry, sad and hated everything.|d1ykxmk|7653
I hated Spain, my parents, my sister, my classmates, you name it.|d1ykxmk|7654
I went to the window, opened it and stood on the ledge.|d1ykxmk|7655
I was so filled with anger and hate I never stopped to think, I just took one big step outside but suddenly my sister pulled me in.|d1ykxmk|7656
She said nothing during this and ran to mom to tell her what I was doing.|d1ykxmk|7657
I was sitting on the floor and my family members stood around me.|d1ykxmk|7658
I had no idea what my parents where telling me as I was so consumed by my emotions.|d1ykxmk|7659
I had one thing clear in my mind, though...|d1ykxmk|7660
I wanted to kill myself but not in front of my sister.|d1ykxmk|7661
"[BK][BK]I was going to try again soon after, when my sister would go off to a camp or event of some sort but my parents 'fixed'"" the window so I could not open it and attempt to jump again."|d1ykxmk|7662

[BK][BK]A year passed, the bullying continued but my parents told me I may go back to Sweden the year after if I get passing grades.|d1ykxmk|7665
So I decided to stay alive because I had hope that Sweden could give me back the happiness and hope I lost.|d1ykxmk|7666
This might sound like a cliché but when I started high-school in Sweden, all my sadness was gone.|d1ykxmk|7667

I am glad you are still here too.|d1ybx1x|7690
I was in a long distance relationship with a girl I met on MySpace.|d1yhdyr|7691
Didn't work out but that is not important.|d1yhdyr|7692
[BK][BK]One of her friends would call me to talk about her troubles every once in a while.|d1yhdyr|7693
She had a boyfriend in the UK (we live in the US).|d1yhdyr|7694
She was kind of nuts.|d1yhdyr|7695
Didn't allow him to have any friends who were girls.|d1yhdyr|7696
Stuff like that.|d1yhdyr|7697
Although I do not know how she mediated it since he lived across the pond.|d1yhdyr|7698
I played halo with I am online a couple of times.|d1yhdyr|7699
He was really nice.|d1yhdyr|7700
It did not work out with them though.|d1yhdyr|7701
That's when things got bad.|d1yhdyr|7702
[BK][BK]She was already pretty depressed.|d1yhdyr|7703
She cut her self ect...|d1yhdyr|7704
But him breaking up with her sent her over the edge.|d1yhdyr|7705
And since I was the only person she really talked to, she latched onto me.|d1yhdyr|7706
[BK][BK]She called me one night and calmly told me that she was going to kill herself while I was on the phone with her.|d1yhdyr|7707
She claimed to have fallen in love with me, and if I did not love her back, she would swallow as many pills that she could find.|d1yhdyr|7708
So I did the only sensible thing I could think of.|d1yhdyr|7709
I told her I loved her, which was a lie.|d1yhdyr|7710
[BK][BK]But that did not stop her.|d1yhdyr|7711
A couple days later she called me and told me she had went through with it.|d1yhdyr|7712
That as we spoke she was probably dying.|d1yhdyr|7713
I managed to convince her to let me call a suicide hotline for her.|d1yhdyr|7714
The lady on the phone told me to call 911.|d1yhdyr|7715
Only problem was I did not know where to tell them to go.|d1yhdyr|7716
I lived in Florida, she lived in Ohio.|d1yhdyr|7717
And she was not calling anyone.|d1yhdyr|7718
Finally I got her mom on the phone and she took it from there.|d1yhdyr|7719
[BK][BK]I do not really know how she turned out after that.|d1yhdyr|7720
I broke contact with her because I could not handle being friends with her anymore.|d1yhdyr|7721
It was too much for a 14 year old to deal with.|d1yhdyr|7722
I do hope she is ok now.|d1yhdyr|7723
[BK][BK]She did call me my senior year and threaten to sabotage my relationship with my then girl friend (now wife).|d1yhdyr|7724
I told her off and she has not called me since.|d1yhdyr|7725
[BK][BK]I feel like she had some mental issues besides depression.|d1yhdyr|7726
I hope she got help.|d1yhdyr|7727
[BK][BK]I know this is not exactly what you asked about OP.|d1yhdyr|7728
But I felt like it was relevant.|d1yhdyr|7729
[BK][BK]If any young people here have friends that are thinking about suicide.|d1yhdyr|7730
Tell someone please.|d1yhdyr|7731
[BK][BK]|d1yhdyr|7732
'Fuck I am in hospital..why?|d1ymwmh|7733
'[BK][BK]Took me a while to remember I would overdosed, my stomach hurt so bad I thought I had appendicitis|d1ymwmh|7734
"'I cannot leave my dad.'"""|d1ym3k1|7735
The overwhelming guilt of leaving my father with my mom hit me pretty hard, but it is pretty much a temporary life extension.|d1ym3k1|7736
I think once my parents eventually pass on, I am gonna do it.|d1ym3k1|7737
"It''ll be nice."""|d1ym3k1|7738
I just cried, harder than I have in my entire life.|d1yhy32|7739
I just wanted to be done but I was convinced that life was just trying to continue screwing me.|d1yhy32|7740
[BK][BK]I swallowed every damn pill I owned (a wide variety due to being medicated for bipolar, depression, anxiety and a few other random meds) but a friend found me slumped against a basement wall covered in my own vomit.|d1yhy32|7741
He took me to the hospital and they immediately pumped my stomach.|d1yhy32|7742
When I woke up I was devastated.|d1yhy32|7743
I was mad at my friend for not letting me die, but more so I was mad at myself.|d1yhy32|7744
All I could think was how could I have been so stupid, I was already planning how my next (and final) attempt would go, how I would make sure I never had to walk this planet again.|d1yhy32|7745
I thought surely nobody on this planet was drowning in pain and misery the way I was.|d1yhy32|7746
Until I saw my mom crying.|d1yhy32|7747
[BK][BK]That's when it all shifted, my perspective became a little bit more clear all at once.|d1yhy32|7748
The pain I was feeling?|d1yhy32|7749
It was nothing compared to the pain she was having to deal with.|d1yhy32|7750
Seeing her youngest daughter laid up in a hospital bed because she tried to kill herself.|d1yhy32|7751
I knew from the way she looked at me (but never at my face) that I would caused her more pain than I ever actually experienced.|d1yhy32|7752
[BK][BK]I vowed to never do that to my mom again.|d1yhy32|7753
After a stint In a mental hospital for the suicide, pill problem and eating disorder I spent months trying to win my mom back.|d1yhy32|7754
Eventually her hugs became a little bit tighter, she started laughing again, and it was all worth it.|d1yhy32|7755
I lapsed a few times with the pill problem and the eating disorder but that was it for me, I was done with trying to be done with life.|d1yhy32|7756
I wanted her to be proud of her little girl and feel she did not fail.|d1yhy32|7757
[BK][BK]Unfortunately she passed away while I was still battling the eating disorder, but she did know I was on the final road to recovery.|d1yhy32|7758
It's been 8.5 years since my suicide attempt, and even with my mom being gone I am never looking back because who i was is who I never want to be again.|d1yhy32|7759
Disappointment, followed closely by hangover.|d1ynu61|7760
I had knocked back a few shots of gin, taken almost two dozen vicodin, and then chugged another pint of straight gin.|d1ynu61|7761
Judging from the state I woke up in, I rejected the gin and barfed everything back up before passing out on my floor.|d1ynu61|7762
There was no joy at being alive, no gratitude that I did not drown in vomit, no excitement at a second chance; I woke up face down in a pool of puke with one of the worst hangovers of my life and the knowledge that not only did I feel like a total failure at life, I was enough of one that I I could not even opt out.|d1ynu61|7763
I never got the stain completely out of the carpet and I never told a soul for about ten years.|d1ynu61|7764
I wish I could say that things have gotten better and I now have a multitude of reasons why life is beautiful and I am glad to still be here, but despite meds and therapy I still wish pretty regularly that I would succeeded.|d1ynu61|7765
Sometimes I wonder if maybe I actually did, and that a lifetime of depression and hiding behind a mask of humor and optimism is the purgatory I have been sentenced to for taking my own life.|d1ynu61|7766
At age 19 one feb or mars night i decided to hang myself.|d1yn6cz|7767
Tied a cord into a noose, put it over a door and closed it, i hade a pair of wireless headphones on repeating a certain song.|d1yn6cz|7768
I put a chair next to the door with the back faced away from the door.|d1yn6cz|7769
I kind of crouched down on the chair enough for the cord to cut blood flow to my head.|d1yn6cz|7770
[BK][BK]Suddenly the sound faded out into silence, i had passed out.|d1yn6cz|7771
Just as it faded out it began returning, a sharp pain began pulsating from the hip on my left sided, it took a while for me to realise i was lying on the floor, the room was pitch black, i got up and checked a digital clock i had in my room, some 20 minutes has passed since i had checked it just before passing out.|d1yn6cz|7772
Im guesssing that most of those 20 min was spent passed out on the floor.|d1yn6cz|7773
Looking at the cord and door i could see that it most likely had been damaged from the friction caused between cord and edge of the door when my body went into spasms.|d1yn6cz|7774
I was fucked up, kind of highish for quite a while after the incident and mostly confused.|d1yn6cz|7775
In this state i managed to break contact with a person affecting me in a very negative way though.|d1yn6cz|7776
'Well, I guess its supposed to hurt.|d1yi38b|7777
"'""[BK]I was 16 and Came home after a long Monday of being bullied, finally decidedIi was not going though another week of the shit."|d1yi38b|7778
Went to my shed and grabbed my dads thickest rope looked for ways to hang all over the house until I finally settled on the ceiling fan structure in my room.|d1yi38b|7779
Probably looped the rope around 4 times until there was just enough to fit my head/neck inside.|d1yi38b|7780
I stood on the chair watching cars drive by though the window and with a blank moment I just slowly tipped the chair out of reach.|d1yi38b|7781
It hurt like hell.|d1yi38b|7782
I thought maybe I was doing it wrong, But then again my body just wanted to relax and take the pain.|d1yi38b|7783
I kept repeating to myself its supposed to hurt  I do not know how long I initially hung there until I decided I did not want to do it anymore.|d1yi38b|7784
I ended up scratching the rope so badly my nails chipped off at the base and everything went blurry, not black i just could not see or hear.|d1yi38b|7785
Just like that I woke up in the hospital strapped to the bed and unable to speak.|d1yi38b|7786
The look on my baby brothers face seeing me strapped up with the same bloody shirt and neck is what haunts me (and keeps me alive today).|d1yi38b|7787
"No one should have to explain to him what I tried to do."""|d1yi38b|7788
 I was in a hospital and I cannot recall a single thought only because I had so many.|d1yow0r|7789
I was dehydrated, sleep deprived, had not eaten in days, and had a lot of pills.|d1yow0r|7790
[BK][BK]I was coming in and out of reality.|d1yow0r|7791
Life itself felt like a dream and I was having trouble staying conscious even though I was fully awake.|d1yow0r|7792
I heard voices in my mind so loud that they were indistinguishable from real voices.|d1yow0r|7793
[BK][BK]All I really kept thinking was I failed.|d1yow0r|7794
And now I failed even harder than before.|d1yow0r|7795

When I was 16, I slit my wrists.|d1yprpz|7798
I did not work out so 6 weeks later I OD''d on medications and spent a couple days in ICU.|d1yprpz|7799
When I came out, my family did not deal well with me and sent me back into a mental institution.|d1yprpz|7800
I felt guilty after I had done it.|d1yprpz|7801
"Not because I did not succeed but because of the pain I caused my little brother and the guilt he felt from not being able to 'save me'"" himself."""|d1yprpz|7802
I woke up after my attempted overdose and could not tell if I was still alive or not.|d1ycqhh|7803
I had a migraine and vomited a lot, and then went to school in the morning as though nothing had happened.|d1ycqhh|7804
It's been five years and I can finally honestly say I am ok, even if I am only 90% sure that this is all real.|d1ycqhh|7805
One time I tried very hard to commit suicide.|d1ysovh|7806
After a while, I realised that what I had tried was not going to work and I did not have the energy left to do something that would work.|d1ysovh|7807
So I called the ambulance.|d1ysovh|7808
I think that I first thought something like 'Oh man, that happened.|d1ysovh|7809
"I guess I gotta figure out where to go from here'""."|d1ysovh|7810
I was not grateful that I did not die, but I also accepted and was ok that I would continue to live.|d1ysovh|7811
[BK][BK]That was almost 4 years ago, I have been sober since then, and my life has been super awesome and beautiful.|d1ysovh|7812
I am grateful I did not die, and for people struggling, my message to you is this:[BK][BK]Whatever is happening, there is a way to turn it around.|d1ysovh|7813
"You may feel like shit now, but can create a beautiful life and give something precious back to the world if you try hard enough."""|d1ysovh|7814
"'Fuck'""[BK][BK]I knew I was in for a world of hurt on top of everything I was already struggling with in my life."|d1yi5gm|7815
I was so horribly unhappy about surviving that I spent months trying to work out a plan that would work, but I had to be super awesome international spy secretive about it because of having just made it through once.|d1yi5gm|7816
I was watched like a hawk, and not in the caring supportive way, in the fuck you you little shit you are not doing anything kind of way.|d1yi5gm|7817
Nobody was loving or caring or supportive in the way you had think they would be.|d1yi5gm|7818
Honestly, they all treated it as a cry for attention and they were beyond furious with me for it.|d1yi5gm|7819
"I still wish they knew it was not '""acting out'"" or attention-seeking."|d1yi5gm|7820
[BK][BK]Anyways, in those months where I planned very carefully, I started to come out of my depression.|d1yi5gm|7821
There were a few brief, fleeting moments where I was glad I failed.|d1yi5gm|7822
Those moments are still very rare, but at this point, it is too much work and causes too many problems to off myself.|d1yi5gm|7823
I also got a few degrees in psychology, which does not do much from a theoretical background, but rather in a practical sense.|d1yi5gm|7824
Being a therapist is one of the few things in life that makes me feel like I am not a total waste of elements.|d1yi5gm|7825
My dog is the primary thing that keeps me going.|d1yi5gm|7826
He turns 10 in five days.|d1yi5gm|7827
I am planning a party for him.|d1yi5gm|7828
Nobody will come, but I will plan it anyway.|d1yi5gm|7829
Planning for the future is difficult, but sometimes, just the right plans can be really helpful for keeping hope alive.|d1yi5gm|7830
[BK][BK]I still keep the option of suicide in my back pocket.|d1yi5gm|7831
It''s comforting.|d1yi5gm|7832
It does arise as my go-to first choice when things start going wrong, but I have learned to acknowledge it then put it back in the pocket.|d1yi5gm|7833

Failure to die is not great encouragement that you should not have tried in the first place.|d1yr1pt|7836

See, no one like, found me and stopped me or anything like that.|d1yr1pt|7838
What I tried just flat did not work.|d1yr1pt|7839

This was two weeks ago for me.|d1yi94e|7841
I woke up in the hospital with my boyfriend next to me.|d1yi94e|7842
I remember thinking about how fucking sorry I was for the pain I was putting him through.|d1yi94e|7843
He could not even look at me.|d1yi94e|7844
Then when my parents showed up and started screaming at him and ripping into me, I remember just desperately wanting to leave the hospital and wanting them out of my room.|d1yi94e|7845
I honestly hated them the whole time I was there, but I was too weak to even speak, let alone argue with them and tell them to leave.|d1yi94e|7846
[BK][BK]When they moved me from the medical side of the ER to the psychiatric side, the only thing I could think about was how deeply I regretted what I would done.|d1yi94e|7847
The psych ER was the worst fucking place I have ever been.|d1yi94e|7848
I did not even feel human.|d1yi94e|7849
"All I could think for the 12 hours before they moved me to a real psych ward was, 'if I had not taken those fucking pills, I would be curled up in my boyfriend''s arms right now instead of in a 6''x8'' whitewashed room with no sheets or pillows and Nick Jr on the TV while listening to some girl shrieking and running down the halls outside my door'""[BK][BK]Never again."|d1yi94e|7850
If I get to that dark place again, I am admitting myself to a psych ward because that place was actually incredibly helpful.|d1yi94e|7851
"But fuck dying and fuck the ER."""|d1yi94e|7852
I have tried overdosing twice, once on over the counter meds and once on prescription.|d1yx2jd|7853
Obviously did not work either time (unless I am a ghost or this IS hell).|d1yx2jd|7854
"My first thought upon waking both times was 'Why cannot I just die already?!'"""|d1yx2jd|7855
"Followed by '""I cannot hear anything, work is going to be a nightmare'"" (side effect of the meds I took was thinned blood, and if your blood is below a certain consistency, apparently you will not be able to hear until it thickens back up, who knew)."|d1yx2jd|7856
[BK][BK]Haven''t attempted since, but not because I do not want to.|d1yx2jd|7857
I think about it literally everyday.|d1yx2jd|7858
"In fact my first thought every morning when my alarm goes off is '""I wish I was dead'""."|d1yx2jd|7859
You know how when you have a craving for a certain food, you can almost taste it?|d1yx2jd|7860
"I can almost feel the gun barrel in my mouth and my finger on the trigger."""|d1yx2jd|7861
At the time, I was disappointed and felt physically sick.|d1ytzxl|7862
I really did not plan on waking up.|d1ytzxl|7863
I had taken a LOT of pills.|d1ytzxl|7864
The police found me later in the day and took me to the hospital.|d1ytzxl|7865
I was screaming at everyone and being non-cooperative and they sent someone into the room with a needle.|d1ytzxl|7866
I prayed that I was going to be euthanized.|d1ytzxl|7867
It was only a sedative.|d1ytzxl|7868
I was later evaluated, put on meds, etc.|d1ytzxl|7869
[BK][BK]After that day, nothing felt real.|d1ytzxl|7870
Emotions, conversations, hobbies, special interests... it all felt so empty.|d1ytzxl|7871
My psyche had finally decided to end itself but was unsuccessful.|d1ytzxl|7872
I really never felt normal after that.|d1ytzxl|7873
I am here now, though, 2 years later.|d1ytzxl|7874
Call it a miracle.|d1ytzxl|7875
I just hope I can learn to be a friend again.|d1ytzxl|7876
Not a survivor as in went all in, but did go right up to the edge.|d1yczns|7877

First thought was; oh shit it is actually working.|d1yczns|7880
Just managed to cut it off.|d1yczns|7881
Perhaps 20 sec from real problems.|d1yczns|7882

I was 19 and a Freshman in College.|d1yidw6|7892

I would never experienced a situation when I did not rise to the top.|d1yidw6|7895
[BK][BK]In college, while I was good, I was not the best and it ate at me.|d1yidw6|7896
Then my girlfriend back home broke up with me.|d1yidw6|7897
I got depressed, I started gaining weight, I was insulin dependent and quit taking my shots.|d1yidw6|7898
I quit going to classes, hanging out with friends, I quit doing really anything other than drinking, eating and playing video games.|d1yidw6|7899
[BK][BK]As the semester came to an end, I realized I was on the verge of flunking out of school.|d1yidw6|7900
I would been a part of a group in the University that represented the top 5% of incoming freshman at a school that was top 3 in the nation for Engineering, and I was going to flunk out.|d1yidw6|7901
[BK][BK]I could not take it, my pride, my self identity, all had been thrown away.|d1yidw6|7902
[BK][BK]I decided to kill myself by overdosing on Insulin.|d1yidw6|7903
But I did not want people to know I would killed myself, that was too shameful to me at the time.|d1yidw6|7904
So I poured out a 1/5th of whiskey down the drain of sink in the bathroom and put it on the floor next to my bed.|d1yidw6|7905
I then drew up 100 units of fast-acting insulin and stuck it in my thigh.|d1yidw6|7906
It would make it look like I would just gotten drunk and tried to take my insulin and in my stupor used too much.|d1yidw6|7907
As I prepared to push the plunger down, my roommate walked in.|d1yidw6|7908
He was home early from class.|d1yidw6|7909
[BK][BK]I took the needle out, and figured I would wait until he left for dinner, but instead he sat and talked with me.|d1yidw6|7910
Told me he was worried about me, and thought I should go get some help.|d1yidw6|7911
He knew I would been skipping classes and was upset about my girlfriend and said I should talk to someone, that he thought I might be depressed and I could get a waiver from my semester, so I would not flunk out.|d1yidw6|7912
[BK][BK]Then he insisted I go take a shower and go have dinner with him.|d1yidw6|7913
"[BK][BK]I told him, I needed to take my insulin and he looked at the needle and said 'P33J, that is a lot of insulin.'"""|d1yidw6|7914
[BK][BK]I pretended to be shocked and made some excuse about being distracted by the TV or something and I threw the old needle away and drew up the insulin I actually needed.|d1yidw6|7915
[BK][BK]Things slowly got better after that, I eventually graduated, got married had kids, started a good career.|d1yidw6|7916
I have been living with depression for 15 years, and when I get stressed out or if my blood sugar gets out of whack, it gets worse, but I have resolved myself to talk to someone when that happens, rather than trying to handle it on my own.|d1yidw6|7917

"'""[BK][BK]I moved out a month after I graduated high school, and two years later I am doing a lot better."|d1yd7la|7954
I am clean, I have got good friends I think, and I almost never even think about my father.|d1yd7la|7955
[BK]Just because someone is your parent does not mean they are not horribly toxic.|d1yd7la|7956
You do not owe them shit.|d1yd7la|7957
"Do what you have to do-it is not being selfish, it is fucking survival. """|d1yd7la|7958
I woke up the next morning feeling hopeless, but at the same time relieved.|d1yd6px|7959
Yes, I had failed, but my dad did not have to find my body that day either.|d1yd6px|7960
"[BK][BK]Later that month I did one of those 'FWD send to 12 people you care about'"" spams and sent one to my little brother."|d1yd6px|7961
He, being like 10 at the time thought it was a goodbye text and called my estranged mother over.|d1yd6px|7962
He was literally hysterical.|d1yd6px|7963
"Before that happened, it never occurred to me that I would be missed. """|d1yd6px|7964
My husband committed suicide 7 years ago and I have come a very long way in that time.|d1yiexj|7965
I lost my best friend, college sweetheart, confidante and everything that has ever grounded me and the fight back was more than difficult - there are not even words to describe it.|d1yiexj|7966
I still suffer from some residual PTSD and anxiety which I finally decided that I needed to take - I fought it for a long time.|d1yiexj|7967
I wanted to be strong enough without it.|d1yiexj|7968
I have often thought that I do not understand why all this has happened to me.|d1yiexj|7969
A wise friend cautioned me recently that that why question is not helpful but focus on how to get through it.|d1yiexj|7970
It made things clearer.|d1yiexj|7971
I am a better person for all this - I know it in my soul.|d1yiexj|7972
After relocation about 5 years ago, I finally took a job that was everything I ever wanted.|d1yiexj|7973
It has not yet been a year and about a month ago with no warning, my boss starting giving me a very hard time.|d1yiexj|7974
Feel like I am being treated unfairly and it is causing me a lot of stress, even with my medication.|d1yiexj|7975
I have worked really hard and it all seems so unfair.|d1yiexj|7976
I feel like I am the unfortunate scapegoat of something I could not have changed.|d1yiexj|7977
I have meeting tomorrow that I am dreading where I am either going to be fired or severely dressed down and it is all I can think about despite by best efforts.|d1yiexj|7978
It's hard not to wonder why this is happening - I keep thinking when will this all be enough?|d1yiexj|7979
Haven't I gone through the enough to finally get a break?|d1yiexj|7980
I know that is weak and counterproductive but I just want to coast for awhile.|d1yiexj|7981
My husband saw the goodness and potential in me.|d1yiexj|7982
I wish any of that mattered to anyone else.|d1yiexj|7983
I am so so tired.|d1yiexj|7984
I am trying.|d1yiexj|7985
I am praying.|d1yiexj|7986
He left me here to deal with all of this alone.|d1yiexj|7987
It seems so unfair.|d1yiexj|7988
"'I was not supposed to wake up'"" .....my wife told me that is what I said after she found me passed out."|d1yeet1|7989
"She thought I was just drunk."""|d1yeet1|7990
"After waking up, my first thought was 'you have so much to live for and for those who care about you'""."|d1ydgsu|7991
Its been 9 years since but it always remains a clear message in my head.|d1ydgsu|7992
Studying meditation, philosophy and psychology really turned things around for me.|d1ydgsu|7993
"If anyone is struggling with depression, your not alone, its completely normal and there ARE people that you can talk to that will make you feel comfortable, DONT EVER GIVE UP ON YOURSELF """|d1ydgsu|7994

"'I think its time to give sobriety an honest try'"" was my first thought waking up in the ICU with my parents crying over me after taking a bunch of tricylic antidepressants when the drugs stopped giving me any euphoria."|d1ydl8r|7996
Since that day my life has become a truly wonderful one with great friends a wonderful job and a wonderful home with many more good things still to come.|d1ydl8r|7997
I am very blessed to have a second chance at life and I do what I can to not squander it.|d1ydl8r|7998
Fellow survivors I believe there is a reason we made it through.|d1ydl8r|7999

A urgent care center was right across the street, I passed out there and woke at another hospital.|d1ydlip|8004

[BK][BK]Literally, just that single word.|d1zfb45|8006
"Because waking up meant I failed, yet again."""|d1zfb45|8007
I thought I was a failure that could not even get that right.|d1ydp3j|8008
[BK][BK]Doesn't help that the situation I was in got worse after that.|d1ydp3j|8009
I just did not have the energy anymore|d1ydp3j|8010
I was 11 years old, and I had tried jumping in front of a car.|d1ydp5b|8011
When the car missed me, I started crying and realized that I wanted too young to die.|d1ydp5b|8012
When I was 15 I took a whole shit load of TylenolPM thinking that would work.|d1z79w3|8013
"I in a daze must have vomited in a corner of my room and when I woke up I was like 'I do not want to clean that up.'"""|d1z79w3|8014

A lit of fucked up shit had happened to me in the past year so it seemed the best idea at the time.|d1z79w3|8016
[BK][BK]But IDK I just started doing my own shit and not worrying about other people.|d1z79w3|8017
And going to raves in the city and getting my own nontown friends.|d1z79w3|8018
[BK][BK]The last time, I remember I drank a shit load of Jack Daniels and hoped it would be enough to Kill me in my sleep.|d1z79w3|8019
But I did not.|d1z79w3|8020
"[BK][BK]I think my initial thought was,  '""I guess maybe I should try to get help then.'"""|d1z79w3|8021
[BK][BK]At that time I had a pretty good alcohol problem going on and nothing seemed to be working, I made meetings,  I saw a therapist but nothing was fixing that deep down I just wanted to die and alcohol was not solving that feeling anymore.|d1z79w3|8022
[BK][BK]I still deep down wish I were dead.|d1z79w3|8023
I am 32, I am overweight, and unemployed.|d1z79w3|8024
"I could hide and say,  '""but I am a stay at home mother '"" but thats a lie,  I do not want to be a stay at home mother so I am definitely unemployed."|d1z79w3|8025
[BK][BK]What keeps me not doing it is I would like to not be remembered as a huge fat ass.|d1z79w3|8026
So I have got to lose some weight.|d1z79w3|8027
And maybe, getting my masters might help with that inescapable feeling that I am m a failure.|d1z79w3|8028
[BK][BK]Tho,  I remember this from that movie about David Foster Wallace that I have been infected by this American idea that somehow some grand gesture will cure me.|d1z79w3|8029

"I am clean now. """|d1yf0a3|8042
I decided I was going to drive my car into the river.|d1yeu8o|8043
Got stuck in the mud.|d1yeu8o|8044
I then decided I was going to gas myself.|d1yeu8o|8045
So I got out of the car and realized that the back end of my car was too high to bury fully with mud.|d1yeu8o|8046
[BK][BK]At that point the whole thing was off in my mind and I needed to get a tow.|d1yeu8o|8047
My first thoughts were about how I was a fucking idiot for getting my car stuck.|d1yeu8o|8048
[BK][BK]I was on new meds for my bipolar disorder.|d1yeu8o|8049
I was in a toxic relationship.|d1yeu8o|8050
So my head was all kinds of messed up.|d1yeu8o|8051
This was my last attempt and it happened about ~6 years ago.|d1yeu8o|8052
Although I still get really depressed from time to time.|d1yeu8o|8053
Suicide has been off the table since then.|d1yeu8o|8054
some of the answers gave me many insights.|d1yeo7m|8055
I am soon to be doctor.|d1yeo7m|8056
My lecturer in psychiatry dept always and  always reminded us about the danger of depression and as doctor we need to be in constant look out for the risk and help them at best.|d1yeo7m|8057
so thank you .|d1yeo7m|8058
I was 22, and I had gone through a reasonably harsh breakup.|d1yieyj|8059
She was my first.|d1yieyj|8060
I went to the local supermarket and got strong sleeping pills.|d1yieyj|8061
I do not know if they can actually kill you, but I took about twenty and thought that would definitely do the trick.|d1yieyj|8062
Woke up dehydrated as fuck, and very disoriented.|d1yieyj|8063
I do not know how much time had passed.|d1yieyj|8064
I was still living in the house with the ex and her boyfriend (My best friend at the time) and I stumbled to get water.|d1yieyj|8065
The only thing going through my mind was how pissed I was that it did not work.|d1yieyj|8066
I went on that way for three years with severe depression and self-harm with frequent thoughts of suicide.|d1yieyj|8067
[BK][BK]The day I started to love myself was just one month ago.|d1yieyj|8068
I realized people love me and care about me and that I am a good person.|d1yieyj|8069
My internal agony disappeared completely.|d1yieyj|8070
I am able to feel more, care more, do better things, lose weight, eat healthier, and kick my habitual drinKing into occasional drinking.|d1yieyj|8071
I have honestly never felt better.|d1yieyj|8072
The cause of all this?|d1yieyj|8073
Another breakup.|d1yieyj|8074
Funny how that works.|d1yieyj|8075
My ex, while not right for me, she taught me how to take care of someone, and when she left I directed that knowledge on myself.|d1yieyj|8076
I thank her for that, and now that I have happiness, I am glad my soul is still contained in this plane of existence because the world needs me, and I need it.|d1yieyj|8077
It feels honestly amazing and I am proud of myself.|d1yieyj|8078
My story is not exactly a suicide story.|d207ldw|8079
I never was at the point where I was going to do it.|d207ldw|8080
I thought about it, I wanted to, so many times.|d207ldw|8081
There was one time which I describe as the worst moments of my life, I had reached my lowest point and before I did anything I met two important people.|d207ldw|8082
My best friend and my girlfriend.|d207ldw|8083
I owe my girlfriend my life, she truly saved me.|d207ldw|8084
The bullying passed and all I became happier then ever before.|d207ldw|8085
To all the people thinking about suicide, find someone, a friend.|d207ldw|8086
Talk to them, it passes.|d207ldw|8087
Even if you think it will never get better, it does.|d207ldw|8088
I am now starting my own company to try to combat bullying and I never imagined my life could be this great!|d207ldw|8089
Hang in there :)|d207ldw|8090
My first thoughts were very unclear because I was still under the influence of several hundred pills - including a month's worth of Ambien.|d1yf41i|8091
I remember thinking about my wife and how bad I felt that she would had to drive home because from a business trip because she could not find a flight to come to the ER.|d1yf41i|8092
Well...|d1yex3r|8093
It was like...  Shit shit shit!|d1yex3r|8094
And then good, I never wanted to die.|d1yex3r|8095
It was a realization to be honest.|d1yex3r|8096
Gave me the realization that I need help and well fuck I am a hell of alot happier now after kicking out my mentally abusive girlfriend.|d1yep4t|8097
I felt used and worn out when I gave up, went black, and opened my eyes after being found by my dad.|d1yep4t|8098
Agreed to never tell the world but he set me up for so much help and potential in my life.|d1yep4t|8099
Touched me even more with guilt knowing my best friend committed suicide when I was in gradeschool.|d1yep4t|8100
I was 18 at the time.|d40njqc|8101
This was in 2013.|d40njqc|8102
[BK][BK]I would just come home for summer vacation from college.|d40njqc|8103
I would been out as trans at the campus, and accepted by everyone there.|d40njqc|8104
So coming back home to my conservative catholic family...piled on top of years of untreated mental illness and the creeping fear that I would never be a good enough adult.|d40njqc|8105
Something had to give.|d40njqc|8106
[BK][BK]I would told a friend that I would run away that night and be homeless.|d40njqc|8107
But I was to afraid to.|d40njqc|8108
So, I looked up every possible way to die, then decided the easiest would be hanging.|d40njqc|8109
[BK][BK]Luckily, there was not any fucking rope.|d40njqc|8110
But I was fucked up enough to try anyway.|d40njqc|8111
What I did have was some really strong thickish string that I just tied into a noose and prayed would last long enough.|d40njqc|8112
[BK][BK]Now, you say first conscious thought.|d40njqc|8113
And that, honestly, makes this question really hard to answer.|d40njqc|8114
"Because I was probably slipping in and out of consciousness for a while, and I do not know how 'conscious'"" one of the most memorable parts could be considered."|d40njqc|8115
So I suppose I will write down the play-by-play.|d40njqc|8116
[BK][BK]I remember finally working up the nerve to jump off of the chair, then clawing at the shelves I tied myself to.|d40njqc|8117
The next thing I remember is gasping for breath.|d40njqc|8118
For a little bit, that was the only sensation I had, just forcing air into my lungs.|d40njqc|8119
I was on the ground at this point, the rope had broke.|d40njqc|8120
But I could not feel it at all.|d40njqc|8121
I only realized I would hit the ground later, and only because...well, I must have.|d40njqc|8122
[BK][BK]I do not know how long the gasping lasted.|d40njqc|8123
But at some point, I started hallucinating.|d40njqc|8124
Or something.|d40njqc|8125
I do not know what I would call the experience.|d40njqc|8126
But it is incredibly sharp in my mind.I remember I was absolutely certain that there were two other people in the room with me.|d40njqc|8127
I did not know who or what they were, but I did not feel unsafe or scared.|d40njqc|8128
Well, not by them at least.|d40njqc|8129
I remember I thought I had to breathe to talk to them, and I forced myself to gasp in air so I could get out the words.|d40njqc|8130
I begged them to go downstairs to the kitchen, because there were scissors there, and they could save me.|d40njqc|8131
And one of them told me that they could not do that...that I had to save myself.|d40njqc|8132
[BK][BK]I managed to worm my fingers between the swollen skin of my neck and the broken noose, and ripped it off of me.|d40njqc|8133
"[BK][BK]The first completely rational thought I had after my attempt, after managing to pull myself onto my bed, was '""Why the fuck cannot I open my eyes?'"""|d40njqc|8134
Turned out the reason was that my face was swollen up like a balloon.|d40njqc|8135
"[BK][BK]And my last '""first'"" thought, when I woke up the next morning, was '""how the fuck do I get to the hospital without my parents knowing?'"""""|d40njqc|8136
"Ineffectively attempted to overdose nightly for 9 months...[BK]Literally the only thought that ever came was 'shit, guess ill try again tonight'"""""|d1yfo9t|8137
"Mine was as simple as 'better get to dinner before my dad screams at me some more.'"""""|d1yfoyc|8138
Suicide prevention is very serious!!|d1yfpie|8139
If people try to kill their self and do not succeed, they really do not want to take their own life to begin with.|d1yfpie|8140
They need counseling ASAP.|d1yfpie|8141
I have lost a few friends to this.|d1yfpie|8142
I always ask myself what if they they would have called?!|d1yfpie|8143
?|d1yfpie|8144
I felt ashamed, I did not tell anyone for over a year I just cleaned up my bathroom and pretended nothing happened.|d1yhfpt|8145
Probably going to get buried but my first thought was that I had less of a reason to live.|d1yjlm2|8146
I broke it off with a girl I was seeing at the time so she did not have to go through any pain, this also destroyed our friendship as it turned out that she had experienced overdoses so hated me.|d1yjlm2|8147
[BK][BK]It also got me ridiculed as someone I trusted like a sister made joked behind my back in college, caused me to study from home for a month and not work for 2.|d1yjlm2|8148
It also caused me to get hooked on codeine for months which made me very out of it.|d1yjlm2|8149
[BK][BK]However it did show me that someone did care, I messaged another girl I was close to basically crying out after I had overdosed.|d1yjlm2|8150
Saying sorry, have a good life etc.|d1yjlm2|8151
The next day she called me early in the morning to check if I was okay and met with me a few days later for a chat.|d1yjlm2|8152
[BK][BK]Also someone I kayak with told me we were going out on the canal to help me clear my head.|d1yjlm2|8153
For two hours we did not talk at all just kayaked in silence which helped.|d1yjlm2|8154
[BK][BK]I forgave the 2 people who turned on me as they both apologised.|d1yjlm2|8155
However I never forgave my stepdad who never knew about my overdose but when he discovered I was off work called me selfish and never spoke to me for days.|d1yjlm2|8156
Even now as I am a big guy from powerlifting my coping method if I get stressed is to cool down as I have a huge temper which very rarely comes out but when it does can be destructive.|d1yjlm2|8157
He does not see me cooling down but yells at me for walking away from situations I do not like.|d1yjlm2|8158
[BK][BK]Not the best idea to someone almost 100kgs of muscle with a temper.|d1yjlm2|8159
One time he started shouting in my face with my mum doing nothing and me trying to reason with him.|d1yjlm2|8160
That did not work so as he was trying to intimidate me I lost it and shouted back how he would not like it if I shouted at him.|d1yjlm2|8161
This caused him to push me back.|d1yjlm2|8162
[BK][BK]Side note I have a dodgy knee due to the weights I lift and if anyone does anything to possibly hurt it, it is the only time I get physical.|d1yjlm2|8163
He also had me cornered which is not a good idea.|d1yjlm2|8164
I pushed him away, grabbed my car keys and ran out the house.|d1yjlm2|8165
I did not care about repercussions at that point I wanted out.|d1yjlm2|8166
[BK][BK]I did return hours later and agreed to be civil with him.|d1yjlm2|8167
It also drove a wedge between me and my mum as she knows why I leave and come back to stressful situations once I calmed so I can think rationally but she just watched it and did not say a word.|d1yjlm2|8168
[BK][BK]Since his mum died he has been very civil to me but I still do not forgive how he acts towards me.|d1yjlm2|8169
Know that I moved over 150 miles away to uni my mental health has levelled however I still have panic attacks but not as often.|d1yjlm2|8170
But I will never forgive him for that.|d1yjlm2|8171
I have tried hanging, myself during life.|d1yh9ou|8172
Since I listen to a lot of metal music, and I listen to quite a lot of Mozart and Beethoven.|d1yh9ou|8173
At the age of 12, I was being bullied for my height and weight.|d1yh9ou|8174
It carrie on until I decided to hang myself when my mother caught me getting ready for my death.|d1yh9ou|8175
[BK][BK]Another time was when I was 14, and I had been beaten up and rejected by a lot of people, even some friends, I tried it in school, and I had to go to a psychologist.|d1yh9ou|8176
[BK][BK]And a few months ago, August I remember.|d1yh9ou|8177
I tried suicide again.|d1yh9ou|8178
"This time I decided 'I am going to drink bleach and try that.'"""|d1yh9ou|8179
I never did it, but I tried cutting one of my ears off then killing myself, by self inflicted knife wound.|d1yh9ou|8180
[BK][BK]But it never worked.|d1yh9ou|8181
"To be honest, I feel as though I am no one. """|d1yh9ou|8182
"'Fuck.'"""""|d1yygg8|8183
"Honestly, my first thought was 'nothing will be the same again'""."|d1yhdzf|8184
I was in the hospital texting the people who absolutely had to know, and I realized that I could not go back to where I was before I would attempted, and scared the shit out of me.|d1yhdzf|8185
A week inpatient, a huge scar on my wrist, and my mom completely devestated.|d1yhdzf|8186
Unfortunately the life I was thinking about when I decided to call 911 was over, and I was so depressed about what I would fucked up by trying to kill myself that I tried to kill myself again the day after Christmas.|d1yhdzf|8187
"Model fucking son, right here."""|d1yhdzf|8188
To be honest, my first thought was 'What the hell just happened?|d1yhklg|8189
"'""[BK][BK]I was on Chantix when it drove me to suddenly think killing myself was a great idea."|d1yhklg|8190
It felt normal.|d1yhklg|8191
I got out some rope , tied it to the ceiling braces in the basement, stood on a chair and hung myself.|d1yhklg|8192
I remember tunnel vision and everything going dark and then I somehow woke up on the floor.|d1yhklg|8193
The noose was still intact and tied to the beam, and I was confused as hell and terrified.|d1yhklg|8194
"[BK][BK]I immediately stopped taking Chantix."""|d1yhklg|8195
Holding a knife to my chest, my older brother stopping me and saying, 'I have already tried that, trust me it does not make it any better.|d1yicm8|8196
"'""[BK][BK]All I could think is, '""Oh thank god, it is not just me.'"""|d1yicm8|8197
":( [BK][BK]Kinda was in a self loathing spiral there, and figured these feelings were all my fault, and that I was the only one who was broken."""|d1yicm8|8198
I had lunged for the gun involved and was tackled by my neighbor before I could grab it.|d1yj3ym|8199
Not sure if that really counts.|d1yj3ym|8200
"[BK][BK]My thought while on the floor was 'maybe the cops will think I am armed and just shoot me.'"""|d1yj3ym|8201
I am glad I did not.|d1yj3ym|8202
"For the sake of the cop and myself. """|d1yj3ym|8203
"as soon as i cut myself, i basically looked down and immediately was like 'what the fuck did i just do,  mom (who was right there) call 911 i think I am dying'""."|d1yisi8|8204
"and then i just kinda slumped over and the rest is a blur."""|d1yisi8|8205
"My first thought was: 'Wow, and I managed to fuck this up, too.'"""""|d1yj6xi|8206
"'Well, might as well go through this whole gender transition thing.'"""""|d1yiudx|8207
I pointed a 9mm at my head when I was 13 and in that moment I did not feel sad, glad or anything really just Super calm and very zen.|d1yj5vt|8208
It was all going to finally be over (severe emotional abuse and manipulation as well as being the scapegoat of the family) I made sure there was a round in the chamber and then pulled back the hammer and....I stopped..|d1yj5vt|8209
I did not want to stop, I wanted to end my life.|d1yj5vt|8210
But I did stop and now I am here still.|d1yj5vt|8211
I still deal with depression and I still want to kill myself but I just keep going..|d1yj5vt|8212
I play three instruments (drums,guitar and piano.|d1yj5vt|8213
All self taught) and I give piano lessons.|d1yj5vt|8214
Some days are harder than others but I guess my will to live beats a bullet to the head.|d1yj5vt|8215
[BK]|d1yj5vt|8216
"'Never been happier to be a fuckup,'"" I guess?"|d1yiqdo|8217
I tried to OD and a friend found me.|d1yiqdo|8218
"I do not really remember much around it but the flashes of them being so panicked and scared genuinely made me feel horrible about is and all I could think when I woke up more fully was that I was glad I was alive still."""|d1yiqdo|8219
Damn.|d1yjak2|8220
"Then all my friends disappeared because I was 'desperate for attention.'"""|d1yjak2|8221
""""|d1yjak2|8222
I do not really know if this counts as a suicide attempt.|d1yit96|8223
I was five or six and was in first grade or preschool, and I always talked about wanting to die.|d1yit96|8224
Eventually I took out a knife.|d1yit96|8225
In my mind, I was going to put my head on the table and cut my neck like a guillotine.|d1yit96|8226
[BK][BK]I have no recollection what happened next.|d1yit96|8227
"Some time in the next few years, my mom said 'I thought you were really going to do it,'"" and that is pretty much all I remember about it."|d1yit96|8228
[BK][BK]I still think about killing myself every day.|d1yit96|8229
"Sometimes the thought of my parents is the only reason I do not."""|d1yit96|8230
My first thoughts and feelings were of guilt for what I had done (and almost done) to my loved ones who almost certainly would never understand why it happened.|d1yiweu|8231
I woke up with my father (super hardass) looking at me like a crushed child in misery and I realized how much pain I caused and could have caused.|d1yiweu|8232
Welp.|d1yirzf|8233
Can't even do that correctly.|d1yirzf|8234
It makes me very sad that people turn to suicide.|d1yjc5s|8235
It's a permanent solution to a temporary problem.|d1yjc5s|8236
Just came here to say that.|d1yjc5s|8237
Maybe someone who needs it will see this comment.|d1yjc5s|8238
It's so much better to talk to loved ones who can help instead of making them grieve because they did not even know you needed help to begin with.|d1yjc5s|8239
"'Oh yea, I gotta feed my cats'"""""|d1yixh7|8240
Shit...time to try again.|d1yis43|8241
[BK]That was my first thought.|d1yis43|8242
And I did, many times.|d1yis43|8243
"'Why did I wake up?'"""|d1yjtn3|8244
I spent weeks looking up a way to kill myself with the dozens of pills that were prescribed to me at the time.|d1yjtn3|8245
I was fifteen and had just been told I have defective genes, HLA-B27 to be exact, and was due to suffer from every chronic illness my mother had.|d1yjtn3|8246
My youngest brother found my laying in bed after three days and freaked out, apparently my breathing was shallow and my lips were blue so he freaked out and called for an ambulance before my parents even found out.|d1yjtn3|8247
"I love my little brother to death, but to this day, I cannot help but wonder '""What if?'"""""|d1yjtn3|8248
I felt pretty disoriented that morning.|d1yplua|8249

I think.|d1yplua|8251
Don't exactly have the best memory.)|d1yplua|8252
I really missed my fiancé.|d1yplua|8253

I guess I vomited up the pills, and passed out from the alcohol.|d1yjlp1|8257
"[BK][BK]I still want to kill myself, every day, but I have not tried since because I know that my parents (specifically my mom) would never get over it."""|d1yjlp1|8258
I have not attempted suicide but I do feel that I should respond with something because of own experience and the experience of those who have passed through my life:[BK][BK]Suicide is a means to an end.|d1yk0pk|8259
People who consider or try have had their life wrought with pain, depression, or a great loss.|d1yk0pk|8260
Often all they want is for that pain to recede or, looking at it a different way, to finally feel better.|d1yk0pk|8261
Many of you who read this do not know what true depression is like, how crippling it can truly be.|d1yk0pk|8262
Many more, myself included, are largely unaware how debilitating certain conditions or disorders can be for the individual experiencing them.|d1yk0pk|8263
[BK][BK]All of this is just on the surface.|d1yk0pk|8264
[BK][BK]The pain, doubt, fear, loathing, and possible hatred of oneself or one's situation can bring about the darkest moments in a person's life.|d1yk0pk|8265
Suicide is often the way to stop all of that, to not feel like absolute shit any longer.|d1yk0pk|8266
I ask you all that if anyone even mentions suicide *take it seriously*.|d1yk0pk|8267
Do **not** try to talk them out of it, just stay with them and be there.|d1yk0pk|8268
Be a part of their life for the short time it takes for them to realize that maybe there are other ways.|d1yk0pk|8269
[BK][BK]Now I will not lie, you cannot save everyone.|d1yk0pk|8270
If someone wants to commit suicide and is absolutely set on doing so, there is not much you can do.|d1yk0pk|8271
But nor should you walk away.|d1yk0pk|8272
It may not be your responsibility, you may not even feel right doing it, but if you can save a life please do not hesitate.|d1yk0pk|8273
[BK][BK]If you feel like you may be at risk or know someone who is at risk you can join the community over at /r/suicidewatch or get them help from family and professionals with their permission.|d1yk0pk|8274
People have a right to live.|d1yk0pk|8275
We should reinforce that right through our own kindness and our own compassion.|d1yk0pk|8276
Be a hero, you may never get the chance again.|d1yk0pk|8277
Goddamnit.|d1yk03c|8278
That was the first thought.|d1yk03c|8279
There were two different times I had tried to commit suicide and actually came close to dying.|d1yk7vu|8280
[BK][BK]My boyfriend at the time was very emotionally and verbally abusive and I felt so low that I could not bring myself out of it.|d1yk7vu|8281
I felt that nothing I did ever mattered.|d1yk7vu|8282
At this point I had lost all my friends because of him telling me they were no good for me.|d1yk7vu|8283
The first time I had taken roughly 120 OTC pills (generic sleep aids, tylenol, advil combo) and realized 'OH FUCK HOW IS MY SISTER GOING TO BE.|d1yk7vu|8284
"THIS IS WEIRD STOP IT.'"""|d1yk7vu|8285
I ended up just riding out the effects and somehow managed to survive it (Guys, please do not ever do this.)|d1yk7vu|8286
And tried to live for another year until it happened again.|d1yk7vu|8287
For the next year I had thought about what it would do to my younger sister (12 at the time) and that kept me going strong until I went to college.|d1yk7vu|8288
Unfortunately, I became addicted to them and ended up using them as a means for dealing with life.|d1yk7vu|8289
[BK][BK]The second time, I took roughly 100 pills over the course of two days.|d1yk7vu|8290
By this time I was living at college, had a different boyfriend who was as sweet as could be, and removed physically from my family.|d1yk7vu|8291
Being in a new environment with distant conversations about how I was not doing everything right with my family, extremely low self esteem, and not having any friends led me to just binge on sleep aids for two days.|d1yk7vu|8292
I had gotten really upset with my boyfriend for that second night and ended up taking the rest of the bottle I had started the night previously at his dorm room.|d1yk7vu|8293
Ended up blacking out and waking up in a psych ward bed having the vaguest idea of how I got there and why it happened.|d1yk7vu|8294
"I started thinking '""Where the fuck am I?"|d1yk7vu|8295
"Who the fuck... oh fuck I am screwed.'"""|d1yk7vu|8296
I remember being really upset that I had not succeeded, but also relieved because I found out mycollege roommates had been coming every day to see me and make sure I was okay (the hospital was a 20 minute car ride, hour walk.|d1yk7vu|8297
They walked every day to the hospital after classes to see how I was doing.)|d1yk7vu|8298
And I realized I had reasons to live and that I will always have people there for me.|d1yk7vu|8299
[BK][BK]Now I am a full time Barista and going to school, own a car, and looking at apartments with a really cool coworker.|d1yk7vu|8300
"My marks are all extremely high and I have learned how to cope with life and have an amazing support system."""|d1yk7vu|8301
I attempted suicide at age 14.|d1ymyo1|8302
Mother told me twice to kill myself and that if she could go back, she wouldnt have married my dad nor had any kids.|d1ymyo1|8303
So I found a rope in my dads tool shed, went into the woods, and tried to hang myself from a tree.|d1ymyo1|8304
The rope was old, so it snapped from rubbing on the bark.|d1ymyo1|8305
When I hit the ground I heard laughter, which at the time I thought was the gods (I was Graecan) laughing at my failures and denying me my escape; ive since realized that it was my own hatred of myself and my inner demons, and am now a 20 yr old reformed Christian, with a beautiful girlfriend I am planning on proposing to soon.|d1ymyo1|8306
I woke up in a hospital bed at the psych ward after overdosing on sleep medications confused and groggy.|d1ynwwk|8307
My first thought?|d1ynwwk|8308
"[BK][BK]'This place again.'"""|d1ynwwk|8309
[BK][BK]That was 3 years ago when emotionally my life was in a freefall.|d1ynwwk|8310
There was just so much going on and I was only operating with 3 hrs of sleep for going on 5 days straight along with constantly changing medications by my doctor to find the right concotion for me.|d1ynwwk|8311
It just was a bad situation.|d1ynwwk|8312
My wife had left after being hospitalized herself, my parents took my kids, the army was...well...the army, and I was just...alone.|d1ynwwk|8313
[BK][BK]Glad to say things are a lot better now and I know now, no matter how hard things get...or how bad it is...or even how much easier life would be for me if I just did not exist...it gets better.|d1ynwwk|8314
My wife and I reconciled after an affair she was having...kids came back.|d1ynwwk|8315
It turns out my dad was manipulating the both of us...and when we started communicating with each other things changed.|d1ynwwk|8316
"We have been great ever since. """|d1ynwwk|8317
"'Now what?'"""|d1yp253|8318
[BK][BK]I was kinda scared and nervous because I was not even sure if it was sincere or not, and was not sure if I should try again.|d1yp253|8319
I was alone and had nobody around to check on me so I was not hoping/expecting on anyone finding me in time.|d1yp253|8320
But I still felt so surprised that I had finally taken that (what I thought was) last step.|d1yp253|8321
I ended up in a clinic for a few weeks and tried again while there and did actually decide to try again.|d1yp253|8322
That time I was very certain I wanted to end it.|d1yp253|8323
The medication they put me on really impaired my judgement.|d1yp253|8324
After the second try in the clinic I ended up giving up and decided to revisit the idea when I got out and was alone.|d1yp253|8325
That was a few years ago and I am still here.|d1yp253|8326
I still frequently have the thoughts and can get into a deep depression where I map out my steps and plan it out to be sure it looks accidental for insurance purposes.|d1yp253|8327
"It takes a few days and I snap out of it, and have not sincerely tried since. """|d1yp253|8328
It's not something I have talked about much, I think only one person knows how far I got.|d1yqrlr|8329
But for the most part, I decided to abort my attempt.|d1yqrlr|8330
I tried with pills, but about 15 minutes afterwards I could not stop thinking about my family members.|d1yqrlr|8331
I have no problem with death, but I have an older family and I was too worried to be able to go through with it.|d1yqrlr|8332
If my family was younger/healthier I probably would have gone through with it, but while I have no problems taking my own life I will not take anyone with me.|d1yqrlr|8333
My mom has had health issues her whole life, and my grandparents on my father's side are very old (grampie's going to be 100 next month).|d1yqrlr|8334
[BK][BK]So, the first thought I had was of my family I guess.|d1yqrlr|8335
I never went to the hospital or doctor but I felt like crap for the first few days recovering from it.|d1yqrlr|8336
I did not necessarily feel regret, more like just regret at it not being a good time for it.|d1yqrlr|8337
I have had a few episodes since then (it was almost 8 years ago) but have not really tried again.|d1yqrlr|8338
Still depressed but not as severely.|d1yqrlr|8339
Although if I could go peacefully without inflicting too much pain I would probably do so.|d1yqrlr|8340
Long story short I was manipulated for a period of 6 months and raped by one of my marine corps recruiters.|d1yrb2k|8341
He did some pretty sick things and I was afraid to say no and get the cold shoulder (I liked the attention).|d1yrb2k|8342
I did not have time to process what happened until I was already in boot camp and I reported him and had a huge investigation take place.|d1yrb2k|8343
When he was finally court marshaled (taken to court) there were literally PAGES OF GIRLS who said similar things happened to them as well.|d1yrb2k|8344
Nobody understood why I was having so much anxiety and crying all of the time, especially in the marine corps.|d1yrb2k|8345
I tried to kill my self 4 times while in the military.|d1yrb2k|8346
Twice by overdosing on prescription sleeping pills, once I almost managed to walk myself off of a cliff, and the final time I seriously considered to hang myself but did not have anything to do it with.|d1yrb2k|8347
I do not remember what my first thoughts where when I realized that I am still going to live but I am happy that I am and get to spend time with my niece and nephew and my friends and family.|d1yrb2k|8348
My first and only real suicide attempt i tried to overdose on a cocktail mixture of prescription anxiety and pain killers as well as over the counter at age 15.|d1ytbdx|8349
I took A LOT.|d1ytbdx|8350
So i was lying in this field in my neighborhood that cars usually parked in (it was a local Church''s property) and i remember feeling so heavy i could not hold myself up anymore.|d1ytbdx|8351
Two of my friends from the neighborhood stumbled upon me and noticed i was *really bad.|d1ytbdx|8352
* After realizing i had not done enough to kill myself, i was distraught but also really hungry.|d1ytbdx|8353
Hunger is a common side affect with the prescription anxiety reliever that i took.|d1ytbdx|8354
"my friend said to me (and these are the only two sentences i remember from the incident, as i blacked out) 'Anon, you are my friend but if you do not sit up I am gonna have to call an ambulance.'"""|d1ytbdx|8355
"I retorted '""Just let it run it is course!'"""|d1ytbdx|8356
[BK][BK][BK]However like i said, it was not enough to effectively kill me, just black me out and make me feel incredibly heavy as well as extremely painful all over my body.|d1ytbdx|8357
It was so uncomfortable, i was immobile.|d1ytbdx|8358
That day i overdosed but did not die.|d1ytbdx|8359
[BK][BK][BK]If anyone is having feelings of sadness or otherwise, please consider seeing a mental health professional.|d1ytbdx|8360
"I hope everyone the best."""|d1ytbdx|8361
I woke up in the hospital with a cop beside me.|d1ytrj0|8362
I remember thinking his badge was a sticker and trying to remove it.|d1ytrj0|8363
Fascinated by the colors.|d1ytrj0|8364
[BK][BK]I had swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills and drank a bottle of expensive wine.|d1ytrj0|8365
I picked out a very specific bottle for the occasion.|d1ytrj0|8366
My boyfriend at the time came home and found me, thought I was bullshitting until I turned blue and passed out.|d1ytrj0|8367
We're did not have a phone so he went to the apartment downstairs to use the phone.|d1ytrj0|8368
My family was never contacted (I lived in a different province than them).|d1ytrj0|8369
I spent a week in the psych ward so doped up that I did not really think of anything.|d1ytrj0|8370
I wasnt happy at having survived.|d1ytrj0|8371
I did not feel up to trying again.|d1ytrj0|8372
It was a long time if being very numb.|d1ytrj0|8373
[BK][BK]I eventually got myself out of the situation that led to the event, an abusive relationship.|d1ytrj0|8374
Where I discovered he had also been on sites like adult friend finder.|d1ytrj0|8375
And looking up underage porn using my computer.|d1ytrj0|8376
It was a nightmare.|d1ytrj0|8377
And despite being almost a decade ago I definitely struggle with relationships and trust issues and being unable to deal with anyone with the slightest bit of a temper.|d1ytrj0|8378
Part of me wants to warn the men I get involved with about the whole past, but it is something I have never spoken about with anyone I have been romantically involved with since.|d1ytrj0|8379
Actually aside from the asshole who caused me to attempt this and then was responsible for saving me, not a single other person has ever gotten the whole story.|d1ytrj0|8380
And less than 5 people know I ever tried to kill myself.|d1ytrj0|8381
It's a heavy thing I reflect on far too often|d1ytrj0|8382
'am I dead?|d1yuhe5|8383
"'""[BK][BK]This is from my second attempt."|d1yuhe5|8384
My first attempt I put a loaded gun from my stepdads closet in my mouth and my friend called and asked if I wanted to go bowling, made me realize I did not want to die.|d1yuhe5|8385
Or so I thought.|d1yuhe5|8386
On my second attempt I tried to OD.|d1yuhe5|8387
I was 17.|d1yuhe5|8388
I remember waking up, and like many others have said, I was shackled to a hospital bed.|d1yuhe5|8389
I was just confused everything was so bright at first I thought I was in the afterlife.|d1yuhe5|8390
I was so disoriented but eventually came to and saw my parents standing there.|d1yuhe5|8391
All I could do was cry and tell them I was sorry over and over again till I fell back asleep.|d1yuhe5|8392
[BK][BK]If you ever feel so depressed you want to end your life, reach out.|d1yuhe5|8393
As cliche as it sounds just tell someone, get any help you can.|d1yuhe5|8394
It''s not worth putting your family through the pain and torment they will feel, whether you do end your own life or not, they think they have failed you as parents.|d1yuhe5|8395
My dad still believes himself to be a terrible father and he was not, but he blames himself still.|d1yuhe5|8396
[BK][BK]Death is not worth escaping your troubles.|d1yuhe5|8397
As shit as it gets sometimes you have to believe that there is something good around the corner.|d1yuhe5|8398
I recently (22 now) thought about ending my life again about a year ago.|d1yuhe5|8399
I was house sitting for my grandparents and decided to get a bunch of friends together for one last hurrah.|d1yuhe5|8400
They brought more people and I ended up meeting my girlfriend and she is the greatest thing to ever happen to me.|d1yuhe5|8401
"[BK][BK]There is always something good in the world to keep on fighting for."""|d1yuhe5|8402
This will get buried, but I feel obligated to share my story.|d1yxxhp|8403
[BK][BK]I was 14 at the time and a lot was going on.|d1yxxhp|8404
I was a freshman in high school and just broke up with my then gf who I adored.|d1yxxhp|8405
My parents were going through a brutal divorce and were not ashamed of throwing my brothers and I in the middle of it.|d1yxxhp|8406
We were crammed up--all 7 of us-- in a 900 sq ft house.|d1yxxhp|8407
My mother was a crackhead back then.|d1yxxhp|8408
So one day I get a call to go to my gf''s house at like 8-9pm to try to mend things.|d1yxxhp|8409
I get there after walking in the pouring rain and stood at her door as she came out to interrogate me about cheating (which I did not do).|d1yxxhp|8410
She asked if I bought such and such a flower for flower day (which I did for quite a few of my friends) and I say yes and she straight snuffed me.|d1yxxhp|8411
Still got the scar.|d1yxxhp|8412
[BK][BK]So I said fuck it.|d1yxxhp|8413
I went home, grabbed an assload of pills (fuckin Tylenol....|d1yxxhp|8414
I was 14), set a cross beside me on my bed, prayed, and downed the whole bottle.|d1yxxhp|8415
[BK][BK]I woke up the next morning puking my brains out.|d1yxxhp|8416
"My mom came in and saw 'the set-up'"" and instantly realized what I attempted to do and called poison control."|d1yxxhp|8417
"After a bunch of Gatorade and a lot of watching '""EmTV'"" (back when The Marshall Mathers LP came out), I recovered."|d1yxxhp|8418
My mom and I never spoke about it since.|d1yxxhp|8419
Maybe once briefly immediately afterwards.|d1yxxhp|8420
[BK][BK]I just remember waking up and not remembering what I did to make myself so sick.|d1yxxhp|8421
I remembered after a few seconds and did not give it much thought.|d1yxxhp|8422
[BK][BK]That summer (the incident happened in April-May of 2000) was the best summer of my life.|d1yxxhp|8423
I never had so much fun and met so many new people (who are my best friends to this day).|d1yxxhp|8424
"[BK][BK]I remember thinking a few months later, '""Wow."|d1yxxhp|8425
Had that attempt worked, I would not be enjoying myself this much right now.|d1yxxhp|8426
I would be missing all this.|d1yxxhp|8427
"'""[BK][BK]I am now 30 years old, just married my daughter''s mother and making good money."|d1yxxhp|8428
Looking for a house to buy as of now and just enjoy life in general.|d1yxxhp|8429
Everything about it.|d1yxxhp|8430
[BK][BK]EDIT: I just wanted to add some advice to those out there that may contemplate, especially for the teenagers out there... Don''t make any impulse decisions.|d1yxxhp|8431
Life has a funny way of working shit out for everyone.|d1yxxhp|8432
After high school, you wont see or talk to anyone anymore for the most part.|d1yxxhp|8433
Just know that you have the power to make things better.|d1yxxhp|8434
Survive high school and your life really begins.|d1yxxhp|8435
Make the best of it and do not take shit from anyone.|d1yxxhp|8436
"[BK]"""|d1yxxhp|8437
When I was 14 I tried to slit my wrists with a piece of broken glass.|d1yz3q5|8438
I did not want to die, I just did not want to live how I was.|d1yz3q5|8439
I sawed into my wrist with tears and fury and sat there behind my Jr high school in an alley waiting to die.|d1yz3q5|8440
It never happened.|d1yz3q5|8441
I was disappointed but relieved after half an hour.|d1yz3q5|8442
I was bleeding but nothing life threatening apparently.|d1yz3q5|8443
I went home after that, back to the life I hated but with a slightly different outlook because I knew I did not want to die, I could not.|d1yz3q5|8444
My brother and sister needed me.|d1yz3q5|8445
Years later I was the one who had to sit in my brothers apartment with clorox wipes and rags cleaning his belongings so they could be removed after his shotgun suicide.|d1yz3q5|8446
We could not afford to have someone else do it, I hung sheets on the walls so I did not have to look at the mess and put towels on the globs of brain matter and skull fragments that sat in piles on the floor next to me, since the sofa was where he sat and it was dripping with his remnants.|d1yz3q5|8447
As I went around cleaning I saw what I thought were fillings from teeth but turned out to be the pellets from the shotgun that had lodged into the drywall and fallen out coated in white powder.|d1yz3q5|8448
There was not one area that was not covered in matter.|d1yz3q5|8449
And dutifully I sat there for hours cleaning it all up.|d1yz3q5|8450
I am grateful that I lived to be able to save my mom from having to do that.|d1yz3q5|8451
I am so angry at my brother for having done this but I also understand how low you have to feel to get to that point.|d1yz3q5|8452
I no longer have many memories of my brother other than what I had to do for him that day.|d1yz3q5|8453
My psyche could not take it, everything else except for a few limited memories and thoughts has been blocked and muddied by the sheer act of scrubbing bits of skull and brain off his belongings.|d1yz3q5|8454
Sadly I can talk about that with great detail and be so numb that I do not notice the revolted look on peoples faces.|d1yz3q5|8455
The smell is with me always, sometimes it will overpower me and make me sick.|d1yz3q5|8456
And through all of it I still feel as if it was my fault.|d1yz3q5|8457
[BK] I share all of this in hopes that if someone is feeling suicidal just remember that almost every person that has been there and gotten past the feeling or survived an attempt has been glad that they did not do it.|d1yz3q5|8458
Times will get tough.|d1yz3q5|8459
People are assholes.|d1yz3q5|8460
Feelings suck.|d1yz3q5|8461
But its the people that are left behind will never be the same.|d1yz3q5|8462
Once its done, its done.|d1yz3q5|8463
There's no reversal.|d1yz3q5|8464
The only thing that it resolves is the temporary pain that you are in but it creates a permanent pain for those of us that are left to think about it every day.|d1yz3q5|8465
You may not feel it now but you are more important than you think and loved by more people than you realize.|d1yz3q5|8466
My first conscious thoughts were being really freaked out.|d1yzm8u|8467
I drank a liter of vodka, looked up the lethal dose of benadryl, took that, took a bunch of xanax, percoset, and ambien all mixed together.|d1yzm8u|8468
[BK]I heard my name being called from the shadows of my room.|d1yzm8u|8469
That night I kept hearing people call my name from different spots around the room.|d1yzm8u|8470
I had never had an experience like this, and was really scared/freaked out.|d1yzm8u|8471
I was hoping the cocktail of pills and alcohol would kill me and here I am being scared out of my mind.|d1yzm8u|8472
So I laid there, not being able to move for what felt like days, hearing people calling my name and talking to me.|d1yzm8u|8473
Also, I was extremely thirsty because of the bottles of benadryl I took.|d1yzm8u|8474
It was not a pleasant experience.|d1yzm8u|8475
[BK]Since then, I got help, started a medication, and had a lot of therapy/counseling.|d1yzm8u|8476
For the longest time, I thought it was simply normal to think about killing yourself most days.|d1yzm8u|8477
It was something that would float around my head.|d1yzm8u|8478
Since I got help, I have not had these thoughts for quite a while.|d1yzm8u|8479
[BK]If there is anyone who is having a tough time, please feel free to message me!|d1yzm8u|8480
Letting things out is one of the most important things you can do.|d1yzm8u|8481
[BK][BK]Edit: I found out the reason I did not die that night is because I am a super processor for several pain killers and different pills.|d1yzm8u|8482
My first thought was that there was something in the ether trying to keep hold of me, stop me from disappearing into the fog.|d1yslxd|8483
"Then it dissolved into 'shit I cannot even do that properly....'"""""|d1yslxd|8484
'Well.|d1z0e5b|8485
Shit.|d1z0e5b|8486
"'""[BK][BK]I remember getting up in the morning and it just *hurt*."|d1z0e5b|8487
Everything hurt, buy mostly inside.|d1z0e5b|8488
It did not hurt enough, though, so I rubbed every wound with salt.|d1z0e5b|8489
I mean, literally, I had covered myself in them, from the back of my shoulders to the tops of my feet.|d1z0e5b|8490
The room was freezing and I rubbed everything with salt and got dressed.|d1z0e5b|8491
[BK][BK]I remember going down and having breakfast, and it was spring but wet and cold, and absolutely nothing had changed.|d1z0e5b|8492
Nothing.|d1z0e5b|8493
I had not, the world had not.|d1z0e5b|8494
It was like I would never done anything at all.|d1z0e5b|8495
[BK][BK]Putting on my heavy backpack was agony, I remember my shoulders cracked open again.|d1z0e5b|8496
Then I went to school and after that to weekend camp.|d1z0e5b|8497
After camp, on Sunday, my friends forced me to the A&E, and they admitted me to the children''s ward.|d1z0e5b|8498
[BK][BK]I was admitted Sunday evening and by Wednesday noon they would decided I was already getting the care and support I needed.|d1z0e5b|8499
45 minutes of therapy every 14 days and Prozac.|d1z0e5b|8500
[BK][BK]I am very, very bitter about that.|d1z0e5b|8501
It was not enough.|d1z0e5b|8502
I would been doing 45 minutes for years and Prozac for months.|d1z0e5b|8503
[BK][BK]I left.|d1z0e5b|8504
I left everything behind before I turned off age.|d1z0e5b|8505
I was not meant to do that, but I had a safe spot and was in it when my world exploded some months later and I staid.|d1z0e5b|8506
[BK][BK]Almost fifteen years later, I am doing good.|d1z0e5b|8507
Well, I have had one recent bout of depression that has left me on sick leave, but I have not self-harmed and I have not needed hospitalisation.|d1z0e5b|8508
Besides, one bout in 15 years?|d1z0e5b|8509
I can do this.|d1z0e5b|8510
"It''s nothing, compared to where I have been. """|d1z0e5b|8511
Tried driving myself into the wall at high speeds away from public while intoxicated.|d1z106u|8512
Attempt was because of hidden  penis syndrome, coupled with the worst case of balanitis xerotica obliterans my uroligist has ever seen.|d1z106u|8513
[BK][BK]I still  think of other ways to get it done, i mean.|d1z106u|8514
I need surgery  that my urologist cant perform because i have a large pubis mons (pelvis, in short).|d1z106u|8515
[BK][BK]First thought  after i realized i wasnt successful?|d1z106u|8516
I should have got an automatic.|d1z106u|8517
I cant drive a stick shift while drunk.|d1z106u|8518
[BK][BK]Seen my primary care doctor.|d1z106u|8519
Got anti depression medications and while its not as bad as it used to be, I am on a bit of a time limit.|d1z106u|8520
I have until the end of this year to somehow lose enough  weight that my pubis mons fat goes away, or they might have to do a penectomy.|d1z106u|8521
[BK][BK]I refuse to live that life.|d1z106u|8522
So I am scrambling looking for a doctor who will do liposuction  in just that area, then i can get penile reconstruction done... but its not looking promising.[BK][BK]Halp?|d1z106u|8523
Lol.|d1z106u|8524
You can read more about this problem in my past comments.|d1z106u|8525
Apologies now for misspelling or grammar.|d1z106u|8526
Typing on my phone.|d1z106u|8527
Some dazed combination of how?|d1z3jv0|8528
Where am I?|d1z3jv0|8529
What day is it?|d1z3jv0|8530
I tried to overdose.|d1z3jv0|8531
I was a sophomore in high school.|d1z3jv0|8532
Honestly it is a blur why because I cannot imagine now feeling so low.|d1z3jv0|8533
I snuck past my mom while she was napping on the couch and filled a plastic bag with headache pills and then some other type (cannot remember what).|d1z3jv0|8534
I stashed it in my drawer and waited for the moment to come when I knew I was ready.|d1z3jv0|8535
I got in a stupid argument with my mom two days later and sat on the side of the house with a water bottle and started taking them.|d1z3jv0|8536
I think I only got to 45 before my gag reflex kicked in.|d1z3jv0|8537
I could not for the life of me get any more down without gagging.|d1z3jv0|8538
Immediately I panicked thinking I had not taken enough to die and would be a vegetable.|d1z3jv0|8539
I called my best friend and started getting loopy, walking around the neighborhood and dropping pills behind me.|d1z3jv0|8540
My friend convinced me to go back to my house and try to throw up the pills.|d1z3jv0|8541
I instead went to my room and passed out.|d1z3jv0|8542
[BK]I woke up dazed.|d1z3jv0|8543
I remember panicking thinking I had fucked my brain up because I was so loopy.|d1z3jv0|8544
Then I was wondering what wet stuff was on the side of my mouth (throw up).|d1z3jv0|8545
And then wondering why it felt so uncomfortable between my legs (catheter).|d1z3jv0|8546
Then the next few days were a blur until they put me in an ambulance to a mental hospital.|d1z3jv0|8547
[BK][BK]I do remember I could not look my mom in the eye and it made her leave the room sobbing.|d1z3jv0|8548
The only person I would talk to is my sister.|d1z3jv0|8549
It made me realize how fucked all of my relationships with everyone were and what a shitty person I had become.|d1z3jv0|8550
I regret that I made my family suffer through that (and pay thousands for the hospital bills) but I honestly do not think anything else would have woke me up and made me stop being such a shitty person to everyone, including myself.|d1z3jv0|8551
That I am too much of a pussy to go out in terrible pain, so I have to wait until I can rent a gun.|d1ytslp|8552
I was just so thankful that I did not I did not go through with it [BK][BK]About 4 years ago I was 16 and suffered with depression my whole life and after seeing about 5 or 6 different therapist I decided that I could not handle it anymore.|d1z7crz|8553
My mothers boyfriend at the time had an assortment of guns and I decided to break into his gun cabinet and load one.|d1z7crz|8554
[BK] [BK]I sat there with a gun to my head for about 10 minutes before I realized I would be doing more harm to my family rather than solving my issues.|d1z7crz|8555
I knew that at some point that things had to get better.|d1z7crz|8556
My life is great and I had a family that loves and cares about me and I could not deal with the fact that I would be making life for them harder than it should be.|d1z7crz|8557
It felt like such a selfish part on my end.|d1z7crz|8558
[BK] [BK]It took me over two months to confess what I did and I was finally able to get the help I really needed.|d1z7crz|8559
I am truly thankful that I was able to convince myself out of something that I would have regretted.|d1z7crz|8560
Tried with pills.|d1yy9g8|8561
Roomate wokea up extra early for the bathroom and found me just in time.|d1yy9g8|8562
[BK]Doctor said I was a couple hours off dying.|d1yy9g8|8563
[BK][BK]My first thought when I woke up was that of sadness and anger that I failed; even with all my family in the ER.|d1yy9g8|8564
I even harbored some resentment and hate to my roommate for saving me for a few months.|d1yy9g8|8565
This was in September last year.|d1yy9g8|8566
[BK]Now I am doing a lot better and I am really glad that I survived.|d1yy9g8|8567
Life has really started looking up finally.|d1yy9g8|8568

Or turn yourself into a hospital.|d1yy9g8|8570
Life is worth living even through the dark painful moments, it will get better.|d1yy9g8|8571
Not over night, and it will take me effort, but it is worth it.|d1yy9g8|8572
I woke up in the ICU after being in a coma for 5 days.|d1ytsrx|8573
I cried because I had failed.|d1ytsrx|8574

I had to go through a week of being on a psych ward, having panic attacks multiple times a day.|d1z7lvo|8582
Found out I had bi-polar and borderline personality disorders, along with the depression and anxiety.|d1z7lvo|8583
Started seeing a new therapist and psychiatrist because I was forced to.|d1z7lvo|8584
[BK][BK]It's been a year and a half.|d1z7lvo|8585
I still want to kill myself, but I cannot.|d1z7lvo|8586
I cannot do it to my mom, who cries herself to sleep because her daughter is in so much pain.|d1z7lvo|8587
Or my sister, who blames herself because of the way she treated me as a kid.|d1z7lvo|8588
Or my dad, who I saw cry for the first time when I was in the hospital.|d1z7lvo|8589
Or to my friend, who was the one that realized my text was actually a suicide note and called me and the ambulance, and then met me at the hospital and had another friend who lived near me follow the ambulance.|d1z7lvo|8590
She is about to graduate nursing school, I do not want to cause her pain and and then not be able to finish school.|d1z7lvo|8591
[BK][BK]My mom and sister just started going to this support group for family members of people with mental health issues.|d1z7lvo|8592
They are really trying to help me, but I do not even know if I want to help myself.|d1z7lvo|8593
I do not want to be in pain anymore and I do not want to deal with being up and down all the time.|d1z7lvo|8594
I have a crappy life, I have a crappy job, the only good thing in my life is my family and friends.|d1z7lvo|8595
I do not want to let them down, but at the same time I know I will not be able to go on like this forever.|d1z7lvo|8596

We are built to adapt, we are built to change and get better.|d20euft|8601
If anyone gets to the stage that they consider suicide, obviously it is tough, but (cliché warning) it is a long term solution to a short term problem.|d20euft|8602
[BK][BK] Everyone should also know that no matter what there are people who think they matter, some who loves them.|d20euft|8603
[BK][BK]Depression, particularly at the advanced stage that brings on suicidal thoughts destroys everything inside us, takes our self esteem and makes us think we are worthless and no-one loves us.|d20euft|8604
This is not, nor will it ever be true.|d20euft|8605
People will support you, people will have your back and at the end of the day,no matter what, help is always just a text, call, message or pm away.|d20euft|8606
[BK][BK]All the love to my brothers and sisters going through tough times right now.|d20euft|8607

Fucked it up 2 times.|d20nkm8|8611
Second time I was 19.|d20nkm8|8612
Just lost my fun, had no real hobbies beside handball & school was college was so easy that it felt like nothing to achieve the grades.|d20nkm8|8613
Some late night I didnt go to sleep but took the car & went like 190km/h on highway.|d20nkm8|8614
Turned the sWheel & thats where my memories stopped.|d20nkm8|8615
Later in hospital they told me that they somehow managed to get me out of that wreck with like no injuries (only broken arm).|d20nkm8|8616
"I managed to state that 1 as 'too less sleeping'""."|d20nkm8|8617
[BK][BK]My 1st try was with 16.|d20nkm8|8618
Nearly dropped out of school cause I wasnt interested in anything there.|d20nkm8|8619
Too easy, doc''s tested me & said im one of the top 0.09% most intelligent people tested by this test.|d20nkm8|8620
Layd back & nothing was worth any effort.|d20nkm8|8621
One morning on my way to school I stopped by some bridge which is like 8m high (some over a street).|d20nkm8|8622
It took me like 10-20 minutes before I took a seat on the edge.|d20nkm8|8623
Some seconds later I tried to push myself away while feeling something holding me from the back.|d20nkm8|8624
Some stranger watched me all the time & kept me on this bridge.|d20nkm8|8625
"She promised me that she will never tell anyone as long as I dont try it again..."""|d20nkm8|8626
"'Wow, I am such a failure piece of shit that I cannot even kill myself correctly'""."|d1y7t5w|8627
I had been a self injurer for years, punishing myself for not living up to my own expectations.|d1y7t5w|8628
This particular night I went out drinking with my roommates during college.|d1y7t5w|8629
We got back to the house and I was so steaming mad at myself I decided I deserved to die during the car ride home.|d1y7t5w|8630
Went in my room, got my box cutter and started slashing myself.|d1y7t5w|8631
I never cut deep enough to hit an artery so I gave up.|d1y7t5w|8632
That was lowest I have ever felt in my life.|d1y7t5w|8633
[BK][BK]I hope this does not get buried because self injury is horribly misunderstood.|d1y7t5w|8634
Many think its a cry for attention and I feel sometimes people use it as such.|d1y7t5w|8635
In reality you could care less about what others were thinking.|d1y7t5w|8636
You hate yourself so much that you feel the need to be punished.|d1y7t5w|8637
You punish yourself and feel a feeling of satisfaction that you are setting things right and you completely deserve it.|d1y7t5w|8638
Down the road you get hooked on the feeling of the pain and its almost like drug.|d1y7t5w|8639
[BK][BK][BK][BK]Edit: I am kinda shocked redditors are viewing the story of my suicide attempt as controversial.|d1y7t5w|8640
I am truly at a loss for words.|d1y7t5w|8641
I mean people are sharing extremely intimate secrets of their lives here.|d1y7t5w|8642
To downvote anyone other than someone trying to make a joke here is just brutal.|d1y7t5w|8643
[BK][BK]I commend the courage of others who have shared their stories.|d1y7t5w|8644
I was shivering when typing my because I had to essentially relive it again in all its shame.|d1y7t5w|8645
"Probably not unlike the rest of you."""|d1y7t5w|8646
I thankfully never completed my suicide attempt.|d1y7tao|8647
[BK][BK] I sat on my couch with a knife to my wrist and had even written a note, but then I just could not go through with it.|d1y7tao|8648
[BK]I do not remember much from right afterwards I think I just fell asleep and spend the next day on my couch in a complete stupor.|d1y7tao|8649
[BK][BK]I had been suicidal for awhile before this happened, I spend most days planning how best to do it in the back of my mind, if I could get my hands on a gun or if I should cut myself.|d1y7tao|8650
I just wanted it to be fast.|d1y7tao|8651
[BK][BK]My actual attempt kinda came out of the blue, there was nothing in particular that triggered it right then, one evening I just felt that I had had enough and could not take it anymore.|d1y7tao|8652
I was in a pretty deep depression at the time and had recently had to drop out of my education because of it.|d1y7tao|8653
[BK][BK]This happened in beginning of 2011 and the rest of that year is just one big blur to me now.|d1y7tao|8654
It was not untill around the end of the year when some of my friends came to visit and saw my apartment piled up with old pizza boxes and other trash, they gave me a push to seek some help and regain some control over my life.|d1y7tao|8655
[BK][BK]I spend 2012 slowly getting better, I even got back to my education and finished the next year.|d1y7tao|8656
I will probably have to take some meds for the rest of my life, but that is a small price to pay, to avoid falling into a hole like that ever again.|d1y7tao|8657
the last time I attempted suicide was in 2013.|d1zc6e8|8658
I OD'd on celexa, trazodone and topomax.|d1zc6e8|8659
I woke up in the ambulance with blood ALL OVER ME, shivering and crying.|d1zc6e8|8660
The emergency worker told me they found me in the campus parking lot passed out.|d1zc6e8|8661
I did not remember calling 911 at all, I only remembered taking the pills and laying in bed.|d1zc6e8|8662
At that time I still was not sure if I was going to make it, because I was going in and out of consciousness.|d1zc6e8|8663
[BK][BK]After a few hours in the ER and realizing that I was going survive, the first thing I thought of was how upset my Mom was going to be, and how I was going to explain this to her.|d1zc6e8|8664
This had been my third suicide attempt in two months.|d1zc6e8|8665
I was so angry at myself for wanting to die but not being able to go through with it.|d1zc6e8|8666
[BK][BK]Now a few years later I deeply regret doing those things to myself, and hurting my family so much.|d1zc6e8|8667
My brother and sister have a rough relationship with me.|d1zc6e8|8668
I love my family, and I am learning to love myself every day <3|d1zc6e8|8669

I requested to speak with my friend Brittany, and eventually the anger left me.|d1z2i46|8682
The next few days I felt numb and was tired of being in the hospital.|d1z2i46|8683

When I was fourteen, I made a mistake I thought made me an irredeemable person and the only way to allow the people around me to live a normal life was to kill myself.|d1z5ldc|8691
I decided to go through with it when I was sitting in my dad's office.|d1z5ldc|8692
There was nothing around, so I stabbed myself in the wrists with a pencil, thinking it would pierce the vein and allow me to bleed out.|d1z5ldc|8693
One thing that stood out to me is that it did not hurt at all.|d1z5ldc|8694
Now if I even try to prick my wrist with a blunt pen it hurts, but when I had totally lost all my will to live, it did not at all.|d1z5ldc|8695
Once I realized I was unsuccessful, I began to feel even more useless since I could not even kill myself properly.|d1z5ldc|8696
This would lead to two years of crippling depression in which I came close to killing myself two other times.|d1z5ldc|8697
Most of the time it was sadness followed by relief.|d1z0n0l|8698
Sad that I needed to keep on going through the hell but also relief over it was not over.|d1z0n0l|8699
I tried a few times.|d1z0n0l|8700
I also got angry at myself for being a pussy and not do it properly.|d1z0n0l|8701

I had taken quite a bit of trazodone, but not as drastically as most pill stories I read.|d1z7tge|8730

I do not even think my intention was to die, I just did not want to be conscious anymore.|d1z7tge|8732

I do not know what it was that tipped my mom off to call an ambulance, but afaik to this day she does not know that that time was different.|d1z7tge|8735

I had no recollection of the previous 12 hours.|d1y9qt5|8760
Apparently I was in a hotel room with vomit and blood around me|d1y9qt5|8761
Something along the lines of 'What?|d1y21oz|8762
How?|d1y21oz|8763
"'""[BK][BK]I had hung myself and right after I had drifted off I suddenly took a quick breathe and I was wide awake again."|d1y21oz|8764
I realized I had grabbed the rope and pulled myself up a little bit to allow me to take one small breathe.|d1y21oz|8765
I then untied the rope and cried for a while before going to the hospital.|d1y21oz|8766
[BK][BK]I still think about it a lot, because I felt like I had no strength, and could not imagine how I had managed enough to pull myself up, outside of consciousness nonetheless.|d1y21oz|8767

It was kind of shocking for this comment to blow up the way it did.|d1y1z49|8796
As for the restraints I was not clear.|d1y1z49|8797
They were not actually handcuffs but more of a leather strap that tied my feet and wrists down to the bed.|d1y1z49|8798

Let the realization that I was a failure even in trying to kill myself wash over me.|d1y0wzx|8805
[BK][BK]That was a long time ago and I could not be happier I failed.|d1y0wzx|8806
The scars do cause me embarrassment, though.|d1y0wzx|8807
I tried to commit suicide via gunshot to the head when I had went through a horrible break up(she had a son I came to love) and lost my job all in the same day.|d1y7kq5|8808

I actually felt like more of a failure at that point, when I noticed a picture of me and my ex gf's son at my desk.|d1y7kq5|8810
I realized I made that kids life different over the past three years and he changed me for the better.|d1y7kq5|8811

Relief.|d1ybgwu|8818
Plain and simple, relief.|d1ybgwu|8819
[BK][BK]I hate talking about this.|d1ybgwu|8820
It was so long ago, but it still pains me at times.|d1ybgwu|8821
I have never 100% moved on from those darkest of days, and it is a constant battle keeping the negative thoughts restrained and at bay.|d1ybgwu|8822
But, here goes... [BK][BK]In my teens, I had a few failed suicide attempts.|d1ybgwu|8823
The first few, I was not really dedicated to the cause.|d1ybgwu|8824
It was a true cry for help, and I knew it.|d1ybgwu|8825
I felt alone and abandoned even though I had little reason to.|d1ybgwu|8826
[BK][BK]Throughout my childhood I looked up to my dad.|d1ybgwu|8827
He was a hero of sorts.|d1ybgwu|8828
Now that I am in my 30''s, he is even more of a hero.|d1ybgwu|8829
The hardship he is overcome for the betterment of us kids and mum is astonishing.|d1ybgwu|8830
In my teens, it became apparent that my father and I had very different interests.|d1ybgwu|8831
[BK][BK]He was Rugby mad.|d1ybgwu|8832
I moved from rugby to soccer, then to golf  then dumped sports entirely to chase my passion of cars.|d1ybgwu|8833
Well, being a troublesome street racer shit bag more like.|d1ybgwu|8834
I was a tech geek.|d1ybgwu|8835
He had no interest in it.|d1ybgwu|8836
I was becoming a bit of a game geek, he had no interest in any of that.|d1ybgwu|8837
[BK][BK]Now that is probably not that big a deal to most.|d1ybgwu|8838
And I doubt it would have for me.|d1ybgwu|8839
He is a good guy, and a difference in interests would not have been allowed to tarnish a father son bond.|d1ybgwu|8840
I was the eldest son.|d1ybgwu|8841
So I was always a wee bit jealous thinking my younger brothers had it better than me.|d1ybgwu|8842
Further to that, I was the victim of ruthless small town bullying.|d1ybgwu|8843
[BK][BK]From when I first started primary school until after I had left high-school.|d1ybgwu|8844
The bullying never ended.|d1ybgwu|8845
I felt let down and abused by my peers.|d1ybgwu|8846
Through primary and then onto high-school,  I always had a small set of friends.|d1ybgwu|8847
However, primary friends went to boarding school when I went to high school.|d1ybgwu|8848
I had to start fresh.|d1ybgwu|8849
Eventually when I left high-school early because I was failing dismally because of the bullying, I did not really have friends outside of school.|d1ybgwu|8850
Again,  I was making new ones.|d1ybgwu|8851
This is where I feel in with the bad crowd.|d1ybgwu|8852
Really bad crowd.|d1ybgwu|8853
I was desperate to be accepted so I went along with their bullshit.|d1ybgwu|8854
Even though deep down I knew I was being used as I had money because I worked full time, and had a car meaning transport into the surrounding cities.|d1ybgwu|8855
It was a shitty time, and it further drove a wedge between myself, and the majority of the towns citizens around my age and a little older.|d1ybgwu|8856
It sucked.|d1ybgwu|8857
[BK][BK]Anyway, one night some shit went down.|d1ybgwu|8858
I will not say what, because it was not good.|d1ybgwu|8859
Anyway, while I did not participate directly, I stood by and allowed it to happen.|d1ybgwu|8860
I wanted to stop it so bad,  but I did not.|d1ybgwu|8861
Fuck I regret it to this day.|d1ybgwu|8862
Eventually, we all got found out.|d1ybgwu|8863
Police interviews and all that shit.|d1ybgwu|8864
Got tasked to community service.|d1ybgwu|8865
As word went around town, the bullies that were a bit older than me, came down hard.|d1ybgwu|8866
I would get jumped by groups of them when walking home at night.|d1ybgwu|8867
Lost teeth to their fists.|d1ybgwu|8868
Some of my assailants were cousins.|d1ybgwu|8869
Fuck that hurt even more.|d1ybgwu|8870
Family members hating me enough to do that.|d1ybgwu|8871
I think the brother next down from me knew what was going on.|d1ybgwu|8872
We had always fought.|d1ybgwu|8873
Viciously at times.|d1ybgwu|8874
But during this period, he was just different.|d1ybgwu|8875
Noticeably so.|d1ybgwu|8876
Like he was trying to show love and be an awesome little brother, without making it obvious to anyone else.|d1ybgwu|8877
[BK][BK]Aside from him, I made sure no one knew how bad my life had become.|d1ybgwu|8878
I did not want to let my parents down thinking they had raised such a fucking loser.|d1ybgwu|8879
I would bottle it all up.|d1ybgwu|8880
From time to time it had all explode out violently.|d1ybgwu|8881
At school, then at pubs later in life.|d1ybgwu|8882
The switch would finally get flicked and I would explode.|d1ybgwu|8883
I would wind up getting hurt, but I always dealt some serious damage in the process.|d1ybgwu|8884
Was never proud of it.|d1ybgwu|8885
It was embarrassing.|d1ybgwu|8886
And for some of my bullies it added to the fun.|d1ybgwu|8887
The game became trying to set me off.|d1ybgwu|8888
How much prodding would it take until that looney cunt blows his top.|d1ybgwu|8889
Haha fun times right?|d1ybgwu|8890
[BK][BK]Anyway,  I am waffling on.|d1ybgwu|8891
I am not putting events together in a correct order etc.|d1ybgwu|8892
I guess the bonus of hitting this thread so late is its unlikely many will ever read this jumble of words.|d1ybgwu|8893
[BK][BK]First couple times, I did a shit job.|d1ybgwu|8894
Didn''t take enough pills.|d1ybgwu|8895
Didn''t tie the noose right.|d1ybgwu|8896
Survived the drive off the cliff.|d1ybgwu|8897
Until I came to my final attempt at ending my life.|d1ybgwu|8898
I was older now.|d1ybgwu|8899
Probably 18.|d1ybgwu|8900
I had made the concious decision that this is the day I leave this world, and no cunt is going to get in the way.|d1ybgwu|8901
The plan was to overdose, and that is exactly what I did.|d1ybgwu|8902
I took a ton of pills late one evening, and then walked around behind the wood shed at home, sat myself under a big Norfolk pine and let my mind begin to close down.|d1ybgwu|8903
I did not give a fuck.|d1ybgwu|8904
I did not want to leave any lasting legacy.|d1ybgwu|8905
I just wanted to check out.|d1ybgwu|8906
No fucking note.|d1ybgwu|8907
No bullshit.|d1ybgwu|8908
No final texts desperate to be talked out of it.|d1ybgwu|8909
Nope, fuck this world and fuck every bastard in it.|d1ybgwu|8910
[BK][BK]The final moments of consciousness I recall the porch light coming on.|d1ybgwu|8911
Dad coming outside and heading for my sleep out.|d1ybgwu|8912
I did not really care that he would find pill bottles.|d1ybgwu|8913
I was on my way out.|d1ybgwu|8914
(God what an asshole I was.|d1ybgwu|8915
I cannot believe at the time I could not even muster some emotion for what I was about to put my family through.|d1ybgwu|8916
I hate myself some times).|d1ybgwu|8917
Everything went black momentarily.|d1ybgwu|8918
I was checking out.|d1ybgwu|8919
Barely popping in and out of consciousness.|d1ybgwu|8920
I remember coming too for a bit.|d1ybgwu|8921
Dad calling out to mum.|d1ybgwu|8922
Sounding panicked.|d1ybgwu|8923
Blackness again.|d1ybgwu|8924
Mum and dad calling my name.|d1ybgwu|8925
Clearly emotional and panicked.|d1ybgwu|8926
Then, the moment that changed my life.|d1ybgwu|8927
Open my eyes for a moment.|d1ybgwu|8928
And dad comes clamoring through the shubs and grabs me.|d1ybgwu|8929
Tears rolling down his face.|d1ybgwu|8930
Can''t even remember what he said.|d1ybgwu|8931
I was fucked.|d1ybgwu|8932
"Something totally kiwi though along the lines of 'you fucking idiot, what have you done to yourself... come on mate'""."|d1ybgwu|8933
[BK][BK]That was the last thing I remembered until waking in the hospital.|d1ybgwu|8934
Mum and Dad right there by my side.|d1ybgwu|8935
I never shook that look on dad''s face.|d1ybgwu|8936
The emotion on it.|d1ybgwu|8937
That moment when I realised that he really did give a fuck about me.|d1ybgwu|8938
Loved me, just like all his sons.|d1ybgwu|8939
And that sinking sensation thinking how bloody close I came to realising it all too late.|d1ybgwu|8940
[BK][BK]I love my family.|d1ybgwu|8941
I know they all love me.|d1ybgwu|8942
While life can be a real struggle for me at times financially etc, I know I came through the pits of despair and came through the other side.|d1ybgwu|8943
Despite ALL of that, depression sneaks up on my a lot.|d1ybgwu|8944
I am in my 30''s now, and at times I still have to fight back the urges to just let the darkness take over, and finally check out.|d1ybgwu|8945
The main thing that prevents it is knowing how much pain I will put my family and girlfriend though if I did it.|d1ybgwu|8946
I do not want to find out there is an afterlife and have to live in the knowledge I destroyed the hearts of so many.|d1ybgwu|8947
[BK][BK][BK]Anyway, there is my story.|d1ybgwu|8948
I do not know why I told it on Reddit of all places.|d1ybgwu|8949
Just felt like it was time to get it all off my chest.|d1ybgwu|8950
I am so emotional now.|d1ybgwu|8951
Sad in a way.|d1ybgwu|8952
Feeling like a failure of sorts.|d1ybgwu|8953
But, also a little relieved.|d1ybgwu|8954
And proud looking back, and seeing how far I have come.|d1ybgwu|8955
[BK][BK]Anyway  thanks reddit for allowing me the space to let that all out.|d1ybgwu|8956
I think I will look for somewhere on Reddit to talk about this stuff more regularly.|d1ybgwu|8957
I think it might be beneficial.|d1ybgwu|8958
[BK][BK]Edit: an amazing redditor sent me a deep and heartfelt pm that has me feeling a bit better.|d1ybgwu|8959
Talking about such things brings me back to a darker lonely place I try to avoid wherever possible.|d1ybgwu|8960
You, the awesome people of Reddit, make it much easier for myself and others to open up about such thoughts and emotions, thanks to your genuinely caring responses.|d1ybgwu|8961
So, thanks guys.|d1ybgwu|8962

.|d1y284t|8976
now I have to go to fucking work.|d1y284t|8977
Luckily my only attempt, but I did continue to cut myself for about 7 more years.|d1y284t|8978
But, I have managed to make it out from drowning in my own head without drugs or real therapy.|d1y284t|8979
Sometimes, you just need to survive .|d1y284t|8980
.|d1y284t|8981
.|d1y284t|8982
I realized that no one gave a shit if I lived or died as I spent almost three days out of it, puking my guts up only managing to stay alive because I ended up passing out on my side and did not drown in vomit.|d1y4tk4|8983
No one ever checked in on me, only complained about the smell when I came out of my room to go to the hospital.|d1y4tk4|8984
I was told to stop being a whiny bitch about everything when I told her what I did and to knock it off.|d1y4tk4|8985
She then left to go visit her pedophile husband in jail because that is what you do when your grandkid tries to kill themselves.|d1y4tk4|8986
Oh man...|d1y3uq0|8987
I was very suicidal and had a few near death overdoses.|d1y3uq0|8988
One I woke up and pulled my iv's out and walked off, I got pretty far and got arrested and sent to psych.|d1y3uq0|8989
That was memorable because I got down the street.|d1y3uq0|8990
[BK][BK]One was very surreal.|d1y3uq0|8991
I woke up in hospital and the strangest feeling come over me.|d1y3uq0|8992
I slowly came back online starting with hearing and sight, then I could move my feet and hands.|d1y3uq0|8993
I was so shocked to be alive, not in a bad way at all.|d1y3uq0|8994
Sort of dumbfounded but relieved because I had insane night terrors.|d1y3uq0|8995
You're memory of events can trick you, especially with drugs, but in the darkness I felt something pushing me, trying to drown me and I could not breath but I was fighting it and did not have strength.|d1y3uq0|8996
Like a dream when you cannot clench your fist.|d1y3uq0|8997
I felt myself dying in the realest way, i was in the complete darkness, just 'okay, heart, beat, breath, you can do it, beat again and breath and you you will be fine' for what felt like days.|d1y3uq0|8998
It felt like 50 years, I swear on my life.|d1y3uq0|8999
I knew I was surrounded by lots of people in my house at one point.|d1y3uq0|9000
I was awake and talking to a doctor for half an hour before I touched my head and realized I had stitches all over and I had blood all over me.|d1y3uq0|9001
They'd cleaned it off my head and chest but sort of smeared it all over, I saw myself in the mirror and it was like a horror movie.|d1y3uq0|9002
Just in the sense it was so shocking and did not feel real and the stitches just looked like make up.|d1y3uq0|9003
[BK][BK]It still does not feel real and I do not have too many people to talk about it with, without sounding like a kook.|d1y3uq0|9004
I will open up more about my life one day but it is too soon and it got so dark for me for a little bit.|d1y3uq0|9005
[BK][BK]I did not start learning to love myself until the very moment I lay dying, what happened that day and in the months following was nothing short of life changing for me.|d1y3uq0|9006
It made me a believer in some kind of love energy that most people seem oblivious to, I feel enlightened in a way.|d1y3uq0|9007
I rearranged my priorities and I have been healthy and good to people around me for the last two years.|d1y3uq0|9008
[BK][BK]I am really happy with myself but I have a lot of issues, you would never guess though, I am doing really well and look great.|d1y3uq0|9009
I feel a lot more alienated from society, just in that I felt something and feel I know a secret I cannot share.|d1y3uq0|9010
I want to help other people but you cannot make them feel.|d1y3uq0|9011
Sometimes I feel like some sort of little godling and wonder how I have been so lucky my whole life, skirting death.|d1y3uq0|9012
I think when you grow up surrounded by tragedy, it is easier to find beauty in life, so I cannot say this is due to my experience but a reflection on my life when I got sober.|d1y3uq0|9013
[BK][BK]Ive got tears in my eyes.|d1y3uq0|9014
Anyone can do it.|d1y3uq0|9015
Anyone can change their life around and you do not need to die!|d1y3uq0|9016
You will find love or you will find a way and I promise, if you want to die young you can change your attitude/behavior and start to feel younger everyday!|d1y3uq0|9017
You'll hope to die younger than you are!|d1y3uq0|9018
Life can be meaningless but it doesnt mean it is not beautiful and you are not a tiny piece of this energy we all share.|d1y3uq0|9019
Most of us will die screaming, no matter how nice we are on this earth, is the reality.|d1y3uq0|9020
You do not get to choose your death, I have probably been saved for a much slower/violent one, but I will sure as fuck use newfound control over my life to choose to smile, maybe if I do not even feel like it, and try to be good while I can.|d1y3uq0|9021
This thing on earth is too short to be a shitty example.|d1y3uq0|9022
[BK][BK]I have lost a lot of friends to this darkness and I wish they knew that the darker it got, the higher the potential.|d1y3uq0|9023
You do not see the good without the bad, when you have seen the worst you you will be able to find happiness very easily in the things and people around you if you can learn to bend your willpower and change your ways.|d1y3uq0|9024
If you try with all your heart, you will come out a well rounded person.|d1y3uq0|9025
You will be told this by people close to you, which feels so relieving.|d1y3uq0|9026
When you take care of yourself, people take care of you.|d1y3uq0|9027
When you put good energy out and trust in yourself and your decisions good things will just flow into your life.|d1y3uq0|9028
[BK][BK]I elaborated on the question, I wanted to tell a bit of my story in case someone out there is looking for some hope.|d1y3uq0|9029
A lot of the responses were pretty negative and these people are still afraid, we are all better than that.|d1y3uq0|9030
I do not think I had thoughts in words, I was just really sick and in a lot of pain.|d1xziot|9031
I was dehydrated too, so I had to get fluids from an IV through my hand.|d1xziot|9032
I had blankets piled up on me and I was still freezing.|d1xziot|9033
My hand was super cold too, I have bad veins, but I could not see them at all.|d1xziot|9034
It was weird.|d1xziot|9035
I also yelled at a nurse who tried getting me up to take a urine sample.|d1xziot|9036
It really was not the thought after but during dying.|d1y55ba|9037
It's terrifying being on the precipice of death,  - 10 out of 10 would not do it again.|d1y55ba|9038
"'Fuck I am still here'"" [BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]I almost do not want to share this because I do not know if it is helpful for people who are going through it right now."|d1y1o97|9039
But I have seen and read so many accounts of people who changed their mind when it seemed to be too late, or realised all their problems were insignificant once they were almost dead.|d1y1o97|9040
But that did not happen to me.|d1y1o97|9041
"[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]When I started vomiting blood and bile, all I could think was '""I really hope I am not throwing up the pills right now'""."|d1y1o97|9042
I also felt disgusting and ashamed, but I did not want to live and I did not change my mind.|d1y1o97|9043
When I woke up I was covered in blood (some from vomit, but a lot from my arms and legs which I would absolutely shredded with a blade.)|d1y1o97|9044
there was sick all over the floor and in my hair, and my clothes and face were wet with tears.|d1y1o97|9045
I was a mess, and I felt like I would fucked up my life in every possible way, and I have never felt so disappointed or disgusted with myself than when I properly realised it had not worked.|d1y1o97|9046
[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]And honestly I would have loved that to be a wake up call or the moment I changed, but it was not.|d1y1o97|9047
I felt that same disgust for some years afterwards.|d1y1o97|9048
To me, that was confirmation that I would never be happy, and that I would never settle into life in the way that everyone else seemed to.|d1y1o97|9049
I just accepted that I would never be happy, and that I would never stop wanting to die.|d1y1o97|9050
I cannot really explain why I thought this.|d1y1o97|9051
I just believed there was something inherently wrong with me, an illness, or something about who I am as a person, which meant I would always feel suicidal.|d1y1o97|9052
[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]If I could go back and meet this younger version of myself, I would give her such a huge hug.|d1y1o97|9053
But I do not really know what I would tell her.|d1y1o97|9054
I do not know what it was that made everything finally click.|d1y1o97|9055
I do not know what is happening in my brain now that was not happening then.|d1y1o97|9056
I think I just finally realised that it is down to me.|d1y1o97|9057
Of course you cannot think your way out of depression, but you can learn how to cope with it better, and eventually how to combat it.|d1y1o97|9058
Over time I completely changed my attitude.|d1y1o97|9059
Depression still plagued me, it was still there in my head, but I found ways to make it quieter, and ways to make it hurt less.|d1y1o97|9060
Very, very, slowly, I even found ways to be happy.|d1y1o97|9061
I realised that my happiness was my responsibility, and I could not just sit there waiting for depression to leave me.|d1y1o97|9062
And I can honestly say now that I am a very happy person, I enjoy life, and even during stressful times I am ok and I can dea with it while still being happy in myself.|d1y1o97|9063
It took a long time to get here but it was the most worthwhile thing I ever worked on.|d1y1o97|9064
Being happy is pretty much the best thing you you will ever be.|d1y1o97|9065
"[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]There''s a quote I found during that time which I really like: '""no matter how far from the truth we are led by histrionics and lies, the truly, objectively beautiful remains untainted.'"""|d1y1o97|9066
I thought about that a lot and I still do.|d1y1o97|9067
No matter how bad things get, no matter what awful things my brain throws at me, there is objective beauty in this world which can never be taken away.|d1y1o97|9068
I worked really hard to see it everywhere.|d1y1o97|9069
Flowers, the moon, my cat, my mum, strawberries, anything at all.|d1y1o97|9070
I just reminded myself that to me, these things will always be beautiful, and my depression could not stop that.|d1y1o97|9071
Eventually it was less hard work to find beautiful things.|d1y1o97|9072
I saw them everywhere, and I still do.|d1y1o97|9073
"[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]Another is from Oscar Wilde '""the only reason for a useless thing is that one admires it intensely."|d1y1o97|9074
"All art is quite useless.'"""|d1y1o97|9075
When I first discovered that quote I believed myself to be useless.|d1y1o97|9076
This quote made me smile.|d1y1o97|9077
Everything here is useless really.|d1y1o97|9078
The only point is to love things and sometimes to let them love you.|d1y1o97|9079
[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]I am happy to be alive.|d1y1o97|9080
Im happy to be here with all these beautiful things and people.|d1y1o97|9081
If anyone out there is having a difficult time with suicidal thoughts, or depression, please know that it can get better.|d1y1o97|9082
Please know that I love you very much and you are a beautiful thing that I am proud to share a planet with.|d1y1o97|9083
[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]**EDIT:** I really did not expect such a huge response to this.|d1y1o97|9084
I am honestly overwhelmed by it and I do not know what to say.|d1y1o97|9085
To know that a really awful time in my life has ended up helping people a little bit is really humbling.|d1y1o97|9086
Those years of my life were pretty much wasted, but now it feels like they were worth something.|d1y1o97|9087
Thank you so much to the people who shared your stories with me.|d1y1o97|9088
I will be responding to everyone personally because this has all affected me a lot.|d1y1o97|9089
You really are all amazing, and it made me cry to see so much love being shared in the comments.|d1y1o97|9090
It''s so lovely that such a negative premise has created so much positivity.|d1y1o97|9091

I used to have a horrible cocaine and alcohol addiction.|d1y9xjy|9100
Add into that an extremely emotionally abusive gf at the time and it was a true recipe for disaster.|d1y9xjy|9101
I lived in Hudson County NJ at the time, which is right across the river from NYC(I lived half way up between the Lincoln tunnel and GWB).|d1y9xjy|9102
We would get high and drunk, fight, and then I would wander around all night.|d1y9xjy|9103
[BK][BK]I made the walk up to the GWB several times but always turned back.|d1y9xjy|9104
Well after one particularly bad marathon binge and subsequent fight I decided this was it.|d1y9xjy|9105
I grabbed the bottle of Jack, stopped by my dealer for one last gram, and walked upto the bridge.|d1y9xjy|9106
The whole time I am sniffing, drinking and cryingncuz all I can hear is her telling me how pathetic I am and how she never loved me.|d1y9xjy|9107
[BK][BK]I start walking across the bridge, and how I was not stopped idk(I walked past some cops on the footpath and I know I looked like k did not have all my with about me).|d1y9xjy|9108
So as I am walking across I stop at the spot where I was going to jump.|d1y9xjy|9109
I take one last blast and as I am leaning on the rail crying my eyes out I see someone out of my peripherals.|d1y9xjy|9110
It was someone on an early morning jog.|d1y9xjy|9111
They''re coming up on me and all I hear is 'Don''t do it man.|d1y9xjy|9112
"It''s not worth it.'"""|d1y9xjy|9113
[BK][BK]The person did not even break stride.|d1y9xjy|9114
Didn''t stop to talk.|d1y9xjy|9115
Didn''t offer anything else besides those passing words.|d1y9xjy|9116
And that is when it hit me.|d1y9xjy|9117
It''s not worth it.|d1y9xjy|9118
If I could just get my shit show of a life together it would not be worth it.|d1y9xjy|9119
[BK][BK]I went home and passed out due to all the alcohol and exhaustion.|d1y9xjy|9120
I woke up and made major changes in my life.|d1y9xjy|9121
That still ended up being the last gram of coke I ever bought.|d1y9xjy|9122
I broke up with my gf.|d1y9xjy|9123

I put my earbuds in, put on some soothing music, and tied a plastic grocery bag around my head with some rubber bands.|d1y4v13|9148
I was so out of it that I did not notice the bag had a tear in it.|d1y4v13|9149
I ended up falling asleep from a fair bit of Xanax I had taken, but then I woke up the next day feeling even worse.|d1y4v13|9150
I sat around the house for the rest of that day feeling like the biggest failure.|d1y4v13|9151
How could I explain to my parent on what happened (I was only 8).|d1y2oho|9152
From then on I have promised myself not to do it again... Not for me, but for the ones who loves me.|d1y2oho|9153
I struggle with it once in a while.|d1y2oho|9154

I remember laughing as I did it because I did not have to worry about any kind of bloodborne diseases or infections because I would be dead soon anyway.|d1y56mj|9162
It was not sharp enough to do much real damage, but I did not really get that so I went and found a bush to lay under to wait.|d1y56mj|9163

[BK][BK]The first thing that always comes to my mind is the overwhelming feeling of shame, humiliation, and failure.|d1y6hkx|9176
I had one job and I fucked up.|d1y6hkx|9177
I wake up and this feeling washes over me and I lay there shaking, crying, and ripping away at my skin.|d1y6hkx|9178
After shaking comes the vomiting.|d1y6hkx|9179
Anything and everything comes up.|d1y6hkx|9180
I beg myself to keep it in.|d1y6hkx|9181
I am convinced that if it stays in, perhaps even for a few moments longer that I will die.|d1y6hkx|9182
I beg and plea, covering my mouth and forcing myself to keep swallowing.|d1y6hkx|9183
Just swallow, breathe, swallow, breathe....|d1y6hkx|9184
I hold my breath.|d1y6hkx|9185
30 seconds go by and I begin to feel pain, 60 seconds and my face is turning red, 2 minutes the pain is becoming unbearable.|d1y6hkx|9186
I am determined to keep it in.|d1y6hkx|9187
3 minutes, 4 minues I break.|d1y6hkx|9188
I gasp for air and continue swallowing.|d1y6hkx|9189
At some point the act of swallowing becomes too laborious, too painful to continue that everything comes gushing out.|d1y6hkx|9190
In that moment I wish I had more resolve, to continue swallowing, persisting through the tearing of my throat and the blood trickling into my stomach.|d1y6hkx|9191
I wish enough of the pills and alcohol were absorbed into my body to finish the job.|d1y6hkx|9192
I have struggled enough to get here, I want it all to end.|d1y6hkx|9193
I lay soaked in a pool of my own blood, bile, and tears.|d1y6hkx|9194
I think if I can lick up even one pill I will die.|d1y6hkx|9195
Eventually more gushes out of me.|d1y6hkx|9196
I am defeated.|d1y6hkx|9197
I have failed.|d1y6hkx|9198
A second wave of shame washes o er me as I lay weeping, begging every god that I have never believed in to have mercy and end my suffering.|d1y6hkx|9199
Every minute crawls by, eventually turning into an unknown number of hours before I am even capable of moving.|d1y6hkx|9200

Every joyous memory floods through my mind.|d1y6hkx|9202

I am thankful I have failed.|d1y6hkx|9204
I think of times I have spend at work or with friends, times that I have laughed and smiled.|d1y6hkx|9205
I think of times that have been rough and I realize that there is some way to get through it, there is something that is perhaps better at the end of the road.|d1y6hkx|9206
Maybe it will not be better, maybe if will just be over and that will suffice.|d1y6hkx|9207
A few months, perhaps years later I am at the beginning again.|d1y6hkx|9208
It''s maybe that I do not want to die, it is that dying would solve everything.|d1y6hkx|9209

It is a slow progress towards ''better'', whatever that is for you.|d1y6hkx|9219
There will inevitably be slip ups and falls along the journey, but you will get there.|d1y6hkx|9220
When you are in a suicidal and major depressive state remember that whatever circumstances you are going through can be resolved or taken care of in one form or another.|d1y6hkx|9221
You are not weak.|d1y6hkx|9222
Seeking help is not weakness.|d1y6hkx|9223
It is simply seeking help.|d1y6hkx|9224
It is acknowledging you need help beyond what you can provide yourself with.|d1y6hkx|9225
If you choose to take medication, it will take a very long time.|d1y6hkx|9226
Not only do you have to find a medication that works well for you, with minimal to zero side effects, you have to get the right dosage.|d1y6hkx|9227
You might have to try upwards of 10 medications, and perhaps even combinations.|d1y6hkx|9228
It takes time, you have to slowly build up the dosage.|d1y6hkx|9229

[BK][BK]I knew my husband would be devastated, but my mind convinced me that he would be better off without me.|d1ybt93|9268
He was getting quite handsome, he has an adorable dog, and I felt like women would be throwing themselves at him if I were not in the picture.|d1ybt93|9269
[BK][BK]I felt like I failed my clients, and even though I knew a lot of people and was even a little famous in my line of work, I looked through my contacts and could not think of anyone who I would feel comfortable calling.|d1ybt93|9270
I look somewhat professional and can put on an incredibly happy face, but that has only been through years of training and enormous mental effort.|d1ybt93|9271

[BK][BK]When I came to, for one of the first times in my life, I was not thinking.|d1ybt93|9276
I was just feeling.|d1ybt93|9277
I felt terrible; my head ached and I was drenched in sweat.|d1ybt93|9278
I stumbled inside, threw up and just sat on the floor of the bathroom.|d1ybt93|9279
My legs did not want to work, but I forced myself.|d1ybt93|9280
[BK][BK]The my phone rang.|d1ybt93|9281
It was one of my clients calling to make sure I would be there in 3 hours.|d1ybt93|9282
That put me on a mission.|d1ybt93|9283
Somehow I decided that I could do my job and I started preparing to do so, even though I felt like shit.|d1ybt93|9284
I took a shower, got dressed and did everything else I had to do for work.|d1ybt93|9285
[BK][BK]I told my husband later that night and he is helped me to get help.|d1ybt93|9286
I was really careful to choose method that did not leave physical scars, but my body was achy for about a week.|d1ybt93|9287
Id never been actually treated for depression, but I had been non-compliant for several months for a thyroid condition.|d1ybt93|9288

[BK][BK]I actually just recently found a word that describes how I was feeling: acedia.|d1ybt93|9290
Its basically a 4th century monastic word for 1st world problems.|d1ybt93|9291
Part of my despair had been guilt for my own success, and the feeling that I was not doing enough for the world, since I knew I was capable of more.|d1ybt93|9292

[BK][BK]My doctor got me back on my medication and prescribed me zoloft.|d1ybt93|9294
Nothing really changed, but my husband and I started making little changes.|d1ybt93|9295
We started walking every night, eating healthier and talking to each other.|d1ybt93|9296
The biggest thing that happened was that I actually wanted to take care of myself.|d1ybt93|9297
I started looking for a more meaningful job.|d1ybt93|9298
[BK][BK]The biggest change for me happened when I started doing yoga and meditating.|d1ybt93|9299
I never have been very successful at turning off my brain, but there really is something to the breathing patterns that works.|d1ybt93|9300
I need to do this alone, to music to be effective, but I am incredibly energized and focused by doing this.|d1ybt93|9301
I am not saying that yoga is right for everyone, but I really believe that connecting with my body has helped immensely.|d1ybt93|9302
I have lost about 20 lbs so far with no real effort, but I still have a long ways to go.|d1ybt93|9303
[BK][BK]Anyway, this is long.|d1ybt93|9304
But my real lesson that I learned was that it is okay to ask for help.|d1ybt93|9305
I am incredibly fortunate to have a lot of freedom, so I need to take advantage of that and do more.|d1ybt93|9306
I am making big plans again and it feels amazing.|d1ybt93|9307
I might fail, but nothing that happens to me can be any worse than what I tried to do to myself.|d1ybt93|9308
Yes, I failed at suicide, but it was almost like I killed that inner voice that was constantly telling me that I was worthless and did not deserve what I had in life.|d1ybt93|9309
[BK][BK]I know this is long, but I hope it helps someone else.|d1ybt93|9310
TL:DR failed suicide, got help and a new outlook on life.|d1ybt93|9311

I was a mess and could not answer it right away so I let it ring, but the timing of it really tore me up and I got so sick feeling I puked.|d1y0lqp|9316

"Positivity?"""|d1y4p9c|9358
 I am late here but yeah this is my story.|d1ybta7|9359
I did not really do straight up suicide attempt, I first went for a full walk for some part of the city from morning to night and came back at night.|d1ybta7|9360
I do not know why but I just walked the whole way looking at everything, the people and the next day I took some clothes and some money I saved up and got on a bus.|d1ybta7|9361
This is a 3rd world country so I could not really escape to  another state.|d1ybta7|9362
My plan was to go to wild part of the world and just die there while enjoying some moments of my life left to me.|d1ybta7|9363
[BK][BK]After almost 200 miles away I got off in a middle of nowhere and lied to the driver my family had estate around and just went to the forest.|d1ybta7|9364
I had really warm clothes and it was spring almost early into summer.|d1ybta7|9365
So I got to the forest and enjoyed the sense of being alone where no one could see me you know?|d1ybta7|9366
It felt so good and scary but at the same time... so free.|d1ybta7|9367
[BK][BK]I walked about 5 miles off the road and came by a small waterstream in the forest, just put off my backpack.|d1ybta7|9368
I had a very scarce food, embarassed to admit I only brought a premade food and ate a food while we were going on the bus (bathroom break with restaurant) and only a big can of Pringles with a jug of Cola.|d1ybta7|9369
[BK]I did not plan to live there forever so it was fairly simple, I brought something I would enjoy and not last for long.|d1ybta7|9370
That day I set up my things and ate half of my food and just sang like a crazy person doing stupid things because no one could see or hear me.|d1ybta7|9371
[BK]I enjoyed myself, I masturbated and just did everything you could do.|d1ybta7|9372
After some time, this things have decayed I felt very alone, forest was silent.|d1ybta7|9373
I was not afraid of the night but that terrible silence actually got weird, summer was not exactly there yet so bugs were not out and birds seem to have avoided me.|d1ybta7|9374
[BK][BK]I went onto different set of enjoyment, the subtle feeling of where I am and the raw nature that I am in.|d1ybta7|9375
Felt good to be honest, I got my big winter jacket out and used it as a blanket and my backpack as a pillow and slept.|d1ybta7|9376
Woke up in the morning at like dawn, it was fucking cold and I was all soaked up in damp on face and my pants, my winter jacket held out most though.|d1ybta7|9377
I knew it was not enough and planned to make some kind of roof just so I will not get damp because I hate that feeling.|d1ybta7|9378
[BK][BK]I had nothing to do, so I just tried to wake myself up a little and ate the remainder of my food and went on for the shelter.|d1ybta7|9379
I thought I could just build roof but abandoned that idea because damp would be everywhere so I made a little shelter out of dead branch, dry plant, whatever it is I am not sure what its called in English.|d1ybta7|9380
I got a really shitty shelter done and slept in it, it was pretty good.|d1ybta7|9381
But that day I was thorougly bored and just went to look for the landscape.|d1ybta7|9382
I went onto this mountain range and inbetween one of those I saw a fucking deer, I was really lucky but I startled it and it went up like a bastard and run like hell after being still for awkward long time.|d1ybta7|9383
I felt good seing those things but I was kinda worried about wolf now but at the same time thought it was better if I die faster.|d1ybta7|9384
I went back but could not find my shelter for few hours then came in at night and slept.|d1ybta7|9385
[BK][BK]I was so hungry the next day waking up, my Cola was out and I drank from the waterstream.|d1ybta7|9386
So bored, no wolf.|d1ybta7|9387
Thought about hanging myself but I did not bring any rope or something I could use.|d1ybta7|9388
I had a belt but I did not think about it a time cause I am an idiot.|d1ybta7|9389
[BK][BK]I lived there for about a week and a half then when I was fucking around I got spotted by a jeep.|d1ybta7|9390
It was apparently an equalievent of ranger in here searching for me with the police.|d1ybta7|9391
My parents had posted search notice to police and reported it.|d1ybta7|9392
Apparently they searched for bus station and my equal of Social Security was recorded there on a bus, tracked the driver down and asked me where I got off.|d1ybta7|9393
They had been searching for 3 days till they found me.|d1ybta7|9394
[BK][BK]Coming back was the most shittiest feeling, I was kinda happy to be back but I wanted to die peacefully there in the forest.|d1ybta7|9395
I did not like how they would be scared and shit.|d1ybta7|9396
I met up with them in a bout an hour after the spotting.|d1ybta7|9397
They were in their car searching as well, got a mouthful and rage.|d1ybta7|9398
I got on the car and we had the longest fucking conversation ever.|d1ybta7|9399
[BK][BK]Anyways we kinda got the commonground after that, I was an underachiever but when I came back I took some time off and worked a little then went full time.|d1ybta7|9400
I have a better life now, I live alone and I love it.|d1ybta7|9401
[BK][BK][BK]Sorry if that was a long one, but that is what happened to me.|d1ybta7|9402
It was my twisted attempt of suicide or just dying peacefully while enjoying my time.|d1ybta7|9403
I did not think much of hanging there or otherwise I would have but yeah.|d1ybta7|9404
I just thought I would die of starving, but I guess you can do much fkin more when you are in the wild.|d1ybta7|9405

The other two were an antidepressant and clonazepam.|d1y8k3t|9440
I was very depressed for many valid reasons, going through the darkest point in my life, and therapy was giving me a glimmer of hope that the medicines provided by my apathetic toad of a psychiatrist extinguished.|d1y8k3t|9441

I fancied the idea of the ultimate rest for my weary soul, the end of my sorrow through my autumn leaf landing.|d1y8k3t|9443
[BK]I was taking a massive dose of 8 of the largest clonazepam pills available per day, but that night I took more or less 70 pills, all that I had left at the time.|d1y8k3t|9444
With every nightly dose, I felt an overwhelming cloak of lethargy lull me to slumber within minutes.|d1y8k3t|9445
I felt it so much stronger than any time before and I dedicated my brief next minutes to cherishing that which had been good in life and making peace with my departing.|d1y8k3t|9446

[BK][BK]Immediately after, I ceased taking all medications against all medical orders (I know now it was quite dangerous to quit them like that, but to be fair it would not have made a difference at the time, more encouragement even), only to endure several torturous weeks of adapting my body to live without benzodiazepines.|d1y8k3t|9448

[BK][BK]Reflecting on it now, I kind of think that I was just desperate and wanting to relieve the intense suffering I was going through.|d1yasae|10032
But there is a lot life has to offer.|d1yasae|10033
I want to see the world, I have so many experiences awaiting and I would have squandered that.|d1yasae|10034
[BK][BK] I am only 21, so regardless of your past or your situation, any death at that age is a complete waste.|d1yasae|10035
The only constant in life is change.|d1yasae|10036
I am sure I will have even higher highs and even lower lows, but I can also be sure that I will not be doomed to feeling miserable constantly.|d1yasae|10037
The average life span is only around 70-80 years old anyway, which is just a tiny blip in time.|d1yasae|10038
Cutting it short is like flipping an hourglass when there are only a few grains of sand left to fall...if that analogy makes sense!|d1yasae|10039
[BK][BK]If you are feeling suicidal yourself, my advice is to really dig deep into those feelings.|d1yasae|10040
Sounds counter intuitive, but by letting yourself experience those emotions and seeing what is causing them through meditation and such really helped me.|d1yasae|10041
You could come to realise that it is purely a chemical imbalance, which is easily treatable.|d1yasae|10042
Or that it is purely situational, and like I said, that will change in time.|d1yasae|10043
Or a mix of both, which is still manageable.|d1yasae|10044
[BK][BK]Someone cares about you, and your life is precious.|d1yasae|10045
Keep going.|d1yasae|10046

The thought of whoever would have to find me.|d1ycx3t|10048
My depression should not become someone else's.|d1ycx3t|10049
I was worried about what people would think of me|d1ybccf|10050
Pure shock and terror once i realized the gun had jammed on me.|d1yd2um|10051
Then I got so pissed at shit fucking up on me that I went and kicked a hole in the wall in our bathroom where I was at the time.|d1yd2um|10052
Got in alot of trouble for that hole, mostly because I refused to tell my parents why I had gotten so mad to kick the wall in the first place.|d1yd2um|10053
They still dont know why...|d1yd2um|10054
Well, this is my story.|d1zfdpv|10055
(TL;DR I am a homeless youth with life threatening depression, you can figure out the rest)[BK][BK][BK]I grew up in a well-off family (not like rich or anything, be we had enough) living on a 5 acre (~20200m squared) farm with my mum, dad, younger brother and sister.|d1zfdpv|10056
At the age of 8, my parents split up, and mum took us kids.|d1zfdpv|10057
We moved to the Gold Coast, Australia, where to this day, I still live.|d1zfdpv|10058
Moving to a new primary school was tough, since I was the quiet type.|d1zfdpv|10059
[BK][BK][BK]All through school, I was bullied for not having friends, and I could not make friends because everyone was an asshole.|d1zfdpv|10060
By this point, both my original parents had found new partners, and I rarely saw my dad.|d1zfdpv|10061
I have been dealing with depression since about my parents break up, but have never told either about it, because they were not the type to care, so I left it to myself.|d1zfdpv|10062
[BK][BK][BK]I told myself that I would try to make friends during high school, and I did.|d1zfdpv|10063
But my life took a huge turn for the worst after I left school.|d1zfdpv|10064
During my entire life living with my mum, there had been lies flung between her and my dad.|d1zfdpv|10065
Because of that, I had learnt to never trust anyone.|d1zfdpv|10066
The trust issues go further, but I might leave that for another time.|d1zfdpv|10067
[BK][BK][BK]The first weekday (so a Monday) after I had finished Grade 12, I had a very serious ankle injury, where I had torn almost everything in my right ankle.|d1zfdpv|10068
I was in bed for a good few weeks.|d1zfdpv|10069
While I was still recovering, my mum had told me that she does not want me living there anymore, and that I had to go live with my dad.|d1zfdpv|10070
So I moved to live with my dad, just months before my 18th birthday.|d1zfdpv|10071
[BK][BK][BK]For the next couple of months, I was living at my nan''s place (he lived with his mother due to financial troubles) where I had gotten a job.|d1zfdpv|10072
But a couple of months into the job, they had found a better staff member, so I was laid off.|d1zfdpv|10073
For about a month or two, I had been looking for more work, but nothing was suitable for me.|d1zfdpv|10074
"[BK][BK][BK]Then, one morning, I woke up to my dad telling me; 'We cannot have you living here anymore, you need to leave.'"""|d1zfdpv|10075
I was given a day to pack my stuff and leave.|d1zfdpv|10076
[BK][BK][BK]It had not hit me at that point, but I had ended up homeless, with no roof over my head, no food to keep me alive, and not even a single cent to my name.|d1zfdpv|10077
As I prepared m6self for the first night sleeping alone in my car (thank FUCKING god I had a car and a license) I got a call from my mum, she had heard about what had happened, and told me to come back around to her place until I found a place.|d1zfdpv|10078
[BK][BK][BK]So I spent a day or so looking for places, until I came across a homeless youth service based on the Gold Coast; the [GCPHY](http://www.homelessyouth.com.au) (Gold Coast Project for Homeless Youth).|d1zfdpv|10079
I called them and moved into the house that day.|d1zfdpv|10080
[BK][BK][BK]Fast forward a few months, I had moved out of the Crisis Shelter (Lawson House) and moved into a Medium Term Shelter (Jessica Dunne Lodge), I had started to yet my life back on track, and I met some really great people within the system.|d1zfdpv|10081
[BK][BK][BK]There have been days/nights where I feel good, even happy, but there have been times where I have wanted to end my life.|d1zfdpv|10082
One of those nights, I felt so bad, I almost drank a bottle of Bleach.|d1zfdpv|10083
Before I did though, I had told one of the workers, and I was sent to Hospital so I would not try to harm myself any further.|d1zfdpv|10084
"[BK][BK][BK]For what I thought after being sent to Hospital, my first conscious thought was; '""Maybe it was a better idea to end myself."|d1zfdpv|10085
"'""[BK][BK][BK]It has been about 2-3 months since that had happened."|d1zfdpv|10086
I still live in that shelter to this very moment, and I still get thoughts of wanting to end my life.|d1zfdpv|10087
Yes I have had good things happen since then, aswell as bad.|d1zfdpv|10088
But the main thing is now; I am still here, and I would not be here telling you my story if I had gone through with any of my thoughts.|d1zfdpv|10089
[BK][BK][BK]Any that want to say this is not true, go right ahead.|d1zfdpv|10090
This is my true story, what I have had to go through to get to where I am today, is 100% true.|d1zfdpv|10091
"[BK]"""|d1zfdpv|10092
I have been suicidal since I was 11.|d1ybnkb|10093
My best friend and I were victims of physical, emotional and verbal bullying and it ended up with both of us self harming and I took about 15 Panadol pills (the only medicine we had left from all the times I faked sick to avoid school).|d1ybnkb|10094
It did not do much except knock me out  (my first thought after I woke up was 'why am I still here') and leave me dizzy for the next 48 hours.|d1ybnkb|10095
My self harm continued and I tried drowning myself multiple times after because I did not want to do the pills again and I did not have a convenient place to hang myself or jump off of.|d1ybnkb|10096
I am 16 now and I am 6 months clean after I realised how useless self harm is, and also as someone who is into Marilyn Manson and avenged sevenfold and stuff like that I got called Emo a lot and people would mimick cutting and stuff and it motivated me to stop.|d1ybnkb|10097
[BK][BK]I am still suicidal and I still hate who I am but no one knows.|d1ybnkb|10098
"'Huh...'"" It was really weird, too."|d1ybm62|10099
Most of the time, you do not think in words, exactly... it is more like concepts, at least that is how I think.|d1ybm62|10100
"In that exact moment, though, I visualized the text, like it was writing on the page of a book, '""...'"" and all."|d1ybm62|10101
"[BK][BK]What came next was more of an '""oh well'"" type feeling that worked like my normal thought process."|d1ybm62|10102
"There was no extreme emotional reaction right away, just a dull sense of '""guess I am still here.'"""|d1ybm62|10103

I tied my arms and legs together with waits and kinda belly-flopped/rolled into the pool.|d1yc24b|10105

He jumped in and pulled me out.|d1yc24b|10107
But I would already drowned at this point.|d1yc24b|10108
I do not know how long I was dead.|d1yc24b|10109

When I was 13 I tried to overdose.|d1ybrv0|10115
I took a whole bottle of aspirin, probably around 40-60 pills.|d1ybrv0|10116
As soon as I finished swallowing the last pill, I was immediately filled with regret.|d1ybrv0|10117
I realized what I was giving up.|d1ybrv0|10118
I induced vomiting almost immediately after.|d1ybrv0|10119
Not much has improved since then.|d1ybrv0|10120
Everyday I regret stopping myself a little more.|d1ybrv0|10121
I will not bother attempting again though, do not care enough anymore.|d1ybrv0|10122
I am glad to hear so many 'positive' stories here.|d1yc68u|10123
Though I think it is important to remember that there is bias in what we are hearing.|d1yc68u|10124
There will be those who did not succeed who immediately attempted suicide again who obviously cannot tell the story of the gap between attempts here.|d1yc68u|10125
What's more worrying is there might be those who have the horrible realisation they want to live, when it is too late.|d1yc68u|10126

I was 13 when I first started to seriously contemplate suicide.|d1zyi2x|10356
Life seemed like too much of a struggle with little to aim for, I woke up feeling empty, walk around silently, went to bed hating myself for not having what I believed was the courage needed to end it all.|d1zyi2x|10357
[BK][BK]A year of ineffective therapy later and things had not improved much, I could feign laughter well enough but that cold hollow feeling never left.|d1zyi2x|10358
One day I nailed a belt into a beam, put the noose around my neck and tried to make myself kick that chair out from under me for an hour or so.|d1zyi2x|10359
When I finally did, my brother just happened to come into my room, he tackled me down before I had even registered what was going on.|d1zyi2x|10360
I have never forgotten how grateful I was to be saved, I realised how selfish it was to leave my family to grieve, how self-indulgent it was to leave it all behind and most importantly how senseless it was to throw away my only chance at living so soon.|d1zyi2x|10361
Pain, suffering, fears and doubts are only ephemeral, so why not wait them out I realised, maybe it will turn around, maybe things do get better.|d1zyi2x|10362
[BK][BK]Three years later and I think of killing myself everyday, but there is no risk, nor questions to ask myself.|d1zyi2x|10363
I have gone as far as I want and realised that I was wrong.|d1zyi2x|10364
I have been given a second chance, some might thank divinities, some luck, I thank my brother secretly everyday and I value my life and others more than ever before.|d1zyi2x|10365

Whilst I have no authority to promise things can get better, no power to help you directly and no place to be advising you, bear in mind that - whatever your beliefs - this life is unique, do not waste your chance to live it to the full, break rules, codes and norms, experience what you want, this is your life and you have the capacity to better it.|d1zyi2x|10367
Please do not run the risk of losing it all as I and so many have.|d1zyi2x|10368
"For what may arguably have been my most serious attempt: 'Why are there bees everywhere?'"""|d20k6i7|10369
[BK][BK]I was in a psychiatric hospital and decided that my treatment was not going to work, and I just could not stand living for another minute.|d20k6i7|10370
The hospital I was in was designed for long stays and people who were not at immediate risk of suicide (people who became acutely suicidal  while admitted were transferred to a locked SCU ward for a few days, before returning to the clinic).|d20k6i7|10371
As a result of this, the rules about what you could have in your room were not as strict as on a typical locked ward, so nobody had taken my dressing gown sash away from me.|d20k6i7|10372
I went into my bathroom and rigged up a setup for ligature strangulation - which I will not describe in detail - and strangled myself.|d20k6i7|10373
I remember losing consciousness very quickly, and the last thing I remember feeling was a sense of warmth and safety and peace that I had not felt in years.|d20k6i7|10374
[BK][BK]I do not know how much time passed (felt like forever, was probably not too long or the nurse would have come in for checks), but I just remember suddenly hearing...bees.|d20k6i7|10375
Like, a loud intense buzzing, like there was a hive in the room.|d20k6i7|10376
I wondered why there were bees, and then I remember clawing at myself and I must have been pulling the ligature off, because next thing I knew I was coughing my guts out on the floor.|d20k6i7|10377
When I got a bit of sense back and realised that there were no bees, I was panicking - I had a big bruise on my neck and was terrified that if the nurse saw it they would send me off to the SCU place and that felt like a fate worse than death at the time.|d20k6i7|10378
I also remember crying because I remembered the warm and safe feeling and wanted to go back to it and not be alive and trapped.|d20k6i7|10379
I eventually covered my neck with my hair and took my dressing gown sash down to the nurse''s station and asked them to hold onto it for me, and then asked for my prn meds because I felt anxious.|d20k6i7|10380
Idk what they thought, but I did not get sent to the SCU, so.|d20k6i7|10381
[BK][BK]Equal to that attempt was the time I tried to drown myself, but that was a lot less deliberate.|d20k6i7|10382
It was about five months after the attempt I described above, and this time I was dissociated out of my brain, and in said dissociated state I absconded from the hospital and wandered away, apparently eventually jumping in the nearby river in some weird suicide attempt (I say weird because I would definitely plan a self-drowning a lot more carefully than jumping in a river on impulse while dissociated).|d20k6i7|10383
"I have very little memory of any of this and really only '""woke up'"" from the dissociation when I hit the (cold) water, which was a shock - I guess my first thought was really '""what the fuck?'""."|d20k6i7|10384
After swallowing and gagging on some filthy river water, I tried my best to hold on to rocks and things  and swim to the bank to get out, but the current was strong and by the time I got to the river bank I was exhausted.|d20k6i7|10385
The river bank was incredibly steep - it was like...a four foot high stone wall, kind of?|d20k6i7|10386
the river is in a city area - and even though I tried to haul myself up onto the pavement a few times, I could not do it.|d20k6i7|10387
"I was clinging to this pipe thing and crying, and I remember looking up at the river bank and thinking '""I could just let go."|d20k6i7|10388
If I let the current take me I would probably drown.|d20k6i7|10389
"I should just give up on all this and let go.'"""|d20k6i7|10390
I remember thinking about that warm/safe feeling from my previous attempt and desperately wanting to go back to that because I was so tired.|d20k6i7|10391
I decided to try a few more times and then give up - and on the second to last try I managed to throw my leg up over the top of the bank and like...roll up onto the pavement.|d20k6i7|10392
And when I realised that I had fucked up/chickened out from killing myself *again*, I remember just....panicking and not knowing what to do.|d20k6i7|10393
I ended up calling my (long-term, trusted) outpatient therapist, who - bless him - drove out in the middle of the night and somehow found me based on my extremely fuzzy and incoherent description of where I was (I did not remember how I would gotten there), and he calmed me down and convinced me to go back to the hospital.|d20k6i7|10394
"[BK][BK]There were also a handful of overdoses when I was younger, because I did not really know what I was doing, and my first thought on waking up from most of those was '""Goddamnit'"", or something similar - I just basically felt pissed off and really sick."|d20k6i7|10395
Once I attempted to give myself sleeping pills and go down to the river to drown myself (this was years before the river incident above), but I passed out on the street on my way there and ended up staggering home when I woke up several hours later.|d20k6i7|10396
I was pissed off and fucked up about that one too, but I do remember thinking some darkly amused thoughts about how absurdly incompetent the attempt had been.|d20k6i7|10397

[BK][BK]I was not sad that I had not died, but I was not really happy either.|d20li4k|10814

Noise is the last thing I wanted, and all of the hospital nonsense was just loud, obnoxious, turbulent bullshit that I wanted to burn away.|d1y6av7|10820

I just acted like I lived there, it was surprisingly easy, and quite beautiful.[BK][BK]Why?|d1yamsj|10835
I trusted a company called Uber.|d1yamsj|10836
[BK][BK]Like many others, I was an early adopter, bought a very nice car, provided excellent service, and made a  moderate living, i.e.|d1yamsj|10837
35k after cost.|d1yamsj|10838
[BK][BK]Then, Uber started the now infamous rate cuts.|d1yamsj|10839
They even had the balls to say wed make more money.|d1yamsj|10840
Quickly, the rates dropped 50% practically overnight, and the profit portion has dropped literally 80%.|d1yamsj|10841
[BK][BK]After cost, I make $30 per day, driving for 10 hours on average.|d1yamsj|10842
[BK][BK]I have to drive more, to keep a roof over my head, which prevents me from  applying to more jobs.|d1yamsj|10843
[BK][BK]It''s a vicious cycle that is hard to escape from.|d1yamsj|10844
One month, my tires had to be replaced, all 4 of them.|d1yamsj|10845
[BK][BK]I replaced the tires at the expense of rent.|d1yamsj|10846
I then started sleeping in my car.|d1yamsj|10847
[BK][BK]Then, further rate cuts.|d1yamsj|10848

[BK][BK]Now, spring break is over.|d1yamsj|10850
I lasted two weeks before I tried and failed to kill myself.|d1yamsj|10851

Almost like that feeling after you have been hysterically crying for hours, but there is no tears anymore and your throat and eyes are really dry and all you want to do is sleep.|d1y6pdt|10914

She still ended up calling 911 and the paramedics came to my house to check my heart rate (because i felt my heart was beating way faster than normal)[BK][BK]Didnt go to school, but my mother did take me to the hospital 3 hours later.|d1y6hq7|10955
I had to drink chalk to flush my stomach.|d1y6hq7|10956
And in my state since i was still a minor i had to be committed to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation.|d1y6hq7|10957
Got to spend my birthday in there.|d1y6hq7|10958
It didnt help.|d1y6hq7|10959
I was on sleeping medication after that, and by the time i was supposed to be released, i was still so ashamed of facing my peers that i decided to OD on that medication as well, tell them, that way i would have to stay there longer.|d1y6hq7|10960

When I was a preteen, I began my battle with depression.|d1y80r4|11310
At that age I had few resources or frame of reference to determine why I felt how I did.|d1y80r4|11311
It seemed like everyone else was moving forward in their lives and I was just...there.|d1y80r4|11312
[BK][BK]Eventually it got bad enough that I decided it was not worth the effort anymore.|d1y80r4|11313
I swallowed the remainder of a bottle of extra strength Tylenol.|d1y80r4|11314
I do not remember exactly how much, it was over a decade ago, but my 13 year old brain figured it would be enough.|d1y80r4|11315
After taking the pills I felt this ridiculous sense of freedom and relief.|d1y80r4|11316
For the first time in months I felt something other than nothing.|d1y80r4|11317
It was all going to be over soon.|d1y80r4|11318
I laid down to go to sleep.|d1y80r4|11319
[BK][BK]Hours later I woke up puking.|d1y80r4|11320
"My first thought was something along the lines of 'oh, shit'"" and I bee lined to the bathroom on clumsy legs to continue vomiting into the toilet."|d1y80r4|11321
Knowing I had failed was absolutely crushing.|d1y80r4|11322
After puking my guts out, I crawled back into bed.|d1y80r4|11323
No one was home at the time, and to my knowledge no one in my family has ever found out.|d1y80r4|11324
The closest I ever came to telling anyone was my best friend in the following days at school.|d1y80r4|11325
But I did not want to be called crazy (stigma is the word, but my 13 year old self did not have as developed a vocabulary) or put in a mental ward so I never told anyone.|d1y80r4|11326
I also did not want to have to explain to the nurse, the principal, my parents etc.|d1y80r4|11327
about the awful things (or lack of things sometimes) that I felt.|d1y80r4|11328
So I said nothing and continued moving through my life.|d1y80r4|11329
School, homework, sleep.|d1y80r4|11330
I was very mechanical for many years.|d1y80r4|11331
I never attempted again but I certainly thought about it, sometimes daily.|d1y80r4|11332
When I was younger, I was dissuaded by the idea that I would just fail again, but as I aged I needed soemthing more to hold on to.|d1y80r4|11333
At this point I did not want to die, but a part of me was actively self-destructive.|d1y80r4|11334
[BK][BK]Late in high school I hit a turning point.|d1y80r4|11335
I do not remember exactly what happened but it involved something to do with studying existentialism.|d1y80r4|11336
A good friend of mine had said something to about living life to its fullest, to which I internally scoffed.|d1y80r4|11337
But then, I started thinking, although my life was worthless to me, perhaps it could be worth something to someone else.|d1y80r4|11338
So I started volunteering, I started helping people whenever I could.|d1y80r4|11339
Even if my life was empty, I might as well make other people''s lives better right?|d1y80r4|11340
Because I had already failed once to die, so while I was still stuck here, I might as well be useful.|d1y80r4|11341
[BK][BK]My volunteering led me to work with teenagers, some dealing with the same issues I had.|d1y80r4|11342
I find it easy to connect with them sometimes, because the thoughts they have are the same ones I endure.|d1y80r4|11343
I have also discovered something else.|d1y80r4|11344
Regardless of how awful my thoughts are (I still think about killing myself daily), I know that I am winning my battle because I would NEVER do that to the teens I work with.|d1y80r4|11345
I can rationalize away the reactions of my family and friends (they are strong, they would get through it) but I cannot rationalize betraying so many people who have confided in me over the years.|d1y80r4|11346
And that keeps me going, every day, every night.|d1y80r4|11347
When the back of my mind howls at me to end it, I know that I will not -because I am living for more than just me.|d1y80r4|11348
I am a lifeline, I can help others, and killing myself would cause more destruction that I am willing to take responsibility for.|d1y80r4|11349
[BK][BK]Which brings me to the crux of this post: To anyone who feels worthless or numb or has no reason to live, start looking inside and outside yourself for the one thing you can seize and hold on to for dear life.|d1y80r4|11350

Took handful of sleeping pills, around 10-11, still could not sleep, kept thinking about her... May be if i slept I could not have woken up ever again.|d1y8yd0|11555
After a while I gave it a thought and realised how stupid I was !|d1y8yd0|11556
There are no failures in life only lessons.|d1y8yd0|11557
I took a shit load of pills.|d1y9dzi|11558
I remember vaguely waking up.|d1y9dzi|11559
My Fiance shook the shit out of me till I kind of opened my eyes.|d1y9dzi|11560
"He screamed at me 'Don''t you die on me!'"""|d1y9dzi|11561
"My first thought was '""What have I done?'"""|d1y9dzi|11562
The rest of what happened next was a total blur until I woke up a day and a half later.|d1y9dzi|11563
"I still slump pretty low sometimes, but I try every day so I never get there again."""|d1y9dzi|11564
"My first thought was 'If this is hell, god must have a really fucked up sense of humor'"""""|d1y8zhf|11565
oh man a thread I have an answer to.|d1y8ynk|11566
I took aprox 500 pills to try and end myself.|d1y8ynk|11567
The pills consisted of my antidepressants, allergy meds and a few other prescription i was on at the time.|d1y8ynk|11568
after taking them i fell asleep and then mid way through the night woke up and threw up some of the pills and then fell right back to sleep.|d1y8ynk|11569
After waking up again in the morning I though about why I was still alive as well as how shity I felt as the pills I took make me very  nauseous.|d1y8ynk|11570
a few interesting notes after I went to the hospital they did not have room for me so I had to wait over 24 hours after I had taken the meds before I got admitted to the emergency room and then had to drink charcoal which is single handedly the worst thing I have ever had to consume.|d1y8ynk|11571
I ever ended up going to the emergency room and then left and came back because the wait was so long.|d1y8ynk|11572
Dunno if i should have just used a throw away, but woke up, cleaned the wound, disinfected, bandaged it, and taped it.|d1y92sv|11573
Then I cleaned the knife, cleaned the floor, ate food, and went to school.|d1y92sv|11574
I finally thought about what I did, and just sat on top of the monkey bars.|d1y92sv|11575
Nobody knew, there was no note, and idk i just felt empty.|d1y92sv|11576
I guess I am fine now.|d1y92sv|11577
Not sure if this is exactly what you are asking for because my attempt was to jump in front of a train so there had not really been a way for me to survive but I will type down my thoughts after the train passed.|d1y92pz|11578
[BK][BK]I felt confused at first, puzzled as to why I survived what happened, then I started to cry.|d1y92pz|11579
First it was a cry of pain and misery because I realized what I had just tried to do, then of relief and joy because my best friend saved me at the last second and pulled me away.|d1y92pz|11580
He made me realize at that moment that despite how shitty your life may be, given some time and work and everything can be much better.|d1y92pz|11581
Attempted school shooting.|d1y94p9|11582
A boy brought a gun to school and held a class hostage until two other students tackled him and disarmed him.|d1y94p9|11583
[BK]We got to see lots of different rumors fly around afterwards.|d1y94p9|11584
The two boys were thought of as heroes in the town and another teacher bought them the fanciest class rings of there choice.|d1y94p9|11585
When it started an assistant slipped out of the class became ambiguous whether she did it to abandon the kids to the shooter or to alert the police.|d1y94p9|11586
Everyone had their own story of what they were doing at the time.|d1y94p9|11587
My favorite was my friend's Archery teacher, realizing they could not hide in an open field during the lockdown, sent them with there bows and arrows to hide in the hills and bushes.|d1y94p9|11588
I had tried to OD and slit wrists at the same time.|d1y91ni|11589
I ended up panicking because I was high and out of it and bleeding and my roommate noticed and called 911.|d1y91ni|11590
As the emts showed up and put me in the ambulance all I could think was please dont tell my parents.|d1y91ni|11591
There will be so much drama,  please dont let them know.|d1y91ni|11592
[BK][BK]They found out of course.|d1y91ni|11593
I had to stay in a psych hospital around a week.|d1y91ni|11594
I left then was sent back suicidal again for another week within the month.|d1y91ni|11595
I got out around early march(like a month ago).|d1y91ni|11596
Still wish i had just picked one method not half assed 2.|d1y91ni|11597
"'Well today is not the day.'"""""|d1y90vm|11598
"Late to the show, but my grandma attempted suicide last summer and in the hospital told my mom that her first though was 'dammit I am still alive.'"""|d1y91cu|11599

Well , fml .|d1y95jh|11601
I have to study for tomorrow's exam I guess :/|d1y95jh|11602
... Well, that did not work.|d1y99qn|11603
Maybe I should have taken more?|d1y99qn|11604
But I guess because I am here,  supposed to be here for a reason I do not know of yet...|d1y99qn|11605
"'Thank fucking God.'"""|d1y94b5|11606
I was in psych ICU for ten days following, and had a lot of emotions hit me during that stay.|d1y94b5|11607
But, I can specifically recall opening my eyes to the morning sun between my room''s blinds.|d1y94b5|11608
"It took me a moment to even get my brain working, but I was thankful I had failed. """|d1y94b5|11609
I was so upset with myself that it had not worked.|d1y9edt|11610
There was not any feelings of 'yes, I am alive', just this horrible emptiness that I was still this husk of a person beforehand and would continue to be.|d1y9edt|11611
I have a pile of zopiclone sitting on my nightstand waiting for me to just say my final goodbyes.|d1y96xf|11612
I live at home still with my dad and sister.|d1y96xf|11613
There have been days where I have gone all day without seeing them.|d1y96xf|11614
And its occurred to me that they would never know I would attempted something.|d1y96xf|11615
Or succeeded until it was much too late.|d1y96xf|11616
[BK][BK]I have tried before and ended up hospitalised.|d1y96xf|11617
The last time I tried was the Saturday before Robin Williams died.|d1y96xf|11618
Finding out he had succeeded where I had not and having to live in a world where he is not around made things worse overall.|d1y96xf|11619
'Fuck.|d1y94cw|11620
"I am about to vomit -throws up in toilet and cries-'""[BK]Horrible feelings of guilt and self hatred, '""I am too weak and stupid to even kill myself."|d1y94cw|11621

"I have had pretty severe depression since I was a young child so it is hard to tell.)"""|d1y94cw|11623
Since I tried to OD, did not actually start remembering anything until they were strip searching me at the recovery center after my stay in the hospital.|d1y9exl|11624
Honestly I was more scared of how everyone would see me after it all.|d1y9exl|11625
When you are dead there is no need to be afraid or experience the consequences and ripple effects of your actions.|d1y9exl|11626
"'I am so sorry mum'"" I was on suicide watch at the time but I managed to swallow a whole load of pills before my mum noticed."|d1y97bs|11627
"She started freaking out and rang my dad, while she did that, I swallowed more, she was so upset[BK][BK]Edit: That was my last suicide attempt, it is been one year since then"""|d1y97bs|11628
If I had succeeded, what had I hoped to accomplish?|d1y95cl|11629
I would be dead, and the person who attention I was trying to get would not be able to do much, as I would be dead.|d1y95cl|11630
[BK]Also, did I mention I would be dead?|d1y95cl|11631
It took a while to realize how serious it was and how silly I was being.|d1y95cl|11632
Self-hospitalization later and I was more on an even keel.|d1y95cl|11633
It's never over though, you only win the battles.|d1y95cl|11634
I had two attempts i would not call myself a suicide survivor since they were stupid but...ill share[BK][BK][BK]1st time cops stopped me (Foiled by Jagex thanks r/Runescape) (friend i said goodbye to reported me on Runescape :) )[BK][BK]2nd time....well i thought you could OD on caffeine pills turns out you cannot unless its a shit ton but it did hurt ALOT and lead me to nearly stabbing my dad and running from home.|d1y9bpo|11635
[BK][BK]All in all both times i wanted to die but was greatful when nothing worked.|d1y9bpo|11636
"Honestly not sure, proply along the lines of 'why the fuck did that have to happen'"" after I tripped while walking into traffic."|d1y9crb|11637
Ford Ranger slid right over me and the car behind him stopped before hitting me.|d1y9crb|11638
"Tried to pass it off as not paying attention but someone called an ambulance anyway and the paramedics found injuries from self harm when examining me and i spent the night restrained in a jacket at the local PECC unit"""|d1y9crb|11639
"'Fuck, where am I gonna hide everything, my clothes are ruined, and I have to make breakfast because I am fucking starving.'"""""|d1y9crj|11640
Nobody will see this,  but I immediately felt so much regret for my ex.|d1y99jc|11641
She took me to the hospital.|d1y99jc|11642
I could never apologize more for putting her in that spot.|d1y99jc|11643
[BK][BK]We've talked since and it is been OK.|d1y99jc|11644
Pure, straight anger.|d1y9brx|11645
So angry that it did not work, so angry I would have to deal with the consequences.|d1y9brx|11646

"'God fucking dammit you fucking piece of shit failure'"" and just so much rage."|d1y9h2p|11653
[BK][BK]I was on the Aurora bridge in Seattle, drunk as fuck, looking over the edge and trying to work up the courage to launch myself off when a lady cop snuck up behind and handcuffed me before I realized what was going on.|d1y9h2p|11654
It was the middle of the day and I was severely drunk but when I realize I would failed I was so mad at myself for not being able to follow through, I was just screaming in rage and telling the cops to go fuck themselves.|d1y9h2p|11655
"[BK][BK]While they had me in restraints on a bed waiting for me to sober up (my blood was drawn and tested at .40 BAC) the anger turned into shame and overwhelming sadness and I just bawled like a baby in this dark room with a nurse looking in periodically."""|d1y9h2p|11656
That I did not really want to die.|d1y9gfr|11657
That it was damn selfish on my family.|d1y9gfr|11658

"I am not depressed anymore, this was about 2 years ago. """|d1y9gxd|11668
I tried to crash a stolen car.|d1y9lct|11669
It did not work after three attempts in a row .|d1y9lct|11670
Upon realising it was not gonna happen when I could not steer anymore,  I figured it was divine intervention, I wiped a whole bunch of blood off my face and walked to the local police station to turn myself in.|d1y9lct|11671
I remember being annoyed that my smokes were all bloody.|d1y9lct|11672
After I would survived,  my despair was replaced by frustration,  but at the same time elation that maybe there was an undiscovered purpose as to why I am here.|d1y9lct|11673
They had an ambulance take me to hospital where I had my head glued back together and I was released with no follow up.|d1y9lct|11674
"But my initial thoughts were, 'God had not called my number,  so therefore intervened'"" and I would better let the cops know. """|d1y9lct|11675
I was in denial for the longest time, so much so that I essentially convinced myself it was an accident.|d1y9lud|11676
I only remembered my actions and thoughts leading up to that point maybe 6 months later and it was a HUGE realization.|d1y9lud|11677
Maybe it is because I was just intoxicated all the time back then and my memory sucked but it is as if my brain actively repressed my actions leading up to it in order to spare me the pain after.|d1y9lud|11678

Many years and attempts later then something just happened and im not as fucked up as i used to be.|d1yd5k2|11790
I have plenty of scars on my arm to remind me of where i came from, ive thought about getting a tattoo to cover them but they mean more to me than any tattoo could.|d1yd5k2|11791
I jumped into the road, then I jumped out of it when I thought of my mum and sisters and and how devastated they would be|d1yapkd|11792
I was pissed.|d1yara1|11793
the last time I tried to kill myself I took a monster shot of dope...|d1yauxr|11794
If I remember correctly when I woke up I thought a combination of I cannot feel my arms/legs (I was laying on them in a weird position for a while)/ how the FUCK am I still alive?|d1yauxr|11795
?/ holy shit I am gonna puke... / god fucking damnit I am still alive...|d1yauxr|11796
'...shit.|d1yav0j|11797
"'""[BK][BK]I apparently had not known what I was doing, because I woke up that next morning with nothing more than a terrible headache and an uneasy stomach."|d1yav0j|11798
I tried to go to lunch anyway, stuck between planning on doing it again and running to the campus counselor.|d1yav0j|11799
[BK][BK]When I was standing in line some girl asked me how I was doing.|d1yav0j|11800
"Didn''t even know her, but I croaked '""oh, you know, I am alive'"" before I thought about what I was saying, and proceeded directly to the school counselor after that, because the fact that I COULD still say '""I am alive'"" freaked me the hell out."""|d1yav0j|11801
First thought?|d1yayfu|11802
Christ, I cannot do anything right.|d1yayfu|11803
Mom had always told me I would kill myself, and that I was useless, so one of my first thoughts was 'I guess she is right again'|d1yb09l|11804

A couple interesting things.|d1ybq8w|11808
"[BK][BK]I thought how stupid I was, how 'she'"" (a friend of mine) would think of me, and I also realized that if I die now I give myself a 0% chance to make anything better."|d1ybq8w|11809
It''s been 6 years and nothing has gotten better, but what are the chances if I live another 30, another 70?|d1ybq8w|11810
I mean, I do not want to waste my youth but I would rather give it a chance.|d1ybq8w|11811
If I am happy for a moment it is better than what would have been for an instant.|d1ybq8w|11812
[BK][BK]I do not believe in an afterlife, so this life is all I have for myself.|d1ybq8w|11813
I would rather try and fail, instead of not trying at all.|d1ybq8w|11814
If someone was holding a gun to your head and offered to step back 30 feet and let you try and dodge, would you take it, or let them shoot you point blank?|d1ybq8w|11815
That''s me.|d1ybq8w|11816
[BK][BK]My method was starvation.|d1ybq8w|11817
Let me tell you, that shit hurts, and it is slow, and it felt like I deserved it.|d1ybq8w|11818
"[BK][BK]I think my stomach is still fucked up from that."""|d1ybq8w|11819
I have to face my problems now but at least I will be taken seriously.|d1y7ymk|11820

Just reacted.|d1yc5wx|11822
I immediately felt betrayed by my boyfriend at the time (who found me and called the police).|d1yb99u|11823
Then it became overwhelming guilt to how much pain I caused him.|d1yb99u|11824
That sunk in more and more as time passed.|d1yb99u|11825
We got back together after the incident.|d1yb99u|11826
I felt sick around him because I was stupidly selfish that day.|d1yb99u|11827
I do not remember doing it.|d1yb75y|11828
My therapist said I disassociated.|d1yb75y|11829
When I realised what was happening, I was sitting on the floor of my room with empty prescription packets infront of me.|d1yb75y|11830
I tried to pick myself off the floor but could not.|d1yb75y|11831
I had to scream for my parents - I did not want to die.|d1yb75y|11832
Yes, I was depressed, yes I thought about it a lot - but I did not want this.|d1yb75y|11833
[BK][BK]But while I regretted it then, I do not regret it now.|d1yb75y|11834
That moment was my wake up call.|d1yb75y|11835
I broke up with my abusive ex, hired a personal trainer and got a job.|d1yb75y|11836
Life is good now.|d1yb75y|11837
I am happy again.|d1yb75y|11838

Relief.|d1ycj5n|11860
[BK][BK]I tried to crash my auto and die at 100+ mph, but I hit the breaks like 50 meter before and tried to steer away from crashing into a tree (I made sure to crash where I would have hurt nobody else but me).|d1ycj5n|11861
I was going too fast tho and I lost control over the car nonetheless, car was destroyed I was unscratched.|d1ycj5n|11862
[BK][BK]I felt huge relief, and I had 5 amazing years after.|d1ycj5n|11863
[BK][BK]My biggest fear to break was not to spare my life tho, but the fact that I could remain paralized or something and live an even worst life.|d1ycj5n|11864
[BK][BK]But after you are close to dying you appreciate being alive and see things differently, so I lost my intentions to kill myself.|d1ycj5n|11865
For a week or two afterwards, there was a certain out of body experiences.|d1ybf2g|11866
Well fuck, I will just take more... still has not worked, fairly confident I am immortal.|d1ybj99|11867

(I had attempted to overdose and...just got a good night's sleep out of it instead)[BK][BK]It was just a mixture of shame, but also at the same time... relief that I was still here to feel that shame.|d1ycbtb|11878

[BK][BK]To this day, I have no clue why I survived.|d1yc2gn|11906
Maybe there was not enough pills left in the bottle.|d1yc2gn|11907

My exact waking thoughts were 'no no no' for about five minutes.|d1ycdrl|11987

[BK][BK]Anyways...my parents had me put in a psych ward for six days, which was a complete waste of time and an utterly miserable experience.|d1yck53|11995
I did not eat the whole time I was there and barely slept thanks to this kid that would scream and beat the walls and himself whenever someone turned the TV off.|d1yck53|11996
One of my only friends in there was this 11 year old that I played chess with during our free time, and he tried to drown himself in his sink while I was there.|d1yck53|11997
So I just focused all of my energy on lying my way out of there.|d1yck53|11998
[BK][BK]Then I had partial hospitalization, which is basically group therapy that you are required to go to that is at the hospital.|d1yck53|11999
That was actually fun, oddly enough--put a bunch of fucked up teenagers in a room together (I was 17,  18 now) and hilarity ensues.|d1yck53|12000
As far as the therapeutic aspect of it, though, there really was not much value.|d1yck53|12001

And a word of advice to anyone who is stuck where I was?|d1yck53|12005
Talk to people.|d1yck53|12006
The number one thing that I have taken from this whole experience is that even the people you do not think care about you at all, do.|d1yck53|12007

I had felt peaceful to be honest.|d1yd314|12051
Also I had a huge headache.|d1yd314|12052
I would taken about two handfuls of Tylenol pm and as I laid in bed I could feel things shutting down.|d1yd314|12053
Especially my heartbeat, that was the most surreal thing.|d1yd314|12054
Feeling it beating so slowly, and feeling as if I was in a dreamlike state.|d1yd314|12055
I shut my eyes and waited to die, and when it never happened I woke up and went on with the day business as usual.|d1yd314|12056
I tried two more times before giving up on the whole idea.|d1yd314|12057

Pure shock and terror once i realized the gun had jammed on me.|d1yd2vd|12066
Then I got so pissed at shit fucking up on me that I went and kicked a hole in the wall in our bathroom where I was at the time.|d1yd2vd|12067
Got in alot of trouble for that hole, mostly because I refused to tell my parents why I had gotten so mad to kick the wall in the first place.|d1yd2vd|12068

I took a whole bottle of about 500 aspirin, which probably saved me because it was just wayyy too much and my body threw up most of it.|d1yd4ws|12070

She did not for one second consider that I was trying to do the right thing for my brother, she assumed it was a prank/joke.|d1yg7mn|12298
Trying to convince the teachers that I was my mom say I left crying and they were calling my mom (good luck).|d1yg7mn|12299
[BK][BK]I went home feeling defeated and completely useless.|d1yg7mn|12300
I knew I was basically done with school.|d1yg7mn|12301
The teachers were figuring out slowly that something was wrong and I knew from stories my mom had told; my innocent baby sister was going to get taken away and my brother would be thrown in the system and if I was lucky I would not go to jail for stealing.|d1yg7mn|12302
I was 13 and really did not have any reason to believe otherwise.|d1yg7mn|12303
I was scared and could feel my world crumbling.|d1yg7mn|12304
[BK][BK]If I could have kept my brother out of trouble, if I could have helped my mom, maybe if I would been smarter.. all the questions of a 13 year old way way over her head.|d1yg7mn|12305
I decided that I was the problem and I really did not want to go to jail.|d1yg7mn|12306
Everything was going to change, i miggt never see my family again.|d1yg7mn|12307
I was desperate.|d1yg7mn|12308
So i decided my best plan was to end my life on my terms.|d1yg7mn|12309
[BK][BK]I got all of mom's crazy pills from before dad left and some crazy new ones from the last few weeks, I grabbed a pop from the 711 across the street and downed as many pills as I could.|d1yg7mn|12310
My brother called 911 when he got home.|d1yg7mn|12311
It was grotesque, I was almost dead surrounded by vomit, my eyes were completely red from the vomiting and I was barely weazing.|d1yg7mn|12312
(I have no recollection of any of this).|d1yg7mn|12313
[BK][BK]I woke up in the hospital was a cps worker and no one else.|d1yg7mn|12314
I had never once considered surviving and now here I was, I had ruined my family.|d1yg7mn|12315
I had ruined my education, I couldnt help my mom, I had ruined my own suicide.|d1yg7mn|12316
I was useless and now we were all going to be taken away and I would be truly alone.|d1yg7mn|12317

There were 3 in total, but i tell you from first of them.|d1yi56w|12333
I know, my english might be bit sluggish... but, i just want to share this story of mine.|d1yi56w|12334
To help all who struggles with same feelings i had, (and traumas i cannot still get rid of)[BK][BK]I was only 12 and middle of may.|d1yi56w|12335
Spring was coming and darkness of winter passed by.|d1yi56w|12336
At that point, i was bullied for 3 years.|d1yi56w|12337
Lived in fear of people coming to hurt me and making fun of my clothing, appearance or my attitude to nature.|d1yi56w|12338
I like nature, and always escaped into woods and climbed tree so high so bad people i hated could not to climb.|d1yi56w|12339
[BK]One day, like eny other day.|d1yi56w|12340
It started.|d1yi56w|12341
I do not know the real reason they pick me.|d1yi56w|12342
but several months later i was mentally so broken, that i wanted to just pass by.|d1yi56w|12343
Unnoticed and become part of shadows.|d1yi56w|12344
[BK]This is how they killed my bright and smiley me: I got trapped by this one group.|d1yi56w|12345
They made circle around me so i cannot escape.|d1yi56w|12346
They pushed me back in middle of circle if i tried.|d1yi56w|12347
"They started to poke me with names: 'Treehugger'"", and many more rude and humiliating ones."|d1yi56w|12348
I shouted help and cried.|d1yi56w|12349
Then i saw through my teary eyes the first punch.|d1yi56w|12350
These people never let me go before hurting.|d1yi56w|12351
"Leaders '""right hand'"" started it."|d1yi56w|12352
He punched me in shoulder (i was able to dodge it somehow, or otherwise it would be head) Then circle of bad, shouting ppl started to rage.|d1yi56w|12353
I leave rest to your imagination to cover, I am still too broken to tell it in actual words.|d1yi56w|12354
This kind of bullying i was trapped in 3 years.|d1yi56w|12355
[BK][BK]I felt miserable.|d1yi56w|12356
I wanted my abuse to stop.|d1yi56w|12357
I told my parents about that but they thought i was exaggerating the problem and they did not believe it entirely.|d1yi56w|12358
Only idea i came up with was killing myself, since pain mental and physical i felt was far more greater than killing myself would cause.|d1yi56w|12359
[BK]So, i jumped of bridge, in water, (from 34m high) and i wanted to drown to death.|d1yi56w|12360
I know, I had pretty decent percent to survive, and so i did.|d1yi56w|12361
Water did hit me unconscious.|d1yi56w|12362
[BK][BK]I woke up in one shore of that river.|d1yi56w|12363
I was wet, my head was pounding, i puked water out of my lungs and stomach and i was alive.|d1yi56w|12364
I floated almost 1km from bridge i jumped off.|d1yi56w|12365
"My first thoughts was:[BK]'""Why this thing what is me, should be alive?"|d1yi56w|12366

Walked home, and went to shower.|d1yi56w|12370
Put new clothes on and cried in my bed for rest of day until i fell asleep.|d1yi56w|12371
In morning my lungs hurt, i was sick since i caught cold and i did''t speak a word what i had done.|d1yi56w|12372
I was so shocked i could not talk in month.|d1yi56w|12373
This was the point my parents really realized all i said was truth.|d1yi56w|12374
I was sent to psychologist and my parents tried to make me talk again, to tell names of bad ppl.|d1yi56w|12375
I never even realized they had names.|d1yi56w|12376
So, i remained silent.|d1yi56w|12377
[BK][BK]And i still fear them.|d1yi56w|12378

I got on a milk crate, put the cord around my neck and dropped.|d1yjtf4|12466

I laid down on my bed expecting to die but instead had the weirdest trip of my life, so needless to say my thoughts were not exactly conscious for quite a while after that.|d1ymvej|12480

It was the night of the spring dance, so all of my friends were out.|d1ykd4a|12484
I texted my goodbyes, grabbed all of the medication in the house, and started to pour.|d1ykd4a|12485
I became extremely tired, put down the last handful, and fell asleep.|d1ykd4a|12486
"When I woke up, I think I thought 'I wonder if anyone noticed'""."|d1ykd4a|12487
My phone was ringing off the hook from three or four of my friends.|d1ykd4a|12488
My mom was asleep downstairs, she had no idea.|d1ykd4a|12489
I answered the call, let them know I am alive.|d1ykd4a|12490
I sat up, put the remaining medication in the bottles, and put them back.|d1ykd4a|12491
Stuffed my note in my bedside table, went downstairs, and deleted the goodbye from my mom''s phone.|d1ykd4a|12492

He went and retrieved the police officer, even though he was in the middle of class and cannot be away for that long.|d1ykd4a|12495

[BK][BK]***Edited for the whole story when I returned from Chic-Fila[BK][BK]It started off as a stupid move on my part over a pointless argument with my Mother.|d1ykevu|12507
I have a history of Manic Depression and I had thought about suicide a lot.|d1ykevu|12508
I never went all out before, though.|d1ykevu|12509
I ran outside and climbed a tree, wrapped my belt around my neck/tree, and pushed off from the branch.|d1ykevu|12510
The belt broke after a few seconds and I fell to the ground.|d1ykevu|12511
That is when I thought ouch and screw this, I am going to eat a bottle of generic Advil.|d1ykevu|12512
I was then informed by my Mother that the pills would not really hurt me, except for probable my liver.|d1ykevu|12513
I then called my Friend to come get me, so we could drive around or go see his Brother.|d1ykevu|12514
His Brother also had a history of trying to kill himself and I thought that maybe talking to someone else who suffered from depression would help.|d1ykevu|12515
My Friend informed that his Father was home and we both did not really like being around him.|d1ykevu|12516
We drove around for a few hours getting stoned and then the guilt hit me.|d1ykevu|12517
I had to go home and apologize for my stupid actions before my Mother went to sleep.|d1ykevu|12518
My Friend then tried to talk me into going to his house to say hi to his Brother, but conceded that we were all going job hunting in the morning, so we could meet up then.|d1ykevu|12519
I got dropped off, apologized to my Mother, and then got paranoid about falling asleep with all the Advil in my belly.|d1ykevu|12520
I finally passed out at around five.|d1ykevu|12521
Now, I sleep like I am dead and usually nothing can wake me up.|d1ykevu|12522
I actually have slept through two hurricanes.|d1ykevu|12523
Well, around 6 my eyes opened and I saw the caller id lit up.|d1ykevu|12524
I closed my eyes and re-opened them with the phone in my hand and next to my ear.|d1ykevu|12525
"'What''s up?'"""|d1ykevu|12526
"I  asked and my friend says'"" My brother hung himself last night, can you come over?'"""|d1ykevu|12527
Now I had hung myself and I was still breathing, so I asked him if his Brother was okay.|d1ykevu|12528
He was not.|d1ykevu|12529
I had used a well worn belt, but his brother had used a Nylon rope.|d1ykevu|12530
I said okay, see you soon, hung up, closed my eyes, and then realized what was going on.|d1ykevu|12531
I ran to my Mother''s room and informed her of what happened.|d1ykevu|12532
Our families were real close.|d1ykevu|12533
I lived with them for a year and they basically lived with us for around ten years at that point.|d1ykevu|12534
My friend was my Sister''s first real boyfriend!|d1ykevu|12535
Well my Mother said let us go and we both jumped in different showers, took off driving, and made a fifteen minute trip in four minutes.|d1ykevu|12536
We got to the front door and my Friend opened it and just lost it when he saw my Mother.|d1ykevu|12537
I went looking for his Mom and she lost it when she saw me.|d1ykevu|12538
The police were questioning the Father and the body was in the back yard under a blanket.|d1ykevu|12539
My Mother went over to the cop and started chewing his ass over how he was treating my Friend''s Dad.|d1ykevu|12540
She was threatened by arrest, but she would not back down.|d1ykevu|12541
She won the argument and then called a Priest.|d1ykevu|12542
I was in shock.|d1ykevu|12543
This is my own A Christmas Carol.|d1ykevu|12544
I could not put two and two together.|d1ykevu|12545
"I was watching a horrible play entitled '"" How to destroy a Family aka You almost did this to yours'""."|d1ykevu|12546
I walked out front and around to the driveway.|d1ykevu|12547
I saw the paramedics on the driveway waiting on the cops to finish up so they could take the body away.|d1ykevu|12548
I light up a cigarette and walked to the backyard to say good bye to my friend.|d1ykevu|12549
I saw the familiar Vans poking out from the blood stained blanket underneath the basketball goal where I learned how to dunk.|d1ykevu|12550
I lost it.|d1ykevu|12551
What a waste.|d1ykevu|12552
It all hit me how horrible this was and how if I had just gone over there last night it might have changed something.|d1ykevu|12553
My Mother came outside and looked at me.|d1ykevu|12554
Without a word we both knew what the other was thinking.|d1ykevu|12555
I was so lucky that my belt broke and I spared my family from this horrible nightmare.|d1ykevu|12556
[BK][BK]I went home and called my Father, who was well on his way to exiting our lives for better pastures, and he did not answer the phone instead choosing to draft me a letter.|d1ykevu|12557
He gave me some actual parting wisdom.|d1ykevu|12558
"'""Suicide is the last selfish act of a selfish person, set to hurt a select group of people.'"""|d1ykevu|12559
Now I did not want to hear that at the time, but that final message from him is unfortunately is one of the main reasons I am still here.|d1ykevu|12560
Whenever I get too manic and get overwhelmed by the hopelessness, I think about what we went through with my Friend''s suicide and pull back from the line.|d1ykevu|12561
I can understand that sometimes it is overwhelming and it weighs so much that some people just cannot take it anymore, but seriously, think about your friends, family, hell even your acquaintances!|d1ykevu|12562
The guilt and fallout from suicide is something that no one can ever forget.|d1ykevu|12563
Death will come for all of us soon enough, so do not throw away what little time you have if for nothing else than the people you love.|d1ykevu|12564

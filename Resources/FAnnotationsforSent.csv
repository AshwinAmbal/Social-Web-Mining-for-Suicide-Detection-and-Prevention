Well I had attempted to hang myself when I was 15.|hang
So I got myself all strung up by a belt stuck in the door jam of my closet, stood up on a stool, and tried to get the courage to knock the stool over.|hang
I hanged for about fifteen seconds, just long enough to make things start to go black.|hang
And then the cheap plastic belt I was using broke.|hang
The belt broke and I was still here, and 2.|hang
Thank god the belt broke and I was still here.|hang
Bit late, but I tried hanging myself in my closet in the clothes rack.|hang
I used a dressing gown rope which ultimately broke.|hang
When I feel another bout coming on I choose little things to hang onto like the next episode of a tv show I like to come out or realising I need to read a book series.|hang
I came home, boxed everything up so no one would be inconvenienced by having to sift through my things, wrote a letter expressing my deep sense of hopelessness and apologizing to everyone for every small wrong I would committed, outlined a brief will, carefully folded the letter as to make sure it would fit perfectly into the envelope I had labeled **DNR**, and washed down the pills I had with whiskey.|drug|alcohol
"'Fuck, This is embarrassing'""I tried to kill myself on the 1st of February this year, I am currently staying in University halls, the way I tried to kill myself was just to down a bunch of alcohol."|alcohol
I drank a full bottle of wine, three bottles of cider, two beers in the space of about 10 minutes.|alcohol
"I hoped that if I drank them fast enough (I am only 5'""2 and about 120 pounds.)"|alcohol
I would get alcohol poisoning.|alcohol
But alas I just got super drunk and emotionally messaged my boyfriend what I had done, went to the bathroom and smashed my head on the sink intentionally in the hopes of giving myself brain damage, then passed out in his room.|alcohol
(Blood pressure, sugar levels etc etc.)|bleed
It was less of a conscious attempt, but once I took about 20 or so sleeping pills and a few benadrylls.|drug
I deal with ptsd and depression at the time I was dealing with my issues that I hid after coming home from over seas my divorce and I was getting close to losing my apartment I got drunk as hell got in a fight with my then girlfriend I racked my shotgun with my girl in the room and her daughter in the room next to us and pulled the trigger.|disease|alcohol|gun
The shell was sitting on the floor and the shotgun did not discharge.|gun
My first thought when the fog cleared was I should have died and the barrel of that shotgun still looked oddly tasty.|gun
I did have a few tears from all of you.|cut

"'This is either hell, or the worst hangover ever'"" after a ton of under the counter sleeping meds with two bottles of whiskey."|alcohol
"I checked myself in the mirror and my only reaction was '""please, just tell me it is over'"" and then I burst out in barely dry heaving tears."|cut
Yep, two bottles of cheap whiskey, no puke, all the meds taken, what had gone wrong?!|alcohol
After the click of the pistol, I sat there in a state of shock.|gun
I swear I saw an angel floating in front of me, and that is why the gun misfired.|gun
The part that really hurt was my mom walked down after hearing me screaming, saw puddles of blood, and did not stand up for me.|bleed
We lived together for almost a year before I could no longer stand his drug dealing, and inability to pay rent.|drug
I had just taken 45-60 benadryl (not sure how big the bottle was, but it was the whole thing) and did not expect to wake up.|drug
I have done a lot of drugs, but nothing feels stranger than ODing on benadryl.|drug
Except smoke cigarettes and do as many drugs as possible.|drug
I was that person eating alone in a crowded restaurant who burst out into tears out of fear, confusion, frustration.|cut
So I give myself the biggest dose that I could at one time, 60 units of fast acting insulin (it usually takes care of around 600g of carbs) and instantly regret it, so I run to the corner store across the street and get like 4 liters of sodas, and assorted chocolate bars, and dial for a Chinese delivery that arrived about 20 mins later.|drug
 The entire episode lasted an hour before my blood sugars start to level out.|bleed
I saw the smoke, the tire tracks, the stars above (cabrio banger), realized I was still alive, and could not begin to understand how was that possible.|vehicle
"I opened my eyes and saw her and she said 'how could you do this to me'"" and i remember shutting my wyes really tight and hottest sadest tear rolled down my face and i thought the same thing."|cut
Story is as follows:My plan was to take a bunch of my parent's old hydrocodones and drink Southern Comfort until I passed out.|alcohol
Call it cowardice or whatever you will, but as young and as dumb as I was I started drinking before I took the pills.|drug|alcohol
To make a long story short, I blacked out and at some point barfed up the pills.|drug
I decided to hang myself with an extension cord in the rafters of my garage.|hang
During the test run, I slipped off my chair and actually hung myself.|hang
Not so much a thought, more the realization that my mother was not upset because I had just tried to kill myself but was angry because the rope had dug deeply into the ceiling rafter and ruined the paint before it snapped.|hang
I hung myself.|hang
But the rope broke after I would passed out.|hang
It was blood.|bleed
There was a nice pool of blood forming.|bleed
I freaked out and called 911 because I would split my scalp open.|cut
Here I was, ready to die, and now I was scared that I was going to bleed to death.|bleed
He did not like seeing the broken rope hanging from the beam.|hang
As for the split scalp, I received   fourteen stitches.|cut
"'Should have used a better rope, I need a reason to explain my neck'"""""|hang
I took a huge aspirin overdose, about 200 pills, and then got into bed and waited to fall asleep.|drug
It was too late to pump my stomach, I had to be put on a drip and given activated charcoal to drink instead.|alcohol
I don’t want to be at a hospital, I want to be dead.”First thought when the rope snapped a month ago: “All that pain to my neck for nothing.|hang
The first time I was rather young, so when I cut myself and did not bleed, I freaked out and decided ''the universe'' was not going to let me kill myself.|cut|bleed
"Turns out, you can totally cut yourself and not bleed for a variety of reasons; but I thought I had tried to cheat some divine plan and not bleeding out was the cosmos saying 'nice try, but not today'""."|cut|bleed
The second time was a few years later with a handful of pills.|drug
Like I said, I have just.. stepped up the drugs.|drug
Weed is legal in this state, but I still feel like a useless addict because it is one of the only things that can make me immune to despair for a few hours.|drug
The first thing I remember is being in the  ambulance with them forcing me to drink something disgusting.|alcohol
"I still struggle with major depressive disorder every day but I have not thought that I wanted to die for years now."""|disease
When I was 16 I tried to slit my wrist.|cut
I remember nothing clearly after the ambien.|drug
I attempted suicide about 3 years ago, took 190 10mg ambien and 100 50mg tramadol to try an overdose.|drug
At first I tried to tell my family it was just a really heavy night of drinking etc etc, but I eventually broke down and told them everything while we were in the hospital.|alcohol
I am typing this from my phone, and have already taken my medication so I will be asleep shortly.|drug
(She was asking tons of questions)  Why are my arms and legs restrained.|hang
Before anyone can ask, I cut my wrists.|cut
What my mom's reaction would have been if she had found my lifeless body swinging from the rafter on her way to get her work clothes out of the laundry.|hang
Above all, the thing I remember the most was the momement when I kicked the stool out from under me and felt weightless for a split second and realized that every problem I had, every situation I was in, except for the one I had just put myself in, was not permanent and could be fixed.|cut
Almost had a fourth attempt, gun was under my chin.|gun
So I put the gun down and got a tattoo instead.|gun
My first attempt, I used my old belt around my neck and tied it around my neck.|hang
I tied the other end on my bed frame and I tightened and pulled hard till my vision was blacking out.|hang
I jumped off the tallest bridge around, honestly there was no reason why I should still be alive.|jump
Any other plan you might have had soon disappears, and the only option in front of you is your very last option: jump.|jump
It's not because you think you will survive the fall, it is because you accept death and understand that jumping is the easier way to go.|jump
Either stay and suffocate, or jump and feel a few brief moments of peace.|hang|jump
Maybe next time I will just try and find a gun.|gun
The first time I attempted suicide, I hung a belt from a hook on the ceiling, put it around my neck, jumped off a chair, and tore a huge chunk out of the ceiling of my room as I crashed to the floor in a pile.|cut|hang|jump
"'""Second time, it was '""Crap, how am I going to explain these slashes on my wrists to my mother."|cut

Never got a chance to use it as I got so messed up from the dextromethorphan that apparently I spent two days in the hospital constantly trying to strip off all my clothes in front of everyone.|drug
"'""Fifth time, it was '""Crap, my commanding officer saw the slashes on my wrists; I hope I do not get kicked out of the Navy.'"""|cut
"Sixth time, after consuming all the Nytol, Unisom, and alcohol I had in the house, it was '""Dammit, I woke up."|drug|alcohol

Got my older brothers gun (Merica), went to the garage.|gun
I swear my thoughts were ripped straight from the lyrics of a shitty 2000's pop-rock album.|cut
I pulled the trigger with the gun to my temple.|gun
Blood was gushing down the side of my head.|bleed
Turned out my brother only had tear gas bullets.|cut
I managed to make an excuse that it was an accident, that I was playing with the gun in the garage and shot myself by mistake.|gun
I had squeezed the trigger too hard, jerking the gun upwards so the burn-mark on my head was not at a direct angle.|hang|gun
  I tried to strangle myself with a rope.|hang
The knot I tied managed to loosen itself enough so that I woke up again after two minutes (I passed out in < 5 seconds).|hang
I just double knotted the constrictor knot and tried again.|hang
Then I figured I needed a rougher rope that had more friction, so I stopped for the night and went to sleep.|hang
"Still have those rope burn scars on my neck, but I am feeling better after being sent to a psych ward."""|hang
Failed hanging, and nobody knew about it.|hang
I went to sleep after taking an overdose that by rights should have killed me, expecting never to wake up.|drug
"'""I was around sixteen and in the depths of my depression and other psychological disorders without medication when I decided to try and end my life for a third time."|disease|drug
But this time I was sure I was not going to fail, so I took my fathers gun that he keeps for self protection, aimed at my head and fired.|gun
"I am a relatively small girl so the kick from the gun instantly blew me back and as I laid on my parents bedroom floor all I could think was, '""I am dead."|gun
"'""But as I laid there for longer and longer and felt the hot blood rushing out of my ear did I realize that I was in fact not dead and in deep shit."|bleed
All my previous attempts had been relatively quiet, just pretending to have a stomach bug when I was sick from trying to OD or covering the marks on my neck from trying to hang myself with makeup.|hang|drug
But I had just fired a gun in my house and SHOT A BIT OF MY EAR OFF.|gun
I had intended to die instantly so I would not have to face the consequences of firing a gun, but I was now missing a chunk of my ear and laying in my parents bedroom.|gun
Everything was so vivid but once my parents got home it was all a blur, probably due to blood loss.|bleed

By the grace of God, I got over my addiction coming up seven months ago and my life is back on track.|vehicle
I mixed some pills with a bottle of alcohol, all stolen from around the house.|drug|alcohol

When I was teenager and have very deep depression I somehow managed to find my father''s revolver and several bullets.|gun
I saw the tire tracks...|vehicle
They went straight in to the woods...  And the tracks came back out about 10-20 feet down the road and continued to spin until I stopped.|vehicle
I was just so so tired, endlessly tired, so I swallowed a bottle of pills to finally get some peace and quiet.|drug
I was bullied quite badly, when I started comprehensive school, and it was when I would just started there too, and the teachers did not really do much about it, and my family picked on me quite a bit too, so with everything piling up, I started attempting, at first I would get my dressing gown, and tie the belt around my neck, a part of me knew this would not kill me, without me hanging, but I believe on a subconscious level, I wanted to find out if I would be able to hang myself.|hang
Another attempt was to drown myself, in the bath, I submerged myself, and after a few tries of this I got very close, but at the last minute, my body just brought itself out of the water, and I started breathing, and the closer I got, the more unpleasant it felt, so I stopped, I did not really have a thought, after this, I just got out and carried on as normal, but I did find it too unpleasant to try again.|drown
On 12/12/12 (easiest day to remember) I overdosed on 40 Tylenol with codeine.|drug
I had a really bad eating disorder in highschool, so bad that I ended up getting an ulcer (excessive stomach acid from bulimia) and got a prescription for the Tylenol.|disease|drug
I was being reckless at school and smoked some pot and got in trouble so my dad had to pick me up.|drug
decided I could not fuck up anymore than I had so I went home and took all the pills I had left in the bottle.|drug
As an aside, I would been cutting and burning my arms for a while and had been in and out of different psych hospitals for a few years so my dad figured I would do something reckless after the suspension.|cut
Either way one thing led to another and I was at the hospital fighting a nurse who tried to give me Pepcid (medicine to counteract the OD) and I remember screaming and telling them to just let me die, things were all a bit fuzzy from this day.|drug
Six five hundred mg Vicodin and a bottle of rum did not do the trick.|drug
The way I was hung was correct.|hang
Something undid my rope nice and slowly, in mid air as if it was mimicking the movements a human would make holding it, then I felt something lift me and gently place me on the ground.|hang
Been a stern believer in my fate from 90% to 200% from what I saw as I hung there blacking it.|hang
'I see my own blood.|bleed
"'""My first attempt was with two full bottles of Tylenol."|drug

"I was really woozy and felt really '""dry'"" from all the pills."|drug
I then realized where I was, and how much I regretted swallowing a bottle of pills and then I saw the looks on my family's faces and realized that if I have people that care about me that much, how can I be so selfish?|drug
My then-partner found me sobbing in my underwear in the kitchen that night, halfway through making the first cut.|cut

The empty bottles of pills and liquor.|drug|alcohol
After the whole drug trip and recovery 4 days later I went- fuck.|drug
I just sort of climbed the railing and jumped in during high waves because of a storm.|jump
TL:DR Tried to drown myself, was saved by group of homeless men, vowed to dedicate life to helping others.|drown
They did not believe the hanging was accidental though.|hang
Oddly, the one time I overdosed on accident, it was assumed to be a suicide attempt.|drug
"I was given codeine cough syrup and between the pharmacist mixing it at double strength and me reading '""4 tsp a day'"" as '""4 tbsp a dose'"" I ODed big time."|drug
Doc figured if it had been an actual suicide I,would have swallowed the whole bottle, not just the mega dose I thought was a normal dose.|drug
I would not ever be able to see my friends and share our laughter, our tears, our aspirations, our late night talks, ever again.|cut
I tried to hang myself.|hang
On a very desparate day, i watched a video on how to make noose and that night i set it up to just stop me about 1m (?)|hang
I pushed away all other furniture just so i wont be able to reach them and survive, steped on the back of a chair put the noose on and kicked the chair.|hang
Turns out climbing rope can strech out like a motherfucker.|hang
It was the only rope at the house and i didnt even think that this might happen.|hang
I cut the rope and went straight to a mirror, i had a huge round burnmark around my neck, (went away after a year) and some hair pulled out.|cut|hang
When I was in something in between 1:st and 5:th grade i tried to strangle myself with a jumprope and later on I tried to do the same thing but with a regular belt.. Been depressed and suicidal for years, but now im just depressed.|hang
It''s funny because I take that for granted a lot, but that gun should not have jammed.|gun
"Like, '""Sure, life may go up again, but that''ll just give me a higher place to jump from.'"""|jump
All I remember of the night before was taking the pills going to the bathroom and walking around in the dark unaware of where I was I got really mad because I kept banging my face on the walls and stubbing my toes,then all I remember is waking up with vomit all over me and the bathroom.|drug
"On a related note about two years later under the influence of ambien I was in my usually state of mind for being alone which was talking to myself about the need to kill myself and how much I hate myself when I had the realization that '""If anyone else talked to me the way I talk to myself I would fucking kill them; I have wasted three years of my life like this, either I can kill myself now or try something different.'"""|drug
"'""I have actually tried a couple of times, with the worst experience being trying to hang myself."|hang

I attempted to poison myself with carbon monoxide in my car far in an isolate parking lot, far, far away.|drug|carbon monoxide
Like a drunk confusion.|alcohol
First time I pulled the trigger and the gun did not go off I was pissed that it did not work.|gun
Turns out my dad had removed the firing pin when he inherited the gun.|gun
A couple of years later I overdosed my self with 100 units of my fast acting insulin and a bottle of southern comfort.|drug
I was puzzled and upset that the shotgun did not go off.|gun
To this day, it still amazes be that the gun did not fire.|gun
After the overdose wore off and I was in the psych unit, I flipped shit at a nurse and slammed my door.|drug
I was mostly really angry I had failed at killing myself and completely out of it from overdosing and monoxide poisoning.|drug|carbon monoxide
"'My mother loves me, what the hell am I doing'""Id had a huge fight with my mum, and on my newly prescribed medication i just blacked out."|drug
I have no recollection of conciously deciding to take all those pills, but i remember lying down, feeling a little drowsy and then rushing into the bathroom to try and make myself throw up when the realisation fully hit me.|drug
My mum took me to the doctors immeditately  (i dont have a gag reflex so i couldnt make myself throw up) and they said the dose i took wasnt lethal, that id just be sleeping for a long time.|drug
At first my mind jumped to: where am I, what is this, what is going on, why cannot i move?|jump
Eventually you remember getting home belligerently drunk and running into the bathroom and...that bottle of pills...did i down it?|drug|alcohol
I celebrate that year the same every year, getting as drunk as i can.|alcohol
Tried hanging myself with an Ethernet cable from my doorknob.|hang
I have 11 unsuccessful suicide attempts already from hanging myself to drinking acid.|hang|alcohol
I had drank a full months supply of my epilepsy medication.|drug|alcohol
Not sure if this counts, but I had a somewhat intentional heroin overdose last year.|drug

"'""That was my last shot of heroin (9 months ago) and my life has since been fucking great."|drug
I was alone at college and I have suffered from PTSD, severe addiction, and Major Depressive Disorder.|disease

I never consciously tried to overdose but if I just so happened to and died from it well that would have just been alright.|drug
"'""I hope mom does not tell dad'""I tried to hang myself when i was 12."|hang
But after getting cut down by my mom I sort of snapped back into reality with a whole different perspective.|cut
Probably the first bad trip I have had with any kind of drug tbh.|drug
"So no more overdosed pills for me unless it is cyanide."""|drug
Middle of winter, tried hanging myself from a tree, woke up lying in the snow with a branch crushing on my chest.|hang
When I was 13, I tried to OD on pills.|drug
"I remember that while the pills were beginning to take effect, my mother and brother were fighting over a school project of his and I  remember thinking 'Can''t I die in peace?'"""|drug
3 years later and I am not really suicidal anymore thanks to medicine, some things my therapist said (but not many), my friends, and various support groups for dealing with my family.|drug
First time I tried to hang myself, door broke off what I was trying to hang my self on.. Knocked me out, woke up thinking 'IVE DIED AND IM IM IN MY BEDROOM?!|hang
Then realised due a lack of oxygen and head injury was just making me confused..Second time many years later threw myself over a bridge at night onto train tracks, hit a post/ pillar in he middle of the tracks, landed on the floor managing to knock myself out.|vehicle
I tried with an old belt tucked into the top of my closet door, I remember visualizing what happened when you die as I was choking, it was a really surreal moment, the blacker it got, the more vivid the image in my mind became, it was really beautiful, I saw clouds.|hang
"the belt snapped just as I was about to fade and I fell to the ground, I felt really sick and the entire room was spinning, I remember looking at a mirror on the wall next to me and thinking, 'is that me?'"""|hang
Only things that made me stop were when my PTSD triggered flashbacks happened and I froze up.|disease
A day after Christmas last year I found myself extremely desperate to make my life come to an end, so conveniently my parents were out in town and we just happen to own two rifles and some ammunition from when we go shooting at a gun club.|gun
You can probably see where this is going but yeah I decided to get one of the rifles out and load it with some ammunition.|gun
So I did exactly that and then I put the rifle up under my chin because that was easiest way I found to have it.|gun
I had the gun loaded and the firing pin ready.|gun
TL:DR - Loaded gun, realised I did not want to do it, accidentally pulled trigger and luckily the bullet jammed in barrel.|gun
Tried to hang myself at 20.|hang
Still think about suicide almost every day (26 now) but it is easier to manage with therapy and medication, and I know I will never try it again because that thought about the people who would be affected still chills me to the bone.|drug
I swallowed 66 Ativan during a time when I was homeless for a few days in 2011.|drug
I turns out I had swallowed them and for some reason in my drug-induced delirium decided it was okay to try and drive somewhere else - I ended up hitting a parked police vehicle that had an officer just sitting inside doing whatever.|vehicle
The nurse told me that I had repeatedly tried opening or smashing open the window on the 3rd floor I was on so I could jump.|jump
I had to have been going >5 MPH when I hit him as the officer said it was no more than a light bump for himself in the vehicle.|vehicle
My wife is passed out drunk.|alcohol
I tried to overdose on cough syrup and woke up a few hours later higher than I have ever been in my entire life.|drug
"Please hang in there, seek help, and keep fighting. """|hang
I tried to overdose on about 400mg of concerta(its an amphetamine like adderall.|drug
After I took the pills and realized what I had done and I was incredible scchrideI texted all my goodbyes and I waited to die.|drug
Never had I drunk something so disgusting.|alcohol
I threw up a bit but drank all of the suicide cocktail.|alcohol
As I was swallowing every pill I could get my hands on, I felt sad knowing that if this was the end of me then my best friend would probably never even know I passed & think for so long that we had fallen out or that I hated them.|drug
 I found out later, I had drank half a bottle of vodka and taken a bunch of painkillers and sleeping pills.|drug|alcohol
Woke up, tried to fight the nurse, police came in, cuffed me, they gave me a sedative and 15 hours later I woke up.|drug
TL;DR: Fucking destroyed my liver with painkillers, sleeping pills and a bunch of vodka.|drug
As much as your friends or society tells us that suicide is never the solution, when youre in a dark place and youre suffocating,  tearing up the wound wide open big enough to numb it seems to be the only option.|cut

dad found out i was taking like 20 ambien and like a bottle of valium and it was too late and i passed the fuck out when the ambulance came but i didnt do shit other then make me feel like shit for the next 3 days... my parents didnt even say anything to me after that... asked to see a tharapist but it never happened lmao if i die at 18 i just know i was a huge burden on my whole family and they all hate me for being a fucking loser... tried so many times after that with even more ambien and benzos but now i know it will never kill me but its all i have and im too much of a pussy to slit my wrists... fuck cutting yourself i have too many scars that will never go away|cut|drug
As i was laying in some sewer gutter over looking a freeway, my mind and body were shutting down already in and out of consciousness, i looked down at my arm gushing with blood, i remembered my little sisters (8yrs old) face before I left the house earlier that day,  she was telling me how she wanted to play outside with me.|bleed
I remember thinking of her and telling myself i have to wake up and stop the bleeding somehow... the place i was at was on a trail behind a park, i started to drag myself towards the park with blood gushing down my arm i do not know how but i manged to tie a tall grass around my upper bicep to slow the bleeding, drank a lot of water at the fountain and washed the blood from my arms so i can make it home without anyone knowing what was going on.|bleed|hang|drug|alcohol
 I never went to the hospital, parents never found out,  they asked about my cut though about a month after on a day when i wore a tank top and that is the first thing they noticed.|cut
i still have a scar, i cut myself on my bicep right where the vein is, that no one knows how it got there, except for you guys first time telling anyone about this.|cut
I planned to OD on my sleeping meds at school an hour before lunch (since it took an hour and a half for my normal doses to kick in) so that I would be able to spend my last bit of time with my friends (my *family*.)|drug
To keep things basic, medications do not work that way.|drug
I OD''d when I would planned to, but having taken 16 times my average dose, it only took about 15 minutes for the effects to kick in as opposed to the hour and a half I had been expecting.. and there is not a peaceful fucking thing about overdosing.|drug
I was in the middle of English class, my last class before lunch, when I began to feel the effects of my overdose.|drug
I would OD''d to chase away the pain, not to find myself humiliated and scared in the middle of a room filled with people, the majority of which I hardly knew.|drug
I tried to strangle myself with a belt, it did not even knock me unconscious.|hang
It sent her into a meltdown, which is understandable when you walk in to see your roomie hanging from her sandal straps.|hang
I had tied myself and moved the bed so there really was no backing out.If they had not cut me down, I would not be here.|cut|hang
I do not even cut anymore, even though i miss it and consider it sometimes.|cut
It was when I woke up in the hospital after getting my stomach pumped, I decided downing as much sleep aid as humanly possible and washing it down with whiskey at the age of 15.|alcohol
I do not remember much of the next day or two, but apparently I tried to OD.|drug
The worst part was, until 3 days later, when they finally had managed to get in touch with my b/f and my doctors office, they withheld all of my MS drugs.|drug
I quickly found out that I was restrained with very limited mobility, so I tried to sit up.|hang
My forehead was also tied down, so I arched my neck and back until the restraint slipped.|hang
I still have scars where I ripped the IV out of my right arm.|cut
I had tried to hang myself and I guess all of the blood was rushing back into my face.|bleed|hang

My father taught me the combination in case of any emergencies in which I would need a gun to protect myself or the house, or grab important documents from it in the event of some disaster.|gun
I grabbed the first pistol I saw, a colt .45 that was my grandfathers.|gun
Now we kept a separate ammo can but in the safe was a blue box of old ammunition for the pistol of my choice.|gun
Any and all sounds and bent noose just ceased.|hang
All of that was just the 10 seconds it took for me to put the gun to my right temple and pull the trigger, hoping for nothingness.|gun
I am now on medication.|drug
Not really doing better so I am going to ask my doctor about trying different medication.|drug
The gun just refused to go off, both with freshly reloaded rounds, and factory loads.|gun
I got pissed off and chucked the shotgun under my bed and took a nap.|gun
The next week I tried sleeping pills but an ambiguous amount - sort of like Russian roulette with pills.|drug
When I tried to pull the trigger, my finger was too high in the trigger well and the gun did not go off, thank god.|gun
I dropped it and laid in my bed and thought about how that moment would have effected everyone that I knew and loved me and I just could not do that to them, so I sold my gun.|gun
Maybe this dosent count as much as others, but I had the noose set up and everything, and just as I was about to kick out my desk chair from under me, I saw (yeah this it totally ridiculous) a ticket stub from a football match I went to.|hang
Took down the noose and went back to bed.|hang
I had broken many bones in my face and my hip, blood was gushing down my face.|bleed
I was 15, tried to hang myself with bedsheets and TL;DR my half-assed noose came undone after I passed out, I fell, and smacked my head really fucking hard.|hang
I am talking acetaminophen and booze.|alcohol
"I was going shot for pill when a girl I was sort of seeing at the time was invited over by my roommate (we were all old high school friends) and she bursted into my room with a big old 'It''s great to see you because this is probably going to be the start of  a significant relationship between us!'"""|drug
I obviously stopped trying to poison myself because I was now entertaining a guest.|drug
"I was new to alcohol at the time and I felt woozy. """|alcohol
"'""The morning after a party where I took a bottle of whiskey,  wearing only indoor clothes,  ventured around and drank,  sobbing about a woman I loved but who never loved me back."|alcohol
"All they know is that I just got real drunk and went out for a cigarette,  fell and was too wasted to make it back. """|alcohol
I do not know why I am different now - I have never seen a therapist or gotten pills, I guess it is just like the end is in sight.|drug
"'""Second time (age 16): I told my friend after overdosing and she convinced me to go to the hospital."|drug
"I am going to leave the hospital and go lie down on the train tracks.'"""|vehicle
Thank Goodness, two security guards physically restrained me from leaving.|hang
But I also do not really know how to do it - no high buildings in my area, not an easy access to guns, not a huge amount of pills availabe.|drug|gun
Turned out i missed the wall and hit a grass embankment next to it, jumped my car almost 100ft, through a telephone post and landed on some guys fence in a field.|drug|jump
Rather, the pills that I swallowed would have destroyed my kidneys, and would have killed me slowly over the next few months.|drug
So I did not really lose consciousness; I just swallowed a bunch of pills, washed them down with some gatorade, wandered around campus for a while, came back to my dorm, wrote a suicide note, and then called 911 on myself.|drug
"I am not going to unilaterally say anything about people who attempt suicide, but in *my* case, a severe dose of '""You''re 17 and you do not know shit about shit'"" perspective was in order."""|drug
I had jumped from a tree and instead of dying like I had proposed to do, I only ended up breaking my wrist on impact.|jump
I did not have a lot of options, and did not really plan it out, but I brought a bottle of caffeine pills with a combined total of about 8g of caffeine.|drug
I spent the next two weeks in the psych ward before being released on the condition that I continue medication and therapy.|drug
It was winter and I turned off the heat, only put on one blanket, and figured I would drift off and hypothermia would get me.|hypothermia
I had found two random pills at my house (both of my parents take anti psychotics) and I thought it would be strong enough to kill me, so after lunch one day I sat on the Oval and took both of them and just lied there smoking until I passed out and then woke up to the sound of the bell and got up and walked home.|drug
The second attempt was about two years later and I tried it by cutting as deep as I could on my wrist in the bath, I could not get the guts to cut deep enough so I just kept cutting and cutting all over my arms and legs until I passed out.|cut
No one did and it had been a couple of hours, I think I may have taken some sleeping pills as well so I would not feel the pain as bad.|drug
I took a whole bunch of pills and my grandparents found me, called 000 and saved my life.|drug
A few days after I got home I thought I was alone so I tried to slit my wrists, but my sister walked in on me and I was back in the psychiatric ward for another 3 weeks.|cut
I do not know why this time was different, maybe the medication was starting to work, or the intense therapy or seeing the impact it had on my family (initially I thought they were faking it because they would obviously be better off without me) but when I left hospital for the 2nd time I still wanted to die but I no longer had the will to commit suicide.|drug
I am now in a really good place, it has been 15 years and I am still on medication but I had a major setback when I tried to reduce the dose so if I need meds to stay healthy i figure its a small price to pay.|drug
everytime i had a depressive swing my gf would plead with me to go to someone, to talk to someone.|hang
I used to cut but only to hurt and scar myself.|cut
I am a stupid teenage angsty dumbass who figured anything in my medicine cabinet will eventually be enough to kill me.|drug
Couple months later I tried hanging myself with the cord of my computer mouse.|hang
Right before jumping I realized that my ceiling fan probably could not support my weight, and that I would likely survive and end up with a horribly mutilated mouse.|jump
My exes sister tried to swallow two bottles of pills, then called him seemingly out of the blue, while we were watching tmnt, and was crying and telling him she loved him.|drug
His family has a history of mental illness, and she definitely was suffering from some form of it, and I hope she has gotten help, but I was a total cunt in the relationship and we do not stay in touch at all.|disease
She was just going through some intense drama with her friends, and for whatever reason, two bottles of pills was a quick answer to a hard question.|drug
When I was 16 I attempted suicide by jumping off the 6th floor.|jump
As a result of that the Nurses had to tie my hands to the side of my bed.|hang
I ended up with a calcaneum fracture, a broken lower jaw, half my nose was torn off and pneumonia which worsened into pneumothorax.|cut
I had 13 bags of blood transfused into me during my stay in the hospital too.|bleed
I think it was because in the hospital I managed to say everything I held inside to my parents and cry all the tears I held back throughout the years.|cut
im extremely embarrassed to admit that i once had a drunken night where i got into a fight with a good friend, had a big fight with my girlfriend at the time and went home and broke a bottle over my head, smashed some windows, sliced my arms up and swallowed about 40-50 pills, i was 15. i woke up and could taste metal and could hardly remember what i had done, instant regret.|cut|drug
Decided to just sit in the bathroom and swallow as many pills (tylenol) as I could.|drug
Went to bed fully expecting to die (I did not know too much about how much Tylenol it would take to kill me) I woke up the next morning and felt the lowest I have ever felt.|drug
I got hammered drunk, took a handful of sleeping pills, and laid down in bed to die.|drug|alcohol
This was not a failed attempt but at the last moment before I was about to pick between OD and hanging myself.|hang|drug
I took a whole bottle of gravol and downed it with whiskey, i tried to find as many pills as I could and when I was about to pass out I realized I did not wanna die, I had been contemplating it for some time before going ahead with it.|drug|alcohol
"I texted my cousin I said, '""I just took a bunch of pills and alcohol, I dont wanna die anymore'""last thing I remember was passing out as they picked me up and lugged me into the car."|drug|alcohol
"'I will never be able to drink again'""I had taken a bunch of over the counter pills, mostly midol which basically destroys your liver and I have a heart condition so the caffeine was making me have heart palpitations."|drug|alcohol
"'""I overdosed on pills, then ten minutes later I went downstairs to tell my Mum as I believed I had failed and not taken enough."|drug
I do not remember much after that as I started dipping in and out of consciousness, but I properly woke up in the resuscitation room later in the evening (unsure of timings) in A&E to see an old man across from me, covered in blood and struggling to breathe.|bleed
"For anyone interested, my parents finally separated a few months after my attempted overdose and things have been so much better since."""|drug
After cutting my wrists, eating a bottle of sleeping pills I woke up groggy in the bathroom in the morning around crusted blood and a shitty illegible drunken note I wrote and I realized how fucking sad and pitiful it was.|cut|bleed|drug
I washed off all the blood off the floor, the sink, and my arms.|bleed
So I slit my wrist, and I am relatively sure that I did it right and the bleeding from my wrist would have killed me.|cut|bleed
I snapped out of it and immediately stopped the bleeding.|bleed
I am now on medication (I was not before and I did not want any because of my very negative experience with prozac) and I will be receiving counseling, which my family and I have struggled to obtain.|drug
I met another guy who slit his wrists because he found his child dead under the Christmas tree, electrocuted by the lights.|cut|electrocute
I had OD'd, but the hallucinations scared me so much to the point that I ended up calling my best friend.|drug
Immediately I ran to the bathroom because my body decided it is time to get these pills out of you.|drug
It was right after thanksgiving dinner with my family(I had been feeling like shit for weeks and holidays are always worse) and we got home around 7ish, sisters and mom left for shopping a half hour later, so a couple minutes after they had left I grabbed my meds(I was taking 5 different pills and if I remember correctly I was consuming about 1050-1075mg of meds a day) and I poured a few into my hand(the largest was 500mg and the smallest was like.. 15mg I think) and I downed them.|drug
I took a bunch of pills.|drug
Thankfully, I had taken the pills with some spoiled milk, so I immediately puked everywhere, and I realized that I would be saying goodbye to all the people and things I cared about.|drug
For me it is like being in a drunk state, so much crying and hard breathing.|alcohol
My next suicide attempt is kind of hazy, I know it was mid June 2012, and I know that I did a significant amount of drugs to try to off myself and I remember telling my bf that I was dying and then I remember throwing up quite a bit and hoping it had been long enough that I would absorbed the pills anyways.|drug
Art therapy saved me more than the medications did, I am down to just the art now.|drug
Several years ago, I attempted overdose.|drug
And I mean EVERYthing: the humming of tires as traffic dinked about nearby was tied to bee-buzzings and a memory of a cello section from an orchestra rehearsal.|hang
Everything became lightly synesthetic, and I sat in the grass with a mix of happiness and dismay, just...drinking it in without judgment or decisions.|drug|alcohol
So I survived because I did not pull the trigger, and neither did the police...Gun pointed at my head, sitting outside my apartment complex, had written the note, called the police saying someone had been shot.|gun
So I am staring at about 8 cops pointing assault rifles at me, telling me to drop my weapon or they will shoot.|gun
So I put the gun down.|gun
he has ever met, said he had never seen someone have that many guns trained on him, provoke the cops, have a loaded gun out, and live.|vehicle|gun
I jumped off the overpass, 40 feet to the train tracks below.|vehicle|jump
I took about 10 painkillers and tried to drown myself in a bath tub by filling it with water and holding my head under the faucet so that if I struggled, I would hit the faucet and stay in the water.|drown
I jerked my head back from the tub and gasped for air.|hang
Tried to overdose on prescription meds in college.|drug
But in that brief moment of loneliness and desperation, I realized I had more to live for and that I needed to find more positive people to hang around.|hang
I made a bunch of lame attempts in middle school and highschool that in hindsight were probably never going to work (tried drowning myself a few times but instinct always got the better of me and I burst above the surface for air; tried cutting wrists but I got too scared of the pain).|cut|drown
It always just made me hate myself more for lacking the bravery to follow through (and as many people will tell you, suicide is truly not the coward''s path: it takes guts to follow through)Most recently, I had been having rather frequent (a few times daily) suicidal thoughts, and was planning on jumping out of my 4th story window.|jump
I want to try medication but I cannot afford it myself and my parents do not believe in prescription medication so they will not help me get it.|drug
I tried to OD on tylenol when I was twelve.|drug
I was tired of being thrown around between family members, spending my days skipping school to find ways to care for my siblings, since my mother worked full time and my father was out of the house 13 hours of the day, and when he was home he was strung out high or drunk and abusive in every way.|alcohol
My first attempt was with a rope, but the rope broke.|hang
My last attempt was with a revolver that did not fire until I tried to check it over to find out why.|gun
I have tried, pills, ropes, jumping from heights, drowning, and lastly a gun.|hang|drug|jump|drown|gun
I threw up the pills.|drug
(Un)Fortunately, I underestimated the strength of my sleeping pills.|drug
I woke up from being blackout drunk, vomit and pills in the toilet.|drug|alcohol
"'""I had awoken that morning to discover the dried blood on my wrists."|bleed
Alcohol and a massive amount of pills.|drug|alcohol
Puked a lot of the pills out before they desolved, guess I am mainly alive as I was out of my chosen daily poison (Rum), so I had resorted to whatever I had laying around, in this case, vodka, which I hold a lot less efficiently.|drug
So when I downed the pills I puked most of them back up.|drug
There was an old bunk bed in my old room, and I decided to hang myself in it while laying down.|hang
I was all rigged up, laying face down with the rope choking me out, when I heard some of my brothers friends start to walk in the front door.|hang
I got up, untangled the rope and acted like I was cleaning.|hang
I did not quite make it to the jumping part, I had planned to, but had not quite worked up to it yet when somebody called the police and an ambulance.|jump
I routinely went several days in a row without being able to sleep, even with the help of pills, and would have nightmares whenever I did manage to get some sleep.|drug
Which kinda scares me, because I still feel low a lot of the time, and occasionally something will ''set me off'' and I will drink myself stupid or something, I still have involuntary suicidal thoughts regularly.|alcohol
Back last November, I had to deal with some pretty bad crap, and amidst the worst of it, one night I decided to just take my medication.|drug
And again, and again eight more times, for a total of thirty something pills.|drug
I suffer from some pretty heavy PTSD after two tours in the Marines and getting shot in the leg.|disease
Used an electrical cord and tied it to the door handle - I was afraid the closet beam would break.|hang
I took a handful of Benadryl.|drug
I will admit I suffer from depression and have currently started taking medication to help battle it.|drug
Wasn't much vomit, and was 6 hours+ since I would taken the pills so still thought I would done enough.|drug
Any moment I was ready and prepared for my liver to start giving out (the expected consequence of the OD) and then I knew that the end would come.|drug
My Mom also cared more about her sex life, her friends, and her pot than whether or not I was trying to take myself out so even when I should have been hospitalized, I never was.|drug
I did get feint from blood loss a few times and once of my overdose attempts knocked me out for a few hours the way Nyquil might, but that was it.|bleed|drug
Most of us either have a mental illness, severe trauma, or grew up in a shitty environment, or a combination of all of those (*waves* Hi, hello, right here).|disease
The first time I gave it a real go was by overdose.|drug
So I took whatever I could get my hands on - I know it was mostly my sleeping pills but I do not remember how many or what else was mixed in there.|drug
"I took an overdose of a beta blocker (massive OD of Propranolol) my housemates had driven me to it, and when they found out, one accused me of faking, the other said 'Well, he clearly wants to die, so let him.'"""|drug
After consuming close to 500 sleeping pills, I awoke in the ICU extremely confused and disoriented.|drug
but out of it enough to not realize that my arms were restrained.|hang
I tried to rip out my own catheter and felt nothing <---- this makes me nauseous to even really ponder today.|cut
Her answer made my blood run cold.|bleed
I am normally a sentimental schmuck...but I did not leave a note, never said a goodbye, I simply drove around town buying pills, my tear stained face turned to a brave mask, and checked myself into a hotel to end my life.|cut|drug
I was still very out of it from all the drugs and maybe from the seizure I had?|drug
She took like 20-25 sleeping pills and went to bed expecting to never wake up again.|drug
(Three full bottles of OTC sleep aids + a LOT of booze.)2.|alcohol
I had taken a bunch of sleeping pills.|drug
All the cliches and pills thrown my way never changed that.|drug
I had 10 minutes left in my shift before I was going to drive to the Golden Gate Bridge to jump.|jump
As I put the gun into my mouth and tried to pull the trigger, I realized I forgot to take the safety off.|gun
In the moment as I just pulled the gun out of my mouth I just threw it across the room.|gun
Then it hit me like a ton of bricks that it was the first time I had a single positive thought in so long that I finally broke down and cried the good tears.|cut
I am late as fuck, but I took 56 diphenhydramine sleeping pills on a Thursday night and do not remember much until Sunday night.|drug
The first time, I tried to hang myself with a length of chain, which slipped and pinched my neck--the pain of that was worse than dying, apparently.|hang
'I cannot even hang myself right.|hang
Basically I was going to jump off a bridge but the Samaritans talked me into not doing it from a payphone, half way through I ran out of money, but they gave me the free to call from payphones number like a second before the money ran out and I talked to a second person.|jump
I tried to cut my wrists twice as hard as I could.|cut
I do not know why, but that knife could pierce my skin.|cut
I tried to drink myself to death.|alcohol
I woke up in my suit on the couch the next day still drunk at 5pm feeling like shit and confused.|alcohol
I checked my phone and say that lots of friends were both concerned and giving me shit for getting that drunk.|alcohol
I tested and swung on the rope, then I hung myself from a tree in my back yard.|hang
I woke up at the bottom of the hill with the rope tightly around my neck, gasping for breath.|hang
The knot that I tied was stuck, and closing my airway.|hang
The first thing I did was go inside, to my mother, and point to the rope around my neck.|hang
I tried to overdose on Depakote.|drug
It had already been awhile since I took them, and I told the nurses at the ER that I had taken like, ten instead of the actual forty to sixty pills that were in my system.|drug
A quick blood analysis showed that I was like, dead.|bleed
"'""3rd though: '""I am going to flunk that paper due today'""Shitty OD attempt while manic, had not slept for 3 days and was fucked up on klonopin."|drug
Self-harmed a bunch and then downed a few bottles of pills with liquor.|drug|alcohol
Turns out my shitty suicide research saved my life; the two drugs I had taken the most of nullified each others'' effects on my heart.|drug
The last time I tried I was intent on hanging myself(emulating Robin I think) so I fashioned a noose and put the end of it over the door and closed it.|hang
Wrapped the noose around my neck and just let my legs go limp.|hang
well...a little bit more than a year ago, I think it was mid-february (2015), I tried to hang myself at home.|hang
the gym had basically everything: a bench, squat stands, a barbell, three pairs of dumbbells, a jumping rope, a friggin' homemade punching bag!|hang|jump
I sat on the bench, took the jumping rope, set up a slipknot on the pullup-bar, stepped on the bench, arranged the noose around my neck, and put my feet off the bench.|hang|jump
instinctively, my hands gripped the rope.|hang
there is one particular feeling I will always remember:the fabric of the rope.|hang
maybe the realization that it was a shame to waste a life in such a useless and pointless way, the realization that if the fabric of the rope was so beautiful, what could be said about a human being, the very expression of nature's (and maybe the entire universe's) fathomless power?|hang
I untied the knot, took a looooong breath, the longest of my whole life.|hang
Tylenol, aleve maybe benadryl but I do not really remember.|drug
Except that time with the pills, I just keep throwing up and laying there.|drug
I was laying in the bath tub in my underwear, (I wanted to at least have those on when someone found me) and I was practically bathing in my own blood.|bleed
Late to the party but oh well,I tried to overdose on a trip to Thailand last year.|drug
I got drunk on the room tab, went down to the street and bought some drugs from the shifty little pop-up stores that appear at night, and took them on my way back to the hotel, washed them down with vodka and a little mixer to make sure I would not throw up.|drug|alcohol
I cut myself as well that evening, as well as writing to my best friend before I fell asleep.|cut
The drugs had made me incredibly sleepy and my head felt so heavy I could barely move.|drug
I had thrown a belt over the door and looped it on to the handle closed the door and hung myself.|hang
I hung for just a moment long enough to pass out.|hang
"I have always wondered if he instantly regretted it or not, especially since I know he probably had a few moments before he lost consciousness [Details (trigger warning)](/s 'He hung himself from a tree and basically strangled himself since it was not a snap-your-neck hanging; then taken off of life support after there was no brain activity detected after being in the hospital a few days'"")."|hang
"This may be the first time that I have gone past being '""teary-eyed'"" at a Reddit post and arrived at full-on tears."|cut
"'There goes my favorite tie.'"""""|hang
The first time I tried to kill myself was ODing on pills.|drug
But this time on sleeping pills.|drug
I took 50 sleeping pills (2400mg).|drug
And 50 pills was considered attempt suicide.|drug
So I took the pills and was on the brink of death and I knew it.|drug
When I was sixteen I wanted to kill myself, so I took a bunch of sleeping pills, locked my bedroom door and drifted off.|drug
So I checked the packaging of the pills I took the night before.|drug
"'I need help...'""I had been dealing with a ton of bullying (because of my weight), had been very pubicly cheated on, and my ptsd (from sexual abuse) was rearing its ugly head."|disease
I had not taken enough pills, I did not cut deep enough, I could not hold myself underwater long enough, and I was a minor, so I could not get my hands on alcohol.|cut|alcohol|drug|drown
 I tried to hang myself from a closet clothing bar with a belt tied into a tight loop.|hang
I hung long enough to lose consciousness, but the bar must have snapped because the next thing I remember I had fallen out of the closet and my clothing was literally everywhere.|hang
"'""Alcohol and pills."|drug|alcohol
I was 17 and took 28 Prozac pills (it was all I had left).|drug
I told my therapist later on and he said that Prozac is too safe to overdose on.|drug
Alcohol and xanax make for a pretty forgettable night, but the next morning I resolved to tell my parents (I was 16 at the time) and get help.|drug|alcohol
I wrapped my head in a bed sheet and held a gun to my head.|gun
16 year old me had severe emotional issues and was on a ridiculous amount of bipolar, depression, and antipsychotic medications.|drug
One particular day, I was walking home with thoughts flooding my brain, normal high school drama shit, family turmoil, various other things.|drown
I overdosed on all my medications.|drug
A 13 year old girl who stole her grandma''s car, a seven year old who physically attacked her mom, biting, kicking, and most sad of all, a 5 year old boy who had tried to hang himself from a ceiling fan.|hang
I finished my program, took my pills, tried to be happy.|drug
I decided that day to stop taking my medications.|drug
So, I had spent years on all kinds of medications that I knew were fucking me up, and they turned out to be completely unnecessary.|drug
This year, I am hoping to find medications that actually do something helpful for me.|drug
I tried to OD & my husband who had been asleep caught & stopped me.|drug
I was just taking pill after pill and knew that this was it, the end.|drug
seriously do not try to overdose.|drug
I woke up in the hospital after overdosing.|drug
At one point before I blacked out, the nurses were trying to force me to drink liquid charcoal to absorb the pills I took, because some of them shut down my gag reflex.|drug|alcohol
Next time I am drinking bleach.|alcohol

I swallowed pills and laid down waiting to drift into my eternal slumber.|drug
"'I should not have chickened out'""I have bipolar disorder, and I got really fucking sick of insane mania and crippling depression."|disease
So, Injected myself with an entire bottle of insulin, and took a sleeping pill.|drug
The next like 2 or 3 days I was in the ICU having my blood sugar tested every half hour or hour or something, and getting injected with sugar and forced to eat sugar.|bleed
I tried to slit my wrists in my dorm room but a friend walked in shortly after.|cut
I was light headed and actually kinda giddy from blood loss but my first thought when I realized my friend was not going to let me bleed out was ' damn.|bleed
I took every pill I could find, including tons of benadryl so I could pass out and never wake up.|drug
Those days were incredibly painful, not just because of the after effects of the pills metabolizing in my body.|drug
The next time I tried, I cut my legs fairly deep, and took even more pills than I had before.|cut|drug
A year had passed since last time, and this time I took a whole bottle of Ibuprofen, sleeping pills, and every pill I could possibly find (again).|drug
When I tried to kill myself I took multiple handfuls of pills.|drug
Then I drank till I could not stand up, laid in the shower puking and cutting.|alcohol
I ended with a double digit blood alcohol level and almost lost my liver from the toxicity of the iron and alcohol.|bleed|alcohol
I thought all those pills I swallowed would end me and they did not.|drug
It's still unpredictable, my mental illness (which by the way, turned out to be co-morbid with Borderline Personality Disorder as well) is never going to go away, and I need to address incidents of the past in therapy...but I am truly feeling as if I can forgive the past for hurting me so much and move on and look at the present more.|disease
When I woke up from overdosing on every pill I had in the house (I created an overdose basket and put it under my sink in preparation for another low), I felt angry that my mother was in the same room because we did not have a relationship at that time and I did not understand why she was there.|drug
I tried to overdose again but just fell asleep and woke up much later.|drug
When I was about 16 I decided to take every pill in the house.|drug
Some 75 advil, a package of dramamine and a blister pack full of little red pills, I should have chugged the drano under the sink instead.|drug
There is always an assumption that it will be a drunk person but we checked it out anyway and he had fastened a cord around his neck and was clearly asphyxiating.|hang|alcohol
I tried to remove the cord while my friend phoned an ambulance but it was digging deep into his neck so I cut it off with a penknife.|cut|hang
As he came to he started fighting me, he really did not want the cord taking off.|hang
When he slowly started to come around properly he tried to get up and run away but could not stand and I had to gently restrain him (he was so weak a hand on the shoulder was enough).|hang
I find happiness when I drink and i needed some that night.|alcohol
I told myself I am just gonna drink as much as possible because i do not care what can happen.|alcohol
I took 97, 50 mg sleeping pills.|drug
Two years ago I was really drunk and high and ran into the middle of a street right around a curve.|alcohol
Inside the house I went to the bathroom and cut myself all over my arm and fell asleep.|cut
Well I got really drunk and took some pills like a lot at least looking back it seemed like a lot then I woke up, and well was in disbelief and a lot of pain, then I had to hide it so no one would know what happened and I went horse back riding a little more than an hour later.|drug|alcohol
I stole two bottles of pills from my dad's cabinet, and after 5th period at school that day, I swallowed them all.|drug
I was a very belligerent drunk.|alcohol

Long story short, I had a mental breakdown with my parents about my behavior and the twisted thoughts that plagued my mind.|disease
I was checked into the hospital and was placed in the mental ward for suicide watch and to monitor my alcohol level.|alcohol
I had my blood drawn every four hours and had my vitals tested every two hours.|bleed
"I still struggle with ptsd and depression, but with the help of marijuana I am able to get some sleep without being plagued my nightmares."""|disease|drug
He realized what happened and instead of being angry, was relieved and decided he wanted to live rather than his mom come home and find his body in a pool of blood.|bleed
He cleared the squibbed round, cleaned the gun and called a doctor.|gun
I never told him, but I shoot guns and have since I was a young kid and I have seen or shot hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition and it was not until this past August that I saw a round squib.|gun
I should have just drank some robitussin instead.|alcohol
I was not a complete loner, I had friends that I would socialize with and hang out with, but none of them knew how I was truly feeling.|hang
I stopped hanging out, I stopped going out to parties.|hang
I attempted to kill myself by using a knife and cutting open my stomach.|cut
I am guessing whereever I stabbed did not cause enough damage to actually kill me or make me faint from blood loss and just die from lack of blood.|bleed
They found me in my bathroom covered in blood still shouting the same thing over and over and called an ambulance.|bleed
Every single one of them died from car accidents within a three year span, all in the same general area, all due to high speed leading to fishtailing.|vehicle

Never shared the full story with anyone, but here goes:In 2012 I was diagnosed with a neuro-degenerative illness and was told there are only a few dozen active recorded cases, and in past cases some patients have gotten something called [Morvan's Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morvan%27s_syndrome) which leads to fatal insomnia.|disease
I was hospitalized for a month because my lung function was severely affected by the illness for a short time and I developed dementia and what appeared to be hallucinations (I do not remember most of my time at the hospital).|disease
I was also given a drug called oxcarbazapine to help with the muscle issues.|drug
When I got there I met my friend at the door and then slowly began talking to other people as they talked to me, and then I introduced myself by name to one guy and he laughed and said he knew who I was, and that we had all hung out together the weekend before...|hang
Sleep deprived, confused, and angry I walked back to my house and downed ALL of my pills.|drug
They took me to the hospital, and started to give me some sludge stuff to drink that was supposed to keep me from absorbing much more... it was awful, and I was vomiting and aspirating a bit more, and I told them to stop.|alcohol
And the nurses kept doing it, but a doctor came in and told them to stop because the drug I had taken was not very potent in overdoses and because he did not think pumping my stomach would help because I would be okay.|drug
He said he had spoken to someone about the oxcarbazapine drug I was taking, and that person told him that a very very small percentage of people taking it start sleepwalking.|drug
It's been 4 years now, and while I still have major issues with the neurodegenerative illness, I have never had sleepwalking problems again since stopping my prescription for the drug.|disease|drug
I took sixteen pills of 50 mg Sertraline, four pills of 0.5 mg Lorazepam (Ativan), a can of redbull, a bottle of prescription cough medicine (Codeine), and alcohol.|drug|alcohol

I remembered hearing about someone killing themselves by taking pills.|drug
I did not know what kind of pills would work.|drug
I assumed any pills.|drug
We had those paper Dixie cups for rinsing your mouth out while you were brushing your teeth and I filled one up with water and opened the bottle and just started swallowing pills.|drug
So I started messing around with the makeup bag on the counter so she would not be able to hear me putting the remaining pills back in the bottle.|drug
It was a Fentanyl overdose.|drug
I noticed my breathing and the fact that after enough of an opiate, to overdose, you do not  feel much of anything at all.|drug
To be honest I am not sure quite how serious i was, or how much i was just looking for attention, but i took a good 2000mg of ibuprofen after drinking a good amount.|alcohol

The final try ended up with me trying to drink myself to death.|alcohol

 Something minor had set me off, probably something girl related (my girlfriend at the time was also severely depressed, loved her to death, and we helped each other at times but overall we were just straight bad for one another) So I decided that it was not worth everything, I decided to sneak out and hang myself in the middle of the night (I had a fixation with this way as the summer prior my best friend hung himself, and I was not smart enough for the right pills)  The thing that changed my mind was remembering that friends mom at his funeral service.|hang|drug

Over the period of roughly three months I had been prescribed four different medications for back pain, and after enough mornings in pain and misery and watching as the marriage I had just gotten into crumble around me, I decided to end it.|drug
Two of the prescriptions I was allergic to, and all told I had somewhere near eighty pills to swallow, so I set out to end it in a numb mess.|drug
I went down to a vending machine, slapped in enough money to get about eight Monsters, and just sat around the corner of the building trading back and forth between chugging Monster and throwing back pills.|drug
All told it was maybe two minutes that it took me to slam the medication down, so I figured one last smoke was reasonable.|drug
It took a lot more trauma, a touch of booze, and a lot of nights spent crying over my past opportunities , but in time I came to realize that it was possible to be fine again.|alcohol
I do not consider this an actual suicide attempt because I backed down and did not jerk the wheel but I think it is a little different than most stories maybe so I might as well share.|hang
My little car started picking up speed and struggling but I heard it rev harder than I had ever before.|vehicle
My hands were shaking and I was desperately trying to build up the strength to jerk the wheel.|hang

The second time I tried to choke myself with 550 cord.|hang
I was in full survival mode trying to get the cord off.|hang

I have not been to a church service but a few times a year I sit on the steps of a church nearby and have a couple drinks and just talk shit out.|alcohol
When I was 15, I tried to strangle myself with my football belt.|hang

I tried hanging myself last year at about this time.|hang
I tried using real rope and everything too, but the branch I was using had some serious rot on the inside, despite looking sturdy.|hang
I knew I was not going to succeed when my brother walked down stairs to find me laying on the ground bleeding from the neck with a knife in my hand.|bleed
About two weeks ago I tried to end myself with rubbing alcohol, and needless to say it was not at all fun.|alcohol
All of this happened outside my house really late at night, and the alcohol part of it kicked in nigh instantly because it was only ten minutes later that I was wandering my small town without enough clothes on for the weather hoping I would freeze to death or pass out and not wake up, but it never ended up happening, and because of my regret I managed to get on the phone with a friend, and I ended up throwing the bottle of rubbing alcohol as far from myself as possible and going back home.|alcohol
The following days were mostly spent nursing a hangover filled with regret and some self beating on for what I would done, but I came out of it realizing it was an impulse act fuelled by my mild depression and suicidal thoughts, as I would found the rubbing alcohol not even three hours before I attempted suicide with it.|alcohol
When I tried to hang myself junior year of HS I thought that would be the solution to all my issues.|hang
So, while it was a battle and still is a battle this very day, I focused my life on a career of entertainment, specifically comedy, because I want to tell stories that make people laugh and also understand mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety.|disease
I am not sure I was conscious enough yet, all I remember is realizing how warm my chest felt before I put my cold fingers to my favorite T shirt to feel the blood.|bleed
I had just fallen 12 feet and the blood from my head had ran down most of my body, pooling around me in a ravine that I thought was deeper than it was before I jumped.|bleed|jump
Once I realized it was blood I was pissed about my shirt being ruined.|bleed
"'Fuck, I cannot move my legs'""    I woke up after taking a handful of Tylenol and Klonopin."|drug

I tried to massage them to get blood flowing but I was sitting for about an hour without even feeling them.|bleed
It was not easy, and although I have a beautiful family, a stable job, finances under control, and do not abuse drugs I still get a random bought of depression.|drug
Instead of focusing on the grief of loosing a loved one I tried to self medicate with drugs (both prescribed by my therapist and street).|drug
That of course did not help and I intentionally overdosed.|drug
My Mom killed herself with an overdose of drugs.|drug
2 shots of heroine, 4 Xanax, 4 OxyContins.|drug

I am still fighting depression to this day even with drugs and therapy.|drug

My mom was concerned about me, sent a neighbor to look for me, and they just happened to see my vehicle while driving around the neighborhood.|vehicle

I cried and cried and held a knife, just shaking and trying to work up the courage to slit my throat like a beautiful smile.|cut
My depression does not make me sad, it makes me angry for no reason, and I mean anger like I caught someone fucking my own mother after drugging her after a turn with my sister's.|drug
I fight my depression by making myself sad, listening to music I know will trigger me and thinking about the day I found out my son's mother cut her own throat the way I was about to my own (two years later I found out, it broke me).|cut
I know it is hard, im in tears writing this out.|cut

I would been taking alot of pills over the week and it had a really bad effect.|drug
My parents thought I was taking illegal drugs and had my uncle search my room where I knew he would find the empty packets of pills.|drug
Scenarios I dismissed: hanging, because people do not look just peacefully asleep after that; cliff-jumping, because of the possibility of washing up on a shore or landing on rocks and having children find me; train/bus, because including someone else in the trauma would be cruel.|hang

I got it into my head that overdosing on levothyroxine was viable, so I took all of the levothyroxine in my apartment (it was something like 10-20 mg).|drug
A few hours later, I called poison control, realized I needed to get help, and called 911 from a bus stop.|drug
I may have been wrong there--though I stayed off of Levothyroxine for a while, I had to take a beta blocker for several weeks to deal with the side effects of the levothyroxine overdose.|drug
In retrospect, I cannot help thinking that I probably made my thyroid cancer worse with that overdose (I have had 2 surgeries since then).|drug

"Another issue is that lack of medication can directly cause depression and a host of other 'lethargic'"" style symptoms."|drug
That means that the chronic illness that allows that situation can only be improved by reducing the depression.|disease
I remember being super depressed, I tied a shoe lace to my closet hanger where you hang your clothes and I made a loop and put it around my neck and I just dropped nearly broke the thing and I decided to get up.|hang
I still get depressed but I use music to calm me down and occasionally self medicate with cannabis.|drug

About 30 or so seconds underwater (like I said, I was not actually intending to die rather than go along with it, so I was not really in a rush to drown), I started getting pulled by some random bloke who happened to see me and my sister (she was being helped by my dad, who had a really bad back from an incident in the army).|drown
I tried overdosing meds at 16: my parents were out of town and I was just looking for a way to do it that had the least chances to leave me paralyzed if it did not go as planned, so I went for my mother''s hypertension medication.|drug
I swallowed a box, some sleeping pills and vodka, and went to sleep.|drug

Pulled the trigger but for some reason it did not fire, I ended up dropping the gun, texting my mom to come pick me up and to check me into a hospital.|gun
I am glad that the gun malfunctioned, and I am glad to still be here today even though I still have days where I wish things were different, and I am slowly changing them for the better.|gun
The other hard part was when my dad would call me at the psych ward before the visitor hours were over just to talk to me for a little bit, I broke down in tears every single time just because I would hear his voice and feel safe, that maybe everything will ultimately work out in the long run.|cut
There was no real coherent thought I broke down crying, pulled the magazine out of my rifle and cleared the double feed.|gun
Then broke the rifle down and started cleaning the bolt housing group and fell asleep with the pieces in my lap|gun

Permanently some motor function in one of my hands because of it as well as various other weird nerve damage because of the pills and amount I took.|drug
I do not so much anymore, especially after finally being giving the right pills at the right dosage for psychotic depression.|drug
Anyway, if you are that very rare person who somehow is going through the exact thing I was going through- 1. its much worse to be suicidal and too afraid to do it because of what you experienced last time (literal, true hell, the hallucinations gave me a panic disorder and sparked off serious psychotic symptoms in my day-to-day life).|disease

Last memory was on the bathroom floor, drunk, in a last moment of regret I tried, and failed, to vomit up the pills.|drug|alcohol
None of my roommates mentioned anything, but they must have found me and carried me to my bed thinking I had just been too drunk.|alcohol
I took 34 paracetamol tablets, had a glass of orange juice, and went to bed hoping to not wake up around about 10pm, of course I did not realize at the time how long and painful death by liver failure is, I woke up around 6am with what I can only describe as the worst pain I had ever felt in my abdomen, I stumbled to the toilet and proceed to vomit for the next hour, I woke my parents up due to the vomiting and they demanded to know what was up because I was puking not sick but bright yellow bile, I told them the truth and I was ashamed, I felt relief I guess that all my bottled feelings were out in the open, it was just after a rough breakup and my life just kept tumbling down hill, this was in November 2015 when I attempted it, I spent the next week and a half on an infusion and vomiting any food or drink straight back up after an hour, that beeping noise is one I will never get out my head, to say the least the whole experience was trans-formative for me, I had a week on a ward to think about life and where I went from there, ontop of that for the first time in a long time I no longer felt alone, my friends and family came in to rally around me and pick me up from the dirt and bring me in from the cold, then just after christmas I met a wonderful new girlfriend and I never knew life could get this good, things have turned around, to anyone whose thinking about it, reach out to those around you, they are not your enemies they can help!|alcohol
Multiple attempts on my own life, I cannot even count the number of times I have sat with a razor to my wrist or my neck in a noose.|hang
I have tried hanging myself, overdosing, alcohol poisoning, falling from some height, stepping into traffic....|hang|drug|alcohol
Damnit why did not this just work I suck at overdosing.|drug
I tried to overdose.|drug
Once when I was 15, I tried to hang myself by tying myself to a tree.|hang
Another time I tried to jump off a bridge but same thing happened.|jump
The time I came closest was with pills.|drug
I took 2 whole bottles of Tylenol and Xanax and tried to go to sleep and not wake up again.|drug
It took about 5 minutes for me to realize that this was a bad idea, not only because killing myself would be a terrible loss but because ODing on pain pills is, ironically, an excruciatingly painful way to die.|drug
About 20 years ago I took a bottle of aspirins, bottle of advil, and some cold medicine.|drug
When I was a sophmore in high school I overdosed between midnight and 3am.|drug
They ended up shoving a tube down my nose, which bled like crazy.|bleed
I had been drugged pretty bad, aside from the pills and whine I took they must have given me more sedatives and I had slept for an entire day.|drug
Should have used a much thicker cable|hang
a few years ago i took a lot of drugs and drank heavily, and then i jumped off a bridge.|drug|alcohol|jump
Because of the chronic pain I was in, I had a prescription for Tylenol 3s, a whole bottle of them.|drug
The pills were on the shelf.|drug
He had aome kind of mental illness,not depression.|disease
I was there for the second one, he had tried to hang himself.|hang
I do not have too many details, sonce my father dose not like to talk about it.|drug
But I also did not care much because I was still really groggy and really high on the pills I would taken.|drug
Turns out what I would taken was not easy to OD on and they kept me fairly alert on the trip.|drug
Worst thing I have ever had to drink and it left my stomach fucked up for days.|alcohol
"'oh, I am still alive'""i woke up to my father yelling about missing medication."|drug
of course i took both of my father''s medication bottles, one was pain killers the other was muscle relaxants(?)|drug
"'"", after waking up from an attempted aspirin OD (yeah, I was that dumb)."""|drug
He tried to hang himself a couple years ago when my dad passed away suddenly.|hang
I drowned once, at 17, too- I know what death is like, I can wait.|drown
Tried the pills and suffocation method|suffocate|drug
1st time was oh ok I am kinda glad 2nd time was shit I feel sick 3rd time was I was too cowardly to stay in front of that train4th time was fuck you for pulling me back at the last second 5th time was ow my neck hurts6th time was hmm I guess I should stop doing this 7th time was omfg I have failed again even though I took so so many pills and now I cannot stand up because nerve damage and the world is spinning clockwise|drug|vehicle
I must have woken up in the wee hours because there was nobody else around (after trying to OD) and I was a bit affected by the drugs - I was just walking around the house confused and thought I might have become a ghost.|drug
I tried choking myself to death with an electrical cord.|hang
There was no where for me to hang myself and i know if i tried asphyxiation, i could relax when i passed out and survive.|hang
He tried killing me with an electrical cord (long story about the agreement) and i just remember waking up, he was still there, and it took forever to come to.|hang
When he realized i was still breathing i heard him calling my name and i just started crying, mixed emotions of relief, sadness, failure, just a lot of mixed emotions, every time i tried (pills, gun to my temple, femoral artery).|drug|gun
I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.|disease
I am on auxiliary medication and go through intense therapy.|drug
My fiancée and I had been struggling with a lot of debt, plus we both have severe depression and anxiety disorders.|disease
While she was there the pressure from feeling like I was a failure for not being able to alleviate her pain, being in a new state with no family or friends to support me, as well as all the stress from hiding the fact that I am bisexual from everyone I Know for most of my life hit a boiling point and I cut my arms pretty bad.|cut
"'""I drank 708 ml of Nyquil as fast as I could and then popped a whole bottle of Tylenol PM and laid in bed just trying to let it happen."|drug|alcohol
Its almost as if I was concentrating so hard on dying after drinking all the Nyquil and taking all the Tylenol that I just went numb and couldnt hear anything other than my thoughts; I couldnt hear my mom banging on my door to my bedroom and screaming at me to open the door.|drug|alcohol
I guess I just woke up like usual feeling a bit sick and then was like fuck I overdosed last night that is why I feel sick.|drug
)I could not tell you if I wanted to be saved after I took all those pills or not.|drug
I decided to jump off the 9th floor later that day (where I lived back then).|jump
I always pondered on suicide since I moved to Spain, sitting on the window ledge contemplating if I would feel relief by jumping.|jump
"I was going to try again soon after, when my sister would go off to a camp or event of some sort but my parents 'fixed'"" the window so I could not open it and attempt to jump again."|jump
"TL;DR: My first conscious thought was to try to jump again from the 9th floor but not in front of my sister"""|jump
"'Ugh, not again...'"" as I wake up to paramedics stripping me down after administering Narcan (I attempted to overdose on a combination of heroin, xanax and alcohol)."""|drug|alcohol
It''s hard to pin down exactly what my first thought was because I still had Xanax in my system for about two days afterwards, so I was kind of all an emotional mess even once I was fully conscious .|drug
about 2 years ago tried xanax, blood pressure meds and helium bagwoke up a day later and cried.still crying today|bleed|drug
She cut her self ect...|cut
She claimed to have fallen in love with me, and if I did not love her back, she would swallow as many pills that she could find.|drug
'Took me a while to remember I would overdosed, my stomach hurt so bad I thought I had appendicitis|drug
I swallowed every damn pill I owned (a wide variety due to being medicated for bipolar, depression, anxiety and a few other random meds) but a friend found me slumped against a basement wall covered in my own vomit.|drug
I thought surely nobody on this planet was drowning in pain and misery the way I was.|drown
After a stint In a mental hospital for the suicide, pill problem and eating disorder I spent months trying to win my mom back.|disease|drug
I lapsed a few times with the pill problem and the eating disorder but that was it for me, I was done with trying to be done with life.|disease|drug
Unfortunately she passed away while I was still battling the eating disorder, but she did know I was on the final road to recovery.|disease
I had knocked back a few shots of gin, taken almost two dozen vicodin, and then chugged another pint of straight gin.|drug
There was no joy at being alive, no gratitude that I did not drown in vomit, no excitement at a second chance; I woke up face down in a pool of puke with one of the worst hangovers of my life and the knowledge that not only did I feel like a total failure at life, I was enough of one that I I could not even opt out.|drown
At age 19 one feb or mars night i decided to hang myself.|hang
Tied a cord into a noose, put it over a door and closed it, i hade a pair of wireless headphones on repeating a certain song.|hang
I kind of crouched down on the chair enough for the cord to cut blood flow to my head.|cut|bleed|hang
Looking at the cord and door i could see that it most likely had been damaged from the friction caused between cord and edge of the door when my body went into spasms.|hang
Went to my shed and grabbed my dads thickest rope looked for ways to hang all over the house until I finally settled on the ceiling fan structure in my room.|hang
Probably looped the rope around 4 times until there was just enough to fit my head/neck inside.|hang
I kept repeating to myself its supposed to hurt  I do not know how long I initially hung there until I decided I did not want to do it anymore.|hang
I ended up scratching the rope so badly my nails chipped off at the base and everything went blurry, not black i just could not see or hear.|hang
I was dehydrated, sleep deprived, had not eaten in days, and had a lot of pills.|drug
When I was 16, I slit my wrists.|cut
I did not work out so 6 weeks later I OD''d on medications and spent a couple days in ICU.|drug
I woke up after my attempted overdose and could not tell if I was still alive or not.|drug
Then when my parents showed up and started screaming at him and ripping into me, I remember just desperately wanting to leave the hospital and wanting them out of my room.|cut
"All I could think for the 12 hours before they moved me to a real psych ward was, 'if I had not taken those fucking pills, I would be curled up in my boyfriend''s arms right now instead of in a 6''x8'' whitewashed room with no sheets or pillows and Nick Jr on the TV while listening to some girl shrieking and running down the halls outside my door'""Never again."|drug
"Followed by '""I cannot hear anything, work is going to be a nightmare'"" (side effect of the meds I took was thinned blood, and if your blood is below a certain consistency, apparently you will not be able to hear until it thickens back up, who knew)."|bleed
"I can almost feel the gun barrel in my mouth and my finger on the trigger."""|gun
I had taken a LOT of pills.|drug
It was only a sedative.|drug
Turns out zip ties.|hang
Just managed to cut it off.|cut
Also got scared at how well a belt in a closed door works.|hang
"Failed by slicing my arm the 'wrong'"" way."|cut
The arm is completely destroyed by scars varying from a couple of millimeters up to 2 cm wide cuts.|cut
I quit going to classes, hanging out with friends, I quit doing really anything other than drinking, eating and playing video games.|hang|alcohol
I decided to kill myself by overdosing on Insulin.|drug
So I poured out a 1/5th of whiskey down the drain of sink in the bathroom and put it on the floor next to my bed.|alcohol
It would make it look like I would just gotten drunk and tried to take my insulin and in my stupor used too much.|alcohol
I have been living with depression for 15 years, and when I get stressed out or if my blood sugar gets out of whack, it gets worse, but I have resolved myself to talk to someone when that happens, rather than trying to handle it on my own.|bleed
I was fifteen the first time I tried to overdose.|drug
I took a bunch of pills and of course, threw them back up.|drug
"'""When I was seventeen I was pretty fucked up, I was addicted to pills and afraid of living."|drug
My boyfriend had overdosed and died when I was 16, and it fucked me up bad.|drug
I tried to overdose again.|drug
I still suffer from some residual PTSD and anxiety which I finally decided that I needed to take - I fought it for a long time.|disease
Feel like I am being treated unfairly and it is causing me a lot of stress, even with my medication.|drug
"She thought I was just drunk."""|alcohol
"'I think its time to give sobriety an honest try'"" was my first thought waking up in the ICU with my parents crying over me after taking a bunch of tricylic antidepressants when the drugs stopped giving me any euphoria."|drug
I was 11 years old, and I had tried jumping in front of a car.|jump
and kinda Just stuck to cutting.|cut
The last time, I remember I drank a shit load of Jack Daniels and hoped it would be enough to Kill me in my sleep.|alcohol
At that time I had a pretty good alcohol problem going on and nothing seemed to be working, I made meetings,  I saw a therapist but nothing was fixing that deep down I just wanted to die and alcohol was not solving that feeling anymore.|alcohol
Tho,  I remember this from that movie about David Foster Wallace that I have been infected by this American idea that somehow some grand gesture will cure me.|disease
I tried to hang myself a few years  ago.|hang
Obviously it failed, because I used a tie and it ripped.|cut|hang
I was on new meds for my bipolar disorder.|disease
I went to the local supermarket and got strong sleeping pills.|drug
I am able to feel more, care more, do better things, lose weight, eat healthier, and kick my habitual drinKing into occasional drinking.|alcohol
I thank her for that, and now that I have happiness, I am glad my soul is still contained in this plane of existence because the world needs me, and I need it.|vehicle
Hang in there :)|hang
My first thoughts were very unclear because I was still under the influence of several hundred pills - including a month's worth of Ambien.|drug
So coming back home to my conservative catholic family...piled on top of years of untreated mental illness and the creeping fear that I would never be a good enough adult.|disease
So, I looked up every possible way to die, then decided the easiest would be hanging.|hang
Luckily, there was not any fucking rope.|hang
What I did have was some really strong thickish string that I just tied into a noose and prayed would last long enough.|hang
I remember finally working up the nerve to jump off of the chair, then clawing at the shelves I tied myself to.|hang|jump
I was on the ground at this point, the rope had broke.|hang
I managed to worm my fingers between the swollen skin of my neck and the broken noose, and ripped it off of me.|cut|hang
"Ineffectively attempted to overdose nightly for 9 months...Literally the only thought that ever came was 'shit, guess ill try again tonight'"""""|drug
However it did show me that someone did care, I messaged another girl I was close to basically crying out after I had overdosed.|drug
However I never forgave my stepdad who never knew about my overdose but when he discovered I was off work called me selfish and never spoke to me for days.|drug
I have tried hanging, myself during life.|hang
It carrie on until I decided to hang myself when my mother caught me getting ready for my death.|hang
"This time I decided 'I am going to drink bleach and try that.'"""|alcohol
I never did it, but I tried cutting one of my ears off then killing myself, by self inflicted knife wound.|cut
I got out some rope , tied it to the ceiling braces in the basement, stood on a chair and hung myself.|hang
The noose was still intact and tied to the beam, and I was confused as hell and terrified.|hang
I had lunged for the gun involved and was tackled by my neighbor before I could grab it.|gun
"as soon as i cut myself, i basically looked down and immediately was like 'what the fuck did i just do,  mom (who was right there) call 911 i think I am dying'""."|cut
I tried to OD and a friend found me.|drug
In my mind, I was going to put my head on the table and cut my neck like a guillotine.|cut
I spent weeks looking up a way to kill myself with the dozens of pills that were prescribed to me at the time.|drug
I was fifteen and had just been told I have defective genes, HLA-B27 to be exact, and was due to suffer from every chronic illness my mother had.|disease
Was admitted into a mental hospital the night before for overdosing on half a bottle of zoloft(?|drug
I guess I vomited up the pills, and passed out from the alcohol.|drug|alcohol
Many more, myself included, are largely unaware how debilitating certain conditions or disorders can be for the individual experiencing them.|disease
The first time I had taken roughly 120 OTC pills (generic sleep aids, tylenol, advil combo) and realized 'OH FUCK HOW IS MY SISTER GOING TO BE.|drug
The second time, I took roughly 100 pills over the course of two days.|drug
So I found a rope in my dads tool shed, went into the woods, and tried to hang myself from a tree.|hang
The rope was old, so it snapped from rubbing on the bark.|hang
I woke up in a hospital bed at the psych ward after overdosing on sleep medications confused and groggy.|drug
There was just so much going on and I was only operating with 3 hrs of sleep for going on 5 days straight along with constantly changing medications by my doctor to find the right concotion for me.|drug
The medication they put me on really impaired my judgement.|drug
I tried with pills, but about 15 minutes afterwards I could not stop thinking about my family members.|drug
Twice by overdosing on prescription sleeping pills, once I almost managed to walk myself off of a cliff, and the final time I seriously considered to hang myself but did not have anything to do it with.|hang|drug
My first and only real suicide attempt i tried to overdose on a cocktail mixture of prescription anxiety and pain killers as well as over the counter at age 15.|drug
That day i overdosed but did not die.|drug
I had swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills and drank a bottle of expensive wine.|drug|alcohol
I spent a week in the psych ward so doped up that I did not really think of anything.|drug
My first attempt I put a loaded gun from my stepdads closet in my mouth and my friend called and asked if I wanted to go bowling, made me realize I did not want to die.|gun
On my second attempt I tried to OD.|drug
I went home, grabbed an assload of pills (fuckin Tylenol....|drug
"My mom came in and saw 'the set-up'"" and instantly realized what I attempted to do and called poison control."|drug
When I was 14 I tried to slit my wrists with a piece of broken glass.|cut
I sawed into my wrist with tears and fury and sat there behind my Jr high school in an alley waiting to die.|cut
I was bleeding but nothing life threatening apparently.|bleed
Years later I was the one who had to sit in my brothers apartment with clorox wipes and rags cleaning his belongings so they could be removed after his shotgun suicide.|gun
We could not afford to have someone else do it, I hung sheets on the walls so I did not have to look at the mess and put towels on the globs of brain matter and skull fragments that sat in piles on the floor next to me, since the sofa was where he sat and it was dripping with his remnants.|hang
As I went around cleaning I saw what I thought were fillings from teeth but turned out to be the pellets from the shotgun that had lodged into the drywall and fallen out coated in white powder.|gun
I drank a liter of vodka, looked up the lethal dose of benadryl, took that, took a bunch of xanax, percoset, and ambien all mixed together.|drug|alcohol
I was hoping the cocktail of pills and alcohol would kill me and here I am being scared out of my mind.|drug|alcohol
Also, I was extremely thirsty because of the bottles of benadryl I took.|drug
Since then, I got help, started a medication, and had a lot of therapy/counseling.|drug
Edit: I found out the reason I did not die that night is because I am a super processor for several pain killers and different pills.|drug
Tried driving myself into the wall at high speeds away from public while intoxicated.|vehicle
I cant drive a stick shift while drunk.|alcohol
Got anti depression medications and while its not as bad as it used to be, I am on a bit of a time limit.|drug
I snuck past my mom while she was napping on the couch and filled a plastic bag with headache pills and then some other type (cannot remember what).|drug
I called my best friend and started getting loopy, walking around the neighborhood and dropping pills behind me.|drug
My friend convinced me to go back to my house and try to throw up the pills.|drug
That I am too much of a pussy to go out in terrible pain, so I have to wait until I can rent a gun.|gun
My mothers boyfriend at the time had an assortment of guns and I decided to break into his gun cabinet and load one.|gun
 I sat there with a gun to my head for about 10 minutes before I realized I would be doing more harm to my family rather than solving my issues.|gun
Tried with pills.|drug
Found out I had bi-polar and borderline personality disorders, along with the depression and anxiety.|disease
This particular night I went out drinking with my roommates during college.|alcohol
Went in my room, got my box cutter and started slashing myself.|cut
I never cut deep enough to hit an artery so I gave up.|cut
Down the road you get hooked on the feeling of the pain and its almost like drug.|drug
I had been suicidal for awhile before this happened, I spend most days planning how best to do it in the back of my mind, if I could get my hands on a gun or if I should cut myself.|cut|gun
I OD'd on celexa, trazodone and topomax.|drug
I woke up in the ambulance with blood ALL OVER ME, shivering and crying.|bleed
I did not remember calling 911 at all, I only remembered taking the pills and laying in bed.|drug
I was 17 and I overdosed on benzos.|drug
There was nothing around, so I stabbed myself in the wrists with a pencil, thinking it would pierce the vein and allow me to bleed out.|cut|bleed
I tried to take a bottle of pills once due to bullying and severe depression.|drug
Tapering off the methadone as of today next two months really going to test me once I am off but I have got things I have to work on before in off of it completely|drug
I had taken quite a bit of trazodone, but not as drastically as most pill stories I read.|drug
Apparently I was in a hotel room with vomit and blood around me|bleed
"'""I had hung myself and right after I had drifted off I suddenly took a quick breathe and I was wide awake again."|hang
I realized I had grabbed the rope and pulled myself up a little bit to allow me to take one small breathe.|hang
I then untied the rope and cried for a while before going to the hospital.|hang
I attempted by drug overdose so my body was still shut down.|drug
I was able to rip out my IV before a swarm of nurses came to hold me down.|cut
I tried to overdose and set messages up so that I would not be rotting...  took the pills and laid down.|drug
They were not actually handcuffs but more of a leather strap that tied my feet and wrists down to the bed.|hang
"The first thing I thought, aside from the confusion and disbelief of still breathing was both 'Godammit'"" and '""This is what you get for forgetting to clean the goddamned gun.'"""""|gun
I pulled trigger and the gun jammed.|gun
I have never 100% moved on from those darkest of days, and it is a constant battle keeping the negative thoughts restrained and at bay.|hang
I would get jumped by groups of them when walking home at night.|jump
Didn''t take enough pills.|drug
Didn''t tie the noose right.|hang
The plan was to overdose, and that is exactly what I did.|drug
I took a ton of pills late one evening, and then walked around behind the wood shed at home, sat myself under a big Norfolk pine and let my mind begin to close down.|drug
I did not really care that he would find pill bottles.|drug
Luckily my only attempt, but I did continue to cut myself for about 7 more years.|cut
But, I have managed to make it out from drowning in my own head without drugs or real therapy.|drug|drown
I realized that no one gave a shit if I lived or died as I spent almost three days out of it, puking my guts up only managing to stay alive because I ended up passing out on my side and did not drown in vomit.|drown
You're memory of events can trick you, especially with drugs, but in the darkness I felt something pushing me, trying to drown me and I could not breath but I was fighting it and did not have strength.|drug|drown
I was awake and talking to a doctor for half an hour before I touched my head and realized I had stitches all over and I had blood all over me.|bleed
Ive got tears in my eyes.|cut
"&nbsp;When I started vomiting blood and bile, all I could think was '""I really hope I am not throwing up the pills right now'""."|bleed|drug
When I woke up I was covered in blood (some from vomit, but a lot from my arms and legs which I would absolutely shredded with a blade.)|bleed
there was sick all over the floor and in my hair, and my clothes and face were wet with tears.|cut
I just believed there was something inherently wrong with me, an illness, or something about who I am as a person, which meant I would always feel suicidal.|disease
Depression still plagued me, it was still there in my head, but I found ways to make it quieter, and ways to make it hurt less.|disease
I used to have a horrible cocaine and alcohol addiction.|drug|alcohol
We would get high and drunk, fight, and then I would wander around all night.|alcohol
The whole time I am sniffing, drinking and cryingncuz all I can hear is her telling me how pathetic I am and how she never loved me.|alcohol
So as I am walking across I stop at the spot where I was going to jump.|jump
I went home and passed out due to all the alcohol and exhaustion.|alcohol
That still ended up being the last gram of coke I ever bought.|drug
I quit my job a week later and moved out of a heavily toxic area I lived in my whole life(dealers every, easy access to drugs 24/7).|drug
"That was over 3 years ago and I am still coke free and doing better in life than I had ever thought possible """|drug
Time to horde pills for the next try.|drug
When my hands were shaking so badly from the drug withdrawal that I could not even tie the noose, I was so glad I was incapable of killing myself.|hang|drug
I put my earbuds in, put on some soothing music, and tied a plastic grocery bag around my head with some rubber bands.|hang
I was so out of it that I did not notice the bag had a tear in it.|cut
I ended up falling asleep from a fair bit of Xanax I had taken, but then I woke up the next day feeling even worse.|drug
I was also very drunk.|alcohol
My first time I was 12 and the cliff I went to throw myself off was not anywhere near as high as I had thought, so I just found a piece of glass on the ground and cut myself up with that.|cut
I remember laughing as I did it because I did not have to worry about any kind of bloodborne diseases or infections because I would be dead soon anyway.|disease
No gory mess, no hanging, no splat.|hang
I wake up and this feeling washes over me and I lay there shaking, crying, and ripping away at my skin.|cut
In that moment I wish I had more resolve, to continue swallowing, persisting through the tearing of my throat and the blood trickling into my stomach.|bleed
I wish enough of the pills and alcohol were absorbed into my body to finish the job.|drug|alcohol
I lay soaked in a pool of my own blood, bile, and tears.|cut|bleed
I think if I can lick up even one pill I will die.|drug
Every joyous memory floods through my mind.|drown
I have been taking medications for the past 19 months, seeing a psychologist and phychiatrist monthly.|drug
If you choose to take medication, it will take a very long time.|drug
Not only do you have to find a medication that works well for you, with minimal to zero side effects, you have to get the right dosage.|drug
You might have to try upwards of 10 medications, and perhaps even combinations.|drug
It takes time, you have to slowly build up the dosage.|drug
Jumped off this local factory, roughly 6-8 stories.|jump
The second I jumped, everything in my life was resovable, everything was normal, I could see how I was gonna do this and that.|jump
"Have to plan better next time, and for god''s sakes, just use some rope!'"""""|hang
I did not have a good place for hanging, and since I am quite overweight, I did not want to risk the mess of decapitation.|hang
I do not own a gun, and that would also be messy.|gun
Poison is usually ineffective, and I knew I would probably get scared and call for help.|drug
I finally decided on aphxiation through helium.|drug
I really dislike going to the doctor, so I would avoid going at all costs, which was why I just stopped taking my medicine when it ran out.|drug
My doctor got me back on my medication and prescribed me zoloft.|drug
I was a mess and could not answer it right away so I let it ring, but the timing of it really tore me up and I got so sick feeling I puked.|cut
Those were my first thoughts when I woke, after I swallowed as many pills I had of my medications.|drug
The drugs meant that, when I called the ambulance, I could not speak properly and they did not understand what I was saying.|drug
I do not remember it, but apparently I was very excited the hospital would let me drink apple juice.|alcohol
"Ok.'""I drank on top of popping some oxys..."|alcohol
I thought I could just build roof but abandoned that idea because damp would be everywhere so I made a little shelter out of dead branch, dry plant, whatever it is I am not sure what its called in English.|hang
I was so hungry the next day waking up, my Cola was out and I drank from the waterstream.|alcohol
Thought about hanging myself but I did not bring any rope or something I could use.|hang
I had a belt but I did not think about it a time cause I am an idiot.|hang
Apparently they searched for bus station and my equal of Social Security was recorded there on a bus, tracked the driver down and asked me where I got off.|vehicle
I did not think much of hanging there or otherwise I would have but yeah.|hang
I did not eat anything after the day 3, went on water and some plants that looked safe at the time ( but I think I just ate it to feel something other than grumbling)|hang
I was bullied severely for the way I looked and was raised and I tried to hang myself but the rope broke.|hang
So that just confirmed I was a fat cow who is hair was like a horse and all the other mean shit people said about me.|drug
"'""I was sure I took a lethal dose."|drug
I took several pills, the main were a large blue one to normalize an anomaly in brain waves caused by irreversible brain damage to the right front lobe.|drug
I was very depressed for many valid reasons, going through the darkest point in my life, and therapy was giving me a glimmer of hope that the medicines provided by my apathetic toad of a psychiatrist extinguished.|drug
I was taking a massive dose of 8 of the largest clonazepam pills available per day, but that night I took more or less 70 pills, all that I had left at the time.|drug
With every nightly dose, I felt an overwhelming cloak of lethargy lull me to slumber within minutes.|drug
Immediately after, I ceased taking all medications against all medical orders (I know now it was quite dangerous to quit them like that, but to be fair it would not have made a difference at the time, more encouragement even), only to endure several torturous weeks of adapting my body to live without benzodiazepines.|drug
"'""I tried to over dose in my teens."|drug
I was going to over dose and cut myself.|cut|drug
After consuming bottles and bottles of Tylenol and who know what else, I started to throw up.|drug
At 10 years old she called 911 to get me help after she noticed all the empty bottles and cuts all over my wrists.|cut
My mother had walked into the room right as I was about to attempt suicide, I was about to cut my wrists at 11 years old.|cut
I put a gun in my mouth and it jammed on me.|gun

Well I had attempted to hang myself when I was 15.|hang
So I got myself all strung up by a belt stuck in the door jam of my closet, stood up on a stool, and tried to get the courage to knock the stool over.|hang
I hanged for about fifteen seconds, just long enough to make things start to go black.|hang
And then the cheap plastic belt I was using broke.|hang
The belt broke and I was still here, and 2.|hang
Thank god the belt broke and I was still here.|hang
Bit late, but I tried hanging myself in my closet in the clothes rack.|hang
I used a dressing gown rope which ultimately broke.|hang
I came home, boxed everything up so no one would be inconvenienced by having to sift through my things, wrote a letter expressing my deep sense of hopelessness and apologizing to everyone for every small wrong I would committed, outlined a brief will, carefully folded the letter as to make sure it would fit perfectly into the envelope I had labeled **DNR**, and washed down the pills I had with whiskey.|drug

I had just taken 45-60 benadryl (not sure how big the bottle was, but it was the whole thing) and did not expect to wake up.|drug
I have done a lot of drugs, but nothing feels stranger than ODing on benadryl.|drug
Except smoke cigarettes and do as many drugs as possible.|drug
So I give myself the biggest dose that I could at one time, 60 units of fast acting insulin (it usually takes care of around 600g of carbs) and instantly regret it, so I run to the corner store across the street and get like 4 liters of sodas, and assorted chocolate bars, and dial for a Chinese delivery that arrived about 20 mins later.|drug

I decided to hang myself with an extension cord in the rafters of my garage.|hang
During the test run, I slipped off my chair and actually hung myself.|hang
Not so much a thought, more the realization that my mother was not upset because I had just tried to kill myself but was angry because the rope had dug deeply into the ceiling rafter and ruined the paint before it snapped.|hang
I hung myself.|hang
But the rope broke after I would passed out.|hang
I freaked out and called 911 because I would split my scalp open.|cut
Here I was, ready to die, and now I was scared that I was going to bleed to death.|bleed
He did not like seeing the broken rope hanging from the beam.|hang
As for the split scalp, I received   fourteen stitches.|cut

What my mom's reaction would have been if she had found my lifeless body swinging from the rafter on her way to get her work clothes out of the laundry.|hang
Above all, the thing I remember the most was the momement when I kicked the stool out from under me and felt weightless for a split second and realized that every problem I had, every situation I was in, except for the one I had just put myself in, was not permanent and could be fixed.|hang
Almost had a fourth attempt, gun was under my chin.|gun
So I put the gun down and got a tattoo instead.|gun
My first attempt, I used my old belt around my neck and tied it around my neck.|hang
I tied the other end on my bed frame and I tightened and pulled hard till my vision was blacking out.|hang
I jumped off the tallest bridge around, honestly there was no reason why I should still be alive.|jump
Any other plan you might have had soon disappears, and the only option in front of you is your very last option: jump.|jump
Either stay and suffocate, or jump and feel a few brief moments of peace.|jump

The first time I attempted suicide, I hung a belt from a hook on the ceiling, put it around my neck, jumped off a chair, and tore a huge chunk out of the ceiling of my room as I crashed to the floor in a pile.|hang

Got my older brothers gun (Merica), went to the garage.|gun
I pulled the trigger with the gun to my temple.|gun
I managed to make an excuse that it was an accident, that I was playing with the gun in the garage and shot myself by mistake.|gun
I had squeezed the trigger too hard, jerking the gun upwards so the burn-mark on my head was not at a direct angle.|gun
  I tried to strangle myself with a rope.|hang
The knot I tied managed to loosen itself enough so that I woke up again after two minutes (I passed out in < 5 seconds).|hang
I just double knotted the constrictor knot and tried again.|hang
Then I figured I needed a rougher rope that had more friction, so I stopped for the night and went to sleep.|hang
"Still have those rope burn scars on my neck, but I am feeling better after being sent to a psych ward."""|hang
Failed hanging, and nobody knew about it.|hang
I went to sleep after taking an overdose that by rights should have killed me, expecting never to wake up.|drug
But this time I was sure I was not going to fail, so I took my fathers gun that he keeps for self protection, aimed at my head and fired.|gun
"I am a relatively small girl so the kick from the gun instantly blew me back and as I laid on my parents bedroom floor all I could think was, '""I am dead."|gun

I was bullied quite badly, when I started comprehensive school, and it was when I would just started there too, and the teachers did not really do much about it, and my family picked on me quite a bit too, so with everything piling up, I started attempting, at first I would get my dressing gown, and tie the belt around my neck, a part of me knew this would not kill me, without me hanging, but I believe on a subconscious level, I wanted to find out if I would be able to hang myself.|hang
Another attempt was to drown myself, in the bath, I submerged myself, and after a few tries of this I got very close, but at the last minute, my body just brought itself out of the water, and I started breathing, and the closer I got, the more unpleasant it felt, so I stopped, I did not really have a thought, after this, I just got out and carried on as normal, but I did find it too unpleasant to try again.|drown
On 12/12/12 (easiest day to remember) I overdosed on 40 Tylenol with codeine.|drug
I was being reckless at school and smoked some pot and got in trouble so my dad had to pick me up.|drug
decided I could not fuck up anymore than I had so I went home and took all the pills I had left in the bottle.|drug
As an aside, I would been cutting and burning my arms for a while and had been in and out of different psych hospitals for a few years so my dad figured I would do something reckless after the suspension.|cut
Either way one thing led to another and I was at the hospital fighting a nurse who tried to give me Pepcid (medicine to counteract the OD) and I remember screaming and telling them to just let me die, things were all a bit fuzzy from this day.|drug
Six five hundred mg Vicodin and a bottle of rum did not do the trick.|drug
Something undid my rope nice and slowly, in mid air as if it was mimicking the movements a human would make holding it, then I felt something lift me and gently place me on the ground.|hang

Decided to just sit in the bathroom and swallow as many pills (tylenol) as I could.|drug
Went to bed fully expecting to die (I did not know too much about how much Tylenol it would take to kill me) I woke up the next morning and felt the lowest I have ever felt.|drug

I had OD'd, but the hallucinations scared me so much to the point that I ended up calling my best friend.|drug
Immediately I ran to the bathroom because my body decided it is time to get these pills out of you.|drug
It was right after thanksgiving dinner with my family(I had been feeling like shit for weeks and holidays are always worse) and we got home around 7ish, sisters and mom left for shopping a half hour later, so a couple minutes after they had left I grabbed my meds(I was taking 5 different pills and if I remember correctly I was consuming about 1050-1075mg of meds a day) and I poured a few into my hand(the largest was 500mg and the smallest was like.. 15mg I think) and I downed them.|drug
I took a bunch of pills.|drug
Thankfully, I had taken the pills with some spoiled milk, so I immediately puked everywhere, and I realized that I would be saying goodbye to all the people and things I cared about.|drug
My next suicide attempt is kind of hazy, I know it was mid June 2012, and I know that I did a significant amount of drugs to try to off myself and I remember telling my bf that I was dying and then I remember throwing up quite a bit and hoping it had been long enough that I would absorbed the pills anyways.|drug
Several years ago, I attempted overdose.|drug
So I survived because I did not pull the trigger, and neither did the police...Gun pointed at my head, sitting outside my apartment complex, had written the note, called the police saying someone had been shot.|gun
So I put the gun down.|gun

It always just made me hate myself more for lacking the bravery to follow through (and as many people will tell you, suicide is truly not the coward''s path: it takes guts to follow through)Most recently, I had been having rather frequent (a few times daily) suicidal thoughts, and was planning on jumping out of my 4th story window.|jump

Alcohol and a massive amount of pills.|drug
Puked a lot of the pills out before they desolved, guess I am mainly alive as I was out of my chosen daily poison (Rum), so I had resorted to whatever I had laying around, in this case, vodka, which I hold a lot less efficiently.|drug
So when I downed the pills I puked most of them back up.|drug
There was an old bunk bed in my old room, and I decided to hang myself in it while laying down.|hang
I was all rigged up, laying face down with the rope choking me out, when I heard some of my brothers friends start to walk in the front door.|hang
I did not quite make it to the jumping part, I had planned to, but had not quite worked up to it yet when somebody called the police and an ambulance.|jump
Which kinda scares me, because I still feel low a lot of the time, and occasionally something will ''set me off'' and I will drink myself stupid or something, I still have involuntary suicidal thoughts regularly.|alcohol
And again, and again eight more times, for a total of thirty something pills.|drug
Used an electrical cord and tied it to the door handle - I was afraid the closet beam would break.|hang
I took a handful of Benadryl.|drug
Wasn't much vomit, and was 6 hours+ since I would taken the pills so still thought I would done enough.|drug
Any moment I was ready and prepared for my liver to start giving out (the expected consequence of the OD) and then I knew that the end would come.|drug
I did get feint from blood loss a few times and once of my overdose attempts knocked me out for a few hours the way Nyquil might, but that was it.|drug
The first time I gave it a real go was by overdose.|drug
So I took whatever I could get my hands on - I know it was mostly my sleeping pills but I do not remember how many or what else was mixed in there.|drug

After consuming close to 500 sleeping pills, I awoke in the ICU extremely confused and disoriented.|drug
I am normally a sentimental schmuck...but I did not leave a note, never said a goodbye, I simply drove around town buying pills, my tear stained face turned to a brave mask, and checked myself into a hotel to end my life.|drug
I was still very out of it from all the drugs and maybe from the seizure I had?|drug

I had 10 minutes left in my shift before I was going to drive to the Golden Gate Bridge to jump.|jump

In the moment as I just pulled the gun out of my mouth I just threw it across the room.|gun
I am late as fuck, but I took 56 diphenhydramine sleeping pills on a Thursday night and do not remember much until Sunday night.|drug
The first time, I tried to hang myself with a length of chain, which slipped and pinched my neck--the pain of that was worse than dying, apparently.|hang
'I cannot even hang myself right.|hang

Never shared the full story with anyone, but here goes:In 2012 I was diagnosed with a neuro-degenerative illness and was told there are only a few dozen active recorded cases, and in past cases some patients have gotten something called [Morvan's Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morvan%27s_syndrome) which leads to fatal insomnia.|disease
Sleep deprived, confused, and angry I walked back to my house and downed ALL of my pills.|drug

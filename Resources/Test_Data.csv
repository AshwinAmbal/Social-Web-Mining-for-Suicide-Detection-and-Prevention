I started immediately crying because I thought everyone would hate me. Everyone was going to be angry at me now that they knew what I would done.[BK][BK]The doctor was kind enough to have me on no visitors for a while. Only doctors and nurses, who were all very very kind to me. I could not look most of them in the face when they came in. I felt embarrassed. Ashamed. Normal people want to live, right? The doctor, two therapists, and a nurse assured me that my family and friends would not hate me or be angry. They'd maybe be confused or a little sad, but they would be supportive.[BK][BK][BK]The saddest part?[BK][BK]I was right. They did all hate me. *all*.[BK]Did wonders for my depression, let me tell you![BK]
Maybe I should ask mom and dad for help if I cannot even get this right. [BK][BK][BK]I was 12.

I first read this as survivors of Reddit...
"'All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That''s how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.'""[BK][BK]This was the spring of 2012, I had broken up with my girlfriend and few weeks earlier, my grades were slipping, I was living with two other people who I did not relate with, and I just felt alone.[BK][BK]I had been out to the bars, and even being around so many people, I felt even more lonely.  As I pulled my car into the garage, I closed the garage door without turning the car off.  I just sat there with the car running.  My first thought was, we will I am here, and if I do nothing then it will all be over.  Then it set in what I was actually doing.[BK][BK]And I laughed, I laughed harder than I had in months, I realized how stupid and foolish I was being.  How weak and stupid I was.  I  laughed and cursed at myself for doing the one thing I told myself was unforgivable.  At that point 4 of my friends had killed themselves, and I would never do it to my friends and family.[BK][BK]I shut my car off, went inside and went to bed.  The next day, I moved out of the apartment, I applied and was accepted to study abroad, and even though it took some time, I am graduating this spring and moving forward to my life.[BK][BK]Going back to my the quote, I had two paths before me, I had my one bad day, and instead of giving into the insanity, I came out just a bit more sane."""
"Posted this before but I will go again.  [BK]My first actual conscious thought was 'Wow, I am so weak I cannot even kill myself.'"" A few moments later my thoughts were '""I am so strong, I cannot even kill myself.'"" Shit changed my life. Started viewing the world down the lines of '""What does not kill me only makes me stronger.'"" now I push myself to my limits and try things that I am afraid of. """
"That feeling of failure that some other folks have described is so real. I remember feeling really angry at myself, and disappointed, and like all that effort had not been worth it. I was also really concerned about my relationship with my mom, and whether it would ever be repaired.[BK][BK]Happy to say, ten years on, that my relationship with my mom is excellent. I cannot say, however, that I do not wish I had succeeded. Even though my life is better than it was, my brain has lingered in a 'thoughts but no plan'"" state this whole time. A therapist once called me a suicide opportunist, and it felt like the most real characterization of my mental state I would ever heard. Her feeling was that my '""no plan'"" was really that I would eventually seize an opportunity (bridge, etc), very spontaneously and with literally no warning. [BK][BK]I do not know. Things are better and I am the same. Thank you everyone, for sharing your stories. """
"Pretty much along the lines of 'Well shit. I am not dead'"". And then spending the rest of the day real pissed off and in tons of pain. Except the last time I tried in February, I was relieved when I woke up. Maybe that is a good sign but I still want to die in general."""
I am not doing something right. 
"I hope this does not get buried, but here it goes. Maybe no one will read this, but I hope someone does and it can help. [BK][BK]My first feeling was not relief, it was more anger and pain. I felt like a bigger failure than I already felt, and since I was handcuffed to a hospital bed and on my way to a psychiatric hospital, the tremendous weight of the process I had to now go through was overwhelming. I was in a locked facility for 17 days, and I lied to every doctor evaluating me the whole time. Told them I regretted what I did, that I wanted to live, that the incident seemed like it happened forever ago, blah blah blah. Just a steady stream of bullshit coming out of my mouth. The truth was I was playing for a quick release so I could go home and do the job properly. [BK][BK]I obviously did not. The way my mother cried when she visited me in the hospital has stopped me so far. Also, my best friend''s mother, whom I love like my own family, gave me the best advice I got during that time. I was talking to her about what happened, and I was kind of beating around the bush explaining what happened, and she stopped me and just said 'own it'"". That''s made a huge difference. [BK][BK]So here''s my advice to you if you are reading this all the way at the bottom of some Reddit thread.  If your life seems worthless and you hate yourself and you see no point in living, the hard fucking truth is you are right.  I am not going to sit here and beg you to get help.  You have a choice to make, so make it. But remember that killing yourself has consequences for your family, friends, community. And also this:  just because your life does not matter does not mean it is automatically better to be dead. Own who you are. To quote a certain half-man, '""never forget what you are. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used against you'"""""
"'Not like this'""[BK][BK]I became conscious in the ER. I still wanted to die, just not in a hospital in a traumatic atmosphere. I had taken paracetamol (too many to count) and had fallen unconscious after vomiting all over myself. My heart rate was dangerously low and my respiration was not ideal.[BK][BK][BK]After I came to consciousness, I accepted all treatment just so I could get out. Now I float round everyday, waiting for the ideal time to try again. [BK][BK]EDIT - thank you for all the support. Regarding the situations leading up to my attempt, I came to the sudden realization that I am one in six billion, an insignificant speck in the grand scheme of things. This is an overwhelming concept and I am still trying to confront this problem. I am not sure if I can handle another 60 years of insignificance."""
"'i have to try again.'"" [BK][BK]this was my first attempt, one of 4.

[BK][BK]that there is difficulty even in death. so no difficulty should surpass that of death. [BK][BK]i lived by that, i make my problems less complicated, at least less complicated then suicide.

Bandaged them up, called my counselor who told me he had a legal obligation to have me checked out. Spent the week before finals in the psych ward. Needless to say I failed that term and it killed my grades to the point where it snowballed into me dropping out of college two terms later. Most of my family still does not know (they blame me for being '""stupid and lazy'"") and I will keep it under wraps till I die ... or until someone on Reddit asks for it, I guess :P"""

Waking up the next day completely fine, wondering how I could have failed myself again. Ended up trying again the following week with the same results, and just kind of gave up and accepted the fact that I am a failure.[BK][BK]Although for the record, I am doing a lot better now.

This should have worked is there a reason I am still here??[BK]I find it strange the first post I saw was this one:[BK]   Ironically enough on April 9th (just a couple days ago)  marked it a year since my attempt.

"And I quote 'AW COME ON'"""""
Shame. That I had gotten myself into such a dark place I was willing to put my close loved ones back into the same position we had all just experienced with the loss of my grandfather to suicide just a few months prior. Shame. That I was willing to hurt myself and potentially my future daughter as the result my failed attempt. Even almost three years later, I still think about dying almost every day. It's a struggle and it is very hard when you want something so badly though you know it is wrong and you should not allow yourself to have it. I guess as difficult as it is I am lucky to have her to remind me to not give in. Who else is going to be dependable enough to care for her the way I do? 
It was fragments of things. All I remember from the first part after it is wanting things to go back to the way they used to be before all the bullshit in my life started, wishing it had worked, and just wanting to sleep for a very long time until everything was okay. [BK]I was 18 and in an a relationship that that was abusive in every way possible except physically. I have no doubts that it would have turned physical if I had not left. And I only left after he raped me. That was over 5 years ago. Things have gotten better but you do not forget or leave behind something like that. Most days are fine but there are some I just cannot handle certain things. Nights are the worst. I have had multiple exes tell me I have nightmares far more often than I remember. My dog helps me out with that now though, she is learned to wake me up if I am having a really bad one. 
"I asked the police officer, 'do I have to pay the trespassing charge?'"".  He laughed and said not to worry about it. Turns out I did not. """
There's a reason I am still here, and it is not my time yet. To this day I help others who struggle with depression and self destructive tendencies. I swore to myself that day, as long as I am still alive, no one would ever feel as lonely as I once did.
"I was very delirious when I woke up. I was in the ICU connected to a few IV''s, a heart monitor, and a catheter (and probably other things, but I do not remember much). I remember my sisters concerned face above me, and I remember the room''s TV in the corner. I was not aware that I was in the hospital, or that I would tried to kill myself. All that I could think of was the stupid television. [BK][BK]See, I had a television about the same size. A 50' Samsung. But this TV was a Sharp. I could not figure out why someone would break into my place, steal my Samsung TV, and replace it with a slightly shittier TV. I spent 2 days trying to figure it out. [BK][BK]Anyways, apparently I did nothing but say '""I am sorry'"" for 3 days, so I guess I was sorry that I tried to kill myself."""
"'god dammit'"""""
I felt more alone than I ever had before.  The few people in my life that I thought may care I was gone were now angry with me and distant.  No one wanted to associate or talk with me.  I was now in physical pain, not just the emotional pain I had been in, and wanted some positive attention but all I received was anger.  I was in the hospital, and even the doctors were upset.  [BK][BK]I had not expected that.  I thought I would either succeed, or at least if I failed receive an outpouring of grief and understanding of the real struggles I faced.  It turned out so completely different than I imagined.  In the end, I hurt the only people who I cared about, and pushed them out of my life.  That was several decades ago, and I have only reconciled with my mother -- I was never able to repair the relationships with anyone else.  [BK][BK]My second thoughts were how to move forward.  When you plan suicide, you do not spend much if any time thinking about the aftermath if you fail.  Lying in a hospital bed you spend a LOT of time thinking about what comes next.  It took a lot of therapy and life changes to move forward.

I wanted my Mom and Dad.
Most of it was a very irrational haze, the first conscious thought I remember was to immediately call my girlfriend, and tell her I loved her. I explained what happened and she did not say anything , and just cried.
I have tried a couple times, the first time I woke up and vomited for what seemed like a week straight and swore I would never try again.. Several years later I attempted again, I vividly remember how scary those last moments of consciousness where and thinking about how I should have said goodbye and that I would never see my loved ones again. After I woke up, two days later in ICU, I was scared because I did not know where I was, but then I was thankful to have a chance to see my family again.[BK][BK]I swore after that hospital stay, and the hefty bill that came along with it, I would not attempt again. It's been 5 years since then. I would be lying if I said I have not thought about suicide again. But I always remind myself of those moments before I blacked out, also I think of my brother who found me (we have never talked about it because I am ashamed and I know it deeply hurt him). I have also started getting involved in the community working with survivors and people affected by suicide. All of these reasons keep me from attempting again. There is not a cure and the feelings never fully go away, but you can find things worth living for.

Again, again, again. Need to try again. So I did. 
Wouldn't suicide failures be a better term?
I hated myself. I was such a failure at life that I could not even die correctly. After I left my note where it would have been found, I was weighed down with regret and embarrassment. I had to face everyone after the stunt I pulled. Once I was allowed to have visitors, my parents were the first to see me. I could not even say a word before they both had their arms around me, crying. Every negative emotion I had at that moment washed away. I felt the sincerity in the way they held me. I felt loved. I still battle my depression. It's even gotten crippling as of recently. But as long as at least one person loves me the way my parents do, I know I am not completely alone.

I cried. I am bipolar, and I could not remember the feeling of emptiness. At the time I could not understand why I could not remember the emotion, I had the memories of the experience but I could not remember the feeling. So I cried.
Why the fuck did not it work? Do i really have to put up with this all again? It's gonna be even worse now because I failed. I kept trying to find a way out as soon as possible.

"I am sorry if this is too unrelated, but I have a story to tell about something that happened last night. I make my point in the last paragraph.[BK][BK]I was under a lot of stress. I started out fine, but these thoughts started invading about these scenarios going wildly out of control and resulting in me being deeply hurt. Every time I caught myself, I would try to calm down and think of positive things instead. This went on for a while.[BK][BK]Then I heard my two cats in another part of the house have a huge fight. This really set me over the edge, but not at first. First I tried to think of it as a test to see if I can think positively even after that happened. What I was really doing was suppressing my negative feelings which prevailed anyway. I started crying hard and felt really low. It felt like there was something deeply wrong with me and that i was alone. [BK][BK]Then a really silly idea came to me. I decided to go to my dresser and pull out this stuffed bunny that I used to adore when I was a kid. (I should mention that I am in my 20s and male.) I have not thought about this thing since I was somewhere between 5 and 10[BK][BK]Anyway, I slept with my stuffed bunny last night and did childish things like hug it, rub noses with it, and just lay there staring into its eyes. The therapeutic effect this had on me was enormous and kind of unexpected. After just a few minutes, I felt this amazing sense of security and that everything was going to be alright. This is not something I feel like I could have done with any living thing I know.[BK][BK]At first I just laid there staring at it and just cried. Except this was not a bitter cry. It felt more like a release. It was as if this bunny was absorbing and deleting all negative feelings I was having. After that, I felt that sad-happy feeling like in the movie Inside Out. It felt like this bunny was really alive and had a soul and understood me. Whether or not this is actually true is completely irrelevant at this point. The feeling was real, and that is what mattered. I brought myself to tell the bunny out loud things like 'thank you'"" and '""I love you'"".[BK][BK]This was a powerful moment for me that I am glad I had. The reason I am saying all this here is because it might help you guys immensely to find a way to get in touch with the good parts of your inner child. Also, do not underestimate the importance of social bonding as it is a basic human _need_, not just a nice thing to have.[BK][BK]Edit: changed '""positive living things'"" to '""positive things'"".

I do not know of if this is against the rules to post,  but I am doing it anyways.  I just want to say thankyou to everyone who has posted.  I have just finished my first round of therapy after having depression for a long long time,  and every time I would have to fill out a form.  It basically asked on a scale of one to ten how you feel,  what you feel able to do and all that jazz.  The last question was if you have ever had suicidal thoughts,  why have not you attempted suicide this week? I could never really think of an answer.  Looking through a lot of these posts I have now found an answer.  Although I have had and continue to have suicidal thoughts,  they are fleeting.  They may last for around half an hour,  but they are moments,  nothing more.  So thank you everyone for posting in here. It's really helped me realize that just because I feel like that sometimes,  it will pass,  and I will continue. 
I was so mad I was still alive. I still am. I would have cried but my body was too dehydrated. It completely hollowed me out emotionally I am dead inside. I am just waiting to die now so i do not hurt anyone. I still remember the anger of realizing i was conscious. Sometimes when I wake up i get the same feeling knowing I am still here. Outwardly my life is together now, it is been a few years and I have achieved a lot but its always for someone else's sake. So yeah anger
"I threw up a whole lot and I was not really thinking about anything except for how physically badly I felt.  After I was done throwing up I cried for about a solid hour.

I did not lose consciousness. I do not really remember the immediate aftermath very well.

I am pretty sure all I felt at the time was frustration, mostly about how big a deal everyone was making about it.[BK][BK]I am better now. I cannot honestly say I am a functional human being, but after ten years or so I have grown up quite a bit.
I was sad. I did not want to wake up. I was just so tired of feeling, I wanted to lay down and just drift off. I suppose I woke up and threw up a lot, I remember my friend coming by with food and coffee, but I was just sad. I am still in a very bad place. Unneeded. But I do not think I will ever have the courage to try it again. I just wish it could have worked. 
Of course I could not do it right, again. Got to go farther next time, stop being a coward.
For me it was confusion. And the need to breathe. I was exhaling the contents of my stomach at the time. The pure primal panic took hold and I was just spewing tablets everywhere. Then I passed out for a bit, then I woke up covered in puke. [BK][BK]Then I crawled back into the house ( I went to the shed to do the deed) and crawled into bed. No one really seemed to notice anything had happened, my house mates just thought I was sick and I was FUCKING sick for about 4 days. At first I wondered if I was still going to die because it felt that bad, and then as I got better I just decided that taking a cocktail of all the pharmaceuticals you can find is a stupid way to try and off yourself so I put the decision off until I could find a better way. [BK][BK]And then I never did. [BK][BK]If my house mates every suspected anything they never said or did anything about it.

Ok so this seems like the perfect place to get some info and advice. [BK][BK]So my girlfriend's parents are getting divorced. It all started when they caught her dad cheating. In all the fighting mess he said he never really loved her and was just waiting for the kids to grow up. I believe this, based on how depressed he always seemed.

My gf has tries to help but just gets frustrated because her mom will not listen to any advice or do anything to better herself, in fact she is actively making her life harder by not going to work and not paying bills. My question is what do you say or do to help someone who has completely given up? It's like the only thing on her mind is how she can get away with killing herself.
I became aware of the beeping and the volume of distant murmurs turning up, and I looked around and was startled by the look of concern on the nurse's face. I felt immediately like trying to calm her but I sort of disappeared back into myself for a bit. The thing is you can never be sure whether you succeeded or not, that to me is reason enough not to do it, lotta people do not tell you that

The first one I can clearly remember was 'Now what?' My answer saved my life from then on out, 'I am alive'. Every day since I wake up and remind myself of at least one reason I need to live.

Depression is serious and all day sadness is not normal. Ask for help.
Thank Gods
I am going to be wearing long sleeves for a very long time.  My thoughts on suicide...people always seem to default to you being depressed.  I do not think that was ever the case with me.  Sometimes, life sucks and it is a calculated logical decision.  You are doing it out of compassion for yourself, to end pain and suffering.  Like shooting a deer that has been hit by a car.
Oh for fucks sake I did not chamber a round, eh fuck it, stick around and piss people off some more.

"Commenting on this late so my reply will most likely get buried. Happens to also be my first comment. Anyway, I am not a survivor of suicide but I am a first hand account of a survivor of suicide from the beginning. [BK]I woke up on the morning of June 1st, 2014. It was a Sunday and I had work so I would have usually just gone straight into the bathroom but this day, this day was different. I could have never known on this day my life would be changed forever. when I woke up I had an overwhelming urge to check on my older brother(D) . House was too empty, both of my parents gone. It was not a panic sort of feeling but more of intuition that guided me through my house and straight downstairs. Now if you knew me you had know I do not really go down into our basement ever because that is kind of part of my dads living space. When I walked down there my worst nightmare came true, something no sister, mother, father or loved one should ever see. It was surreal as I saw My brother laying face down on the floor. I ran to him to turn him over and there was no pulse. I shot into panic mode, when the ambulance got there they rushed him to the hospital. Where he laid in the same bed for a week. I could not ever describe the pain I went through as I went to the hospital every day to see my brother. Seeing him laid up in a hospital bed with a machine that was breathing for him and all these tunes and wires that were helping him live. You see the thing is, he slipped into coma and no one knew how long he was going to be gone for. That week lasted a thousand years. I have never seen or felt the pain I experienced in that hospital room ever in my life and I hope to never feel it again. When the day came that he woke up, I happened to be walking into the room. He was already semi awake with a nurse in the room. The nurse told him 'your sisters here to see you'"" and I think that is when he came back to reality. He was very confused at first about what happened, not remembering anything or how long he had been there. He seemed upset at the fact that he was in coma but he just kept saying '""I wish I would have never lived'"" '""why did you have to find me'"" I felt an immense feeling at that moment. It really does something to you when you find someone you love no longer breathing, when they wake up and tell you they still do not want to live is even harder. Good news is to this day he is still here. Bad news is, it still effects me And our family will never be the same.

That my mum was not there.[BK][BK]I grew up in an abusive home and attempted suicide as a teenager. I meant it. I really wanted to die. I never lost consciousness, but arriving at the hospital was kind of a blur. There were some traumatic aspects to how I was treated, both physically and mentally.

[BK][BK]I thought my mum would come to the hospital, hold my hand, be there for me somehow, but she did not.

And nobody did. I was just alone, with nurses talking to me like I was nothing because, they said, they had other patients who did not choose to put themselves in the hospital.

I smacked myself a good 5-6 times until I went unconscious. I remember waking up to my mom, and a counselor in the shed. They asked me what the hell happened and i tried saying i just slipped and fell but the bloody forehead/tennis racket told a different story. I ended up going to a real counselor who really helped me and helped me boost my self confidence. A few months after seeing this counselor my parents decided it would be best for us to move out of this town for my sake. I ended up completely turning my life around and went into high school pretty confident and became friends with a lot of people there. I was a class clown so that kind of helped as well.

I have attempted suicide too many times so far and each and every time I hate myself increasingly more and more for not going through with it.[BK]For the past two hours I have been considering it.[BK]It'd be perfect, it is storming here right now so the people I live with might not hear the gunshot as a gunshot.[BK]Life is shit and will not stop being shit.
That I was such a weakling. That moment was when I lost all emotion and remorse. There's no happy or sad any more no lump in my throat when I was in distress. It's pretty great honestly. Now I am a person who thinks people who commit suicide are the biggest wastes ever.
Glad I read this. Been though a similar situation. Indeed the depression sometimes gets a hold of me. Mentally I have to be tough to see the better side of things. It does get better with time. Although the depression still lingers. I have better days than bad days. I am glad you are still alive and doing well. I wish you all the happiness, love and positive energy ❤️❤️❤️
Shit shit shit shit this is embarrassing.
Im such a pussy i cant evem do that right. 
suicide
When I saw my dad holding my hand in the hospital where I had my stomach pumped I honesty had no words of feelings... I truthfully never thought about the people I loved and how deep that would hurt them until I saw the damage it did to my parents... Even today they constantly are checking up on me and making sure I am okay. Honestly I kept thinking how do I even go from here... I was back to the reality that I am back to square one but now it is even worse because look at the damage I have caused. 
Save.
i gotta get the fuck out this hospital immediately, holy fuck im in the most pain i have ever felt, kill me. all simultaneously.
To be honest, I felt a moment of clarity . I realized that I was here for a reason and that I could be a light for those in the dark. Since then I have been involved in various interventions  and such.

I remember just going to sleep right afterwards even though I had a math test and things to do the next day. At the time my only regret was that I did not wear turtle necks or a hoodie or something because when my Mom saw the marks on my neck I just wanted to kill myself all over again.

I am sorry for anyone still hurting in this thread. My prayers and thoughts go out to you. 
I have to pee.
Fuck. Now I have to explain this to my mom. That's how she found out I was gay.
I wish my mom would not have called me. I am fairly happy right now but sometimes it still gets rough for me and I wish I would have been able to finish before she almost found me.

Intense disappointment.
Coming out of a medically induced coma, I woke up fairly angry and was not happy with my parents being in the same room with me. I requested to speak with my friend Brittany, and eventually the anger left me. The next few days I felt numb and was tired of being in the hospital. I remember watching Benjamin Button. That's about all there is to tell.
Most of the time it was sadness followed by relief. Sad that I needed to keep on going through the hell but also relief over it was not over. I tried a few times. I also got angry at myself for being a pussy and not do it properly. Today I am glad I never succeed.

My father expressed his disappointment and my mother kept asking questions I had no answers for.  I believed they were not real, just visions to torment me.

I did not realize I was not dead until after I was settled in and friends started coming to see me and giving me support and encouragement. 
This is such an inspiring thread, though it feels weird to say that. When I suffered from depression I never attempted suicide but the thoughts were there, and sometimes fleetingly still are, which is scary enough for me.

Just saying, this post is going to be one hell of a trigger for some people....
I was too busy having seizures, vomiting, blacking out, and hallucinating my balls off. Once that went away it was mostly 'well now my life is TOTALLY fucked. Ground zero. ugh.' [BK][BK]
This is a depressing thread. I just thought of my poor grandma (that raised me) almost losing another member of her family. [BK][BK]Edit: Also I was very embarrased because all of my family knew and I could not of anything more[BK]
I was embarrassed. I came to at the hospital and then it hit me that every person there knew why. I felt bad that they were having to deal with me when that bed could have been used for someone else. 
How nice everyone was being despite how much work and problems I had caused them. The nurses were so gentle. Even the cops were nice (I think my partner had mentioned a questionable military history so that might have been something to do with it) when they pulled me through my door. I was bummed that I would been saved until I saw my little girl and then I knew I would made a huge error of judgement. 
For me it was why had I not tried harder. Woke up in intensive care.[BK][BK]I am healthy and happy now with a little girl so I am glad I did not succeed but at the time I would have given anything to die.
"When the shot fired and it did not work, I thought to myself, 'Fuck...'"" En route to the hospital, I asked the paramedics if I could call my mom to say sorry."""

With any luck, I will not be responding to this. The day is coming soon. And if I have done it right, there will be no after.

"Ow.[BK][BK]Follow quickly by 'God fucking dammit.'""[BK][BK]Honestly, it was a considerable hit to my ego that I could not even kill myself properly."""
Thank fuck, because it was a really shitty idea.
I was sorry. To everyone around me. At 7 years old I had already had 4 people in my family attempt and fail which I think caused a very bleak outlook but after I first attempted  I finally realised it was a serious thing to everyone else. It hurts everyone else. I did not want to live and that did not change for a very long time but I did not want to hurt anyone else anymore. 
"My first thought was 'If this is hell, god must have a really fucked up sense of humor'"""""
Dunno if i should have just used a throw away, but woke up, cleaned the wound, disinfected, bandaged it, and taped it. Then I cleaned the knife, cleaned the floor, ate food, and went to school. I finally thought about what I did, and just sat on top of the monkey bars. Nobody knew, there was no note, and idk i just felt empty. I guess I am fine now.

I was so upset with myself that it had not worked. There was not any feelings of 'yes, I am alive', just this horrible emptiness that I was still this husk of a person beforehand and would continue to be. 
I have a pile of zopiclone sitting on my nightstand waiting for me to just say my final goodbyes. I live at home still with my dad and sister. There have been days where I have gone all day without seeing them. And its occurred to me that they would never know I would attempted something. Or succeeded until it was much too late.[BK][BK]I have tried before and ended up hospitalised. The last time I tried was the Saturday before Robin Williams died. Finding out he had succeeded where I had not and having to live in a world where he is not around made things worse overall.

If I had succeeded, what had I hoped to accomplish? I would be dead, and the person who attention I was trying to get would not be able to do much, as I would be dead.[BK]Also, did I mention I would be dead? It took a while to realize how serious it was and how silly I was being. Self-hospitalization later and I was more on an even keel. It's never over though, you only win the battles.
"'Fuck, where am I gonna hide everything, my clothes are ruined, and I have to make breakfast because I am fucking starving.'"""""
Nobody will see this,  but I immediately felt so much regret for my ex. She took me to the hospital. I could never apologize more for putting her in that spot. [BK][BK]We've talked since and it is been OK.  
Pure, straight anger.  So angry that it did not work, so angry I would have to deal with the consequences.

I was in denial for the longest time, so much so that I essentially convinced myself it was an accident. I only remembered my actions and thoughts leading up to that point maybe 6 months later and it was a HUGE realization. Maybe it is because I was just intoxicated all the time back then and my memory sucked but it is as if my brain actively repressed my actions leading up to it in order to spare me the pain after. Everyone was so upset and I was just.. not. It makes sense now but it made none then.
My first thought was that I obviously could not tell my parents or anyone really. I went to school the next day still feelings like death and had to just push through it.

I remember waking up in the hospital ward confused as to why I was there, then being hit with a huge sense of shame and embarrassment. After a psych assessment I was discharged (I think they were pretty overrun - other than getting my stitches done I did not see a single doctor), my parents picked me up and I spent the whole day wishing I would succeeded. I often still do, to be honest. However, I do not think I could ever attempt anything like that again, having seen the effect it had on my family.
"'Damn. How''d my wife hear me?'"""""
"'Now I will have to go to work in the summer with long sleeves.'"""""

It's funny how suicide is illegal, just a thought...

Wow, that made a mess. And I could not even do that right either. Great.
I realized I was tough to kill.
The camera kept falling down at the edge of the cabinet, did not have a tripod though. Lol
I wished I had succeeded.  I have gotten much better over time.
I felt angry and hurt- almost like I had been cheated somehow. Then all I could think about was how overwhelmingly disappointed and upset my family and friends would be with me.[BK]
"'Great, even managed to fuck that up!'"""""
"After the blackness cleared from my eyes, my first thought was 'welp, smells like dinner is ready'"". Then I went downstairs and ate.

try harder next time.
thank you all for sharing.  this is a heartbreaking read.  every story is important.  Not for a minute do I think I could even try and help, except to listen to what you have to say and give you a huge hug
The first time I had been called in the night by my parents telling me my sister was put in a mental hospital, I called that next day and told her I love her and would be able to talk any time (as I usually tell her whenever I see her). When I got the same call again this last week, well, I still have not called her. I spent all of my spring break driving out to her and my moms new home. I do not know, I just want to help.
I was pissed.
"'...shit.'""[BK][BK]I apparently had not known what I was doing, because I woke up that next morning with nothing more than a terrible headache and an uneasy stomach. I tried to go to lunch anyway, stuck between planning on doing it again and running to the campus counselor.[BK][BK]When I was standing in line some girl asked me how I was doing. Didn''t even know her, but I croaked '""oh, you know, I am alive'"" before I thought about what I was saying, and proceeded directly to the school counselor after that, because the fact that I COULD still say '""I am alive'"" freaked me the hell out."""
First thought? Christ, I cannot do anything right.
Mom had always told me I would kill myself, and that I was useless, so one of my first thoughts was 'I guess she is right again'
"'what have I done? How and why did I let this happen?'"" it was the biggest turning point in my life..."""
I have to face my problems now but at least I will be taken seriously.
Didn't want to think. Just reacted.
I immediately felt betrayed by my boyfriend at the time (who found me and called the police). Then it became overwhelming guilt to how much pain I caused him. That sunk in more and more as time passed. We got back together after the incident. I felt sick around him because I was stupidly selfish that day.
I do not remember doing it. My therapist said I disassociated. When I realised what was happening, I was sitting on the floor of my room with empty prescription packets infront of me. I tried to pick myself off the floor but could not. I had to scream for my parents - I did not want to die. Yes, I was depressed, yes I thought about it a lot - but I did not want this. [BK][BK]But while I regretted it then, I do not regret it now. That moment was my wake up call. I broke up with my abusive ex, hired a personal trainer and got a job. Life is good now. I am happy again. [BK][BK]
Shit.
"'I failed'""[BK]I was genuinely mad at myself."""
I should not have wasted so many hydros just having a good time.
I even mamaged to fuck this up.
That I was being stupid and should embrace life as such. (I also suffer from tanathophoby, so its a pretty fucked up thing, though I dislike talking about it).
Everything had an answer, and I would not always be so sad. Life was precious, even if I hated it.
Resistance is futile.

Relief.[BK][BK]I tried to crash my auto and die at 100+ mph, but I hit the breaks like 50 meter before and tried to steer away from crashing into a tree (I made sure to crash where I would have hurt nobody else but me). I was going too fast tho and I lost control over the car nonetheless, car was destroyed I was unscratched.[BK][BK]I felt huge relief, and I had 5 amazing years after.[BK][BK]My biggest fear to break was not to spare my life tho, but the fact that I could remain paralized or something and live an even worst life.[BK][BK]But after you are close to dying you appreciate being alive and see things differently, so I lost my intentions to kill myself.
For a week or two afterwards, there was a certain out of body experiences.

From the way things were looking in the hospital room (clearly I misconstrued the situation) I thought I was being arrested. My first thought was of the dread of loosing my job because I would have to call from the police station. 
I am a severely depressed person, but I have an extremely close online friend of mine who is suffering just as much if not more. Thanks to all the stories it really clicked in my head. I told her that I love her and how I would hate to see her go. [BK]Thanks everyone.
Hmm I did not realise until a lot later but now my left ribs are impacted and I have trouble breathing sometimes.
Pissed off that I had been shaken a million times with no response, paramedics were phoned when I would have preferred to just sleep and not wake up. 
Oh fuck. I did not make it... 
I felt stupid that I chickened out and drove myself to the ER to get my stomach pumped.
Well, my parents saw what I was going to try and do and they stopped me. I felt powerless and nihillistic, like I could not change anything. Still do, minus...wanting to kill myself.

I realised all my cats were clustered around me on the bed; and shortly after that, that my sister and dad had not noticed I would hidden myself away in my bedroom for two days.[BK][BK]I miss my cats. I do not have any where I live now. I would tried before, and tried since; my first attempt was at six (if you could call it an attempt: I got hungry and went home), and my last attempt was four years ago.

I took a whole bottle of about 500 aspirin, which probably saved me because it was just wayyy too much and my body threw up most of it. I had a horrible night and when I woke up in the hospital I just thought about my mom and how sad I have made her. It's what keeps me from trying again. I want to, but I have already hurt my body and my parents a lot. If I fail again it will just hurt everything even more.

That my neck hurt a lot, and anger that I did not succeed after trying so hard to sabotage myself into not being able to escape, so that even if I was terrified the job would be finished.[BK][BK]edit. Spelling
For me it was like waking up from a bad dream, I was terrified and disoriented. I did not know where I was, and I was horrified about what I might have done.

Wow, there are a lot of negative people in this thread. Bumming me out.
I was groggy and angry tbh. Plus I woke up when the meds came to get me from my place and I was in my underwear. I insisted on putting on pants and then lost consciousness again. But really my reaction to not having died was a sort of shame, I felt like I did not try hard enough.

Rage. Blind fucking rage. I was in and out of consciousness for a few days but that is all I remember feeling until I got transferred and sedated a bit.
I think my first thought more of a mental push to focus up and try to appear sober for my morning routine. No easy task after a whole bottle of oxy.

Honestly, I was just really confused and wanted to go back to sleep. I was intubated so I had this big hard tube down my throat and one in my nose and I remember just wanting to make them go away.

I was always a model student in the AP class. I have gotten several interest letters from various prestigious colleges. The fact that a suspension was issued to me rocked my world. This would prevent me from getting into college. No one would want someone who was suspended. That night, I snuck into my father''s office and found his glock. I stared at it for a good 10 minutes, then loaded it and put it up to my head. I could not physically pull the trigger. This does not quantify as 'surviving'"" but I wanted to share."""
"'I wish my sister had not come home from school early.'"""""
Fuck i am still alive

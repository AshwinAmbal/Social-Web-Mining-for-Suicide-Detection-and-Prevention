"Well I had attempted to hang myself when I was 15. I have a birth defect (deformed legs) and just could not take the bullying anymore. So I got myself all strung up by a belt stuck in the door jam of my closet, stood up on a stool, and tried to get the courage to knock the stool over. [BK][BK]Then I accidentally knocked the stool over. [BK][BK]I hanged for about fifteen seconds, just long enough to make things start to go black. And then the cheap plastic belt I was using broke. [BK][BK]I hit the ground and just yelled out loud 'OH FUCK'"" because 1. The belt broke and I was still here, and 2. Thank god the belt broke and I was still here. [BK][BK]Edit: Thank you guys so much for your wonderful kind words and support. As for what happened to the people who bullied me, one is in jail and the other is up to be a CEO. No clue how that happened but oh well XD  [BK][BK]I have found something I am truly passionate about (comic books and animation) and things have been on a steady uphill climb. And to anyone currently struggling, PLEASE PM ME! Feel free to just rant or get something off your chest; I am no psychiatrist, but I *am* a very good listener. Keep your chin up guys! """|hang
Bit late, but I tried hanging myself in my closet in the clothes rack. I used a dressing gown rope which ultimately broke.[BK][BK]When I regained consciousness I did not know where I was and my lamp light was very bright. I had drool running down my chin. When I got up it took me a minute or so to realise what had happened. I guess I was in shock as I sort of just put on a movie and went about the rest of my night like nothing happened.[BK][BK]It was during my psychologist appointment the next day the reality came crashing down on me and I broke down and was sent to the psychiatric ward[BK][BK]For a while I was so angry that I did not succeed and sometimes I still am. I am alot better now although I still battle with suicidal thoughts and severe depression. When I feel another bout coming on I choose little things to hang onto like the next episode of a tv show I like to come out or realising I need to read a book series.[BK][BK]|hang
"Just never really saw the point of living as a kid.  I always watched the news and read things that a kid probably should not have been reading.  Agonizing over every horror in the world.  I can remember being six or seven and reading articles on tensions in the middle east(like those are new!) then watching the news and hearing that we were minutes from nuclear war and just thinking, 'So, why?'""[BK][BK]I would lie in bed and spend hours trying to imagine what it would be like to be dead.  To be nothing.  It was scary at first but then it just seemed better.  I had friends and was popular.  I was college bound and gifted in academics and the arts but every night I would close my eyes and try to be dead.  Hoping that if I could lock my mind in on what it was like it would welcome me.[BK][BK]Fast forward a few years and I had just lost a job I hated, felt like my parents and family hated me.  I went to the beach one afternoon and decided it was just time to be done with it.  I had a prescription for a powerful sleeping aid so the method was clean and easy.  I came home, boxed everything up so no one would be inconvenienced by having to sift through my things, wrote a letter expressing my deep sense of hopelessness and apologizing to everyone for every small wrong I would committed, outlined a brief will, carefully folded the letter as to make sure it would fit perfectly into the envelope I had labeled **DNR**, and washed down the pills I had with whiskey.[BK][BK]Woke up or rather regained any sense of consciousness eighteen or so hours later and sat there feeling like shit and screamed, '""Are you fucking kidding me?'""[BK][BK]I have no idea how I did not die and it still kind of pisses me off.  I have not gained any sense of enlightenment or hope.  I am not suicidal anymore and while I think about being dead often the periods between such thoughts are longer as I get older.[BK][BK]Even as I experience success in life and allow my creativity to come out more than I did that voice is still there:  *This is pointless.  No one is going to remember.  No one is going to care.  Everyone is in transit and all things are fleeting.* it got easier to not listen after I unpacked those boxes and burned that envelope.[BK][BK]I talked to a therapist about it but I could see the look in her eyes and knew there were no answers.  She would prescribe something that would not fix anything.  It would just change the nature of my misery.[BK][BK]I have happy moments but they are always stained with the awareness of everything that is wrong, everyone who is in pain, and that in the end none of this really matters.  I doubt I am less sad.  I think I have just gotten used to it."""|drug|alcohol
"'Fuck, This is embarrassing'""[BK][BK]I tried to kill myself on the 1st of February this year, I am currently staying in University halls, the way I tried to kill myself was just to down a bunch of alcohol. That was the first thought that popped into my head and I obviously was not thinking straight. I drank a full bottle of wine, three bottles of cider, two beers in the space of about 10 minutes. I hoped that if I drank them fast enough (I am only 5'""2 and about 120 pounds.) I would get alcohol poisoning. But alas I just got super drunk and emotionally messaged my boyfriend what I had done, went to the bathroom and smashed my head on the sink intentionally in the hopes of giving myself brain damage, then passed out in his room. I awoke to paramedics standing around me doing all sorts of tests. (Blood pressure, sugar levels etc etc.) They asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital and I said no, they could not force me and since I was not in any actual danger they had to leave. [BK][BK]It was embarrassing for me because I am a very awkward person and quite a lot of people in the halls had seen this commotion and wondered what was going on, two people who were not my boyfriend actually saw me passed out on the bed."""|bleed|alcohol

No throwaway please excuse Grammer and format I am just putting this out there. I am just going to type it out. I deal with ptsd and depression at the time I was dealing with my issues that I hid after coming home from over seas my divorce and I was getting close to losing my apartment I got drunk as hell got in a fight with my then girlfriend I racked my shotgun with my girl in the room and her daughter in the room next to us and pulled the trigger. The shell was sitting on the floor and the shotgun did not discharge. I was put in hand cuffs and had the police surrounding me with weapons drawn. I tried to fight but gave up. I was loaded in to an ambulance and taken to the hospital. The sergeant walked in to my room and said you are a lucky son of a bitch and showed me the shell that should have killed me. I spent a week in the psychological ward. The things I saw there were worse then iraq. I saw people shit the last selves and use it like make up. My first thought when the fog cleared was I should have died and the barrel of that shotgun still looked oddly tasty. Today I  am not doing the best but I want to live.

"Immense guilt.[BK][BK]I was 13. I would been raped by a man. I could not get my head right. I overdosed on everything I could find and went to bed to die. My next memory is laying in bed on the hospital ward with my dad next to the bed. He looked at me and asked: 'this was not because of me was it?'""[BK][BK]I will never forget the guilt I felt in that moment. He''d been sat there all night scared shitless that his son might die and - wrongly - that he might somehow be the cause of it. He''s not what you had call an emotional man; he is gruff, pragmatic, conservative. Seeing the tears in his eyes and hearing his voice crack... it will stay with me.[BK][BK]20 more years later, that guilt is what stops going through with it now. I stand at the platform edge waiting for the tube train to roll in, or walking over Waterloo bridge on my way home, and I wish I had it in me to jump. I even went to Canada to try, hoping that the distance would somehow ameliorate the memory.

"'This is either hell, or the worst hangover ever'"" after a ton of under the counter sleeping meds with two bottles of whiskey. Woke up on the ground after apparently locking my room.

Driven by hatred, scorn, alcoholism, egoism and all the vile things that a human at the bare age of 20 can acquire.

[BK][BK]And that is exactly what I strive for nowadays, proving that there is a point to it.

After the click of the pistol, I sat there in a state of shock. I do not know what really happened. I swear I saw an angel floating in front of me, and that is why the gun misfired. My first conscious thought was I needed help.[BK][BK]The chaos of war while I was in Iraq, the ungodly vivid memories of the smell of rot and the way the skin of the water logged bodies slopped off in my hand while I was deployed to New Orleans for Katrina; and every life threatening mission I was on was going to kill me if I did not get help.

"I have been suicidal since I was little tiny. Common events like riding home from church would have me looking wistfully at the door handle, thinking how easy it would be to slip out onto the highway.  [BK][BK]I only acted on it after a situation went from physically abusive to emotionally ridiculous (I was 18, and my much larger brother unexpectedly turned and started wailing on me, pinning me down, repeatedly punching me in the face. The part that really hurt was my mom walked down after hearing me screaming, saw puddles of blood, and did not stand up for me. Even though my brother had his own place a couple hours away, he stayed at home, just watching T.V. with the family like it was a normal evening.) [BK][BK]Back to the topic, I felt so overwhelmed that I created a concoction that obviously failed. [BK][BK]I never told them. I decided to pack my things and move in with my boyfriend (who was a piece of shit). We lived together for almost a year before I could no longer stand his drug dealing, and inability to pay rent. I moved back home where I was treated like the prodigal son, because to the outside world I had simply shacked up with my loser boyfriend. [BK][BK]I have never told anyone the full story. Kind of embarrassing. Kind of an 'impostor syndrom'"" thing going on. [BK][BK]I am married with two kids, and I have not had a suicidal thought in about five years.

"'I guess if I cannot do it suddenly I will just have to kill myself slowly.'"" [BK]I had just taken 45-60 benadryl (not sure how big the bottle was, but it was the whole thing) and did not expect to wake up. I have done a lot of drugs, but nothing feels stranger than ODing on benadryl. The idea of quantum suicide is what really kept me from trying again. If there is always a version of myself that survives the attempt, and that is the one I experience every time, then there really is no point in trying to kill myself. I am gonna die when I die and there is nothing I can do to make it happen any faster. Except smoke cigarettes and do as many drugs as possible. After this attempt, that is exactly what I did. [BK]Then I tried LSD and life was pretty cool again. For a while. [BK][BK]I have been fighting the urge to kill myself for over a decade and I am pretty sure I always will. Even when things are nice it always feels like things would be easier to just be dead. [BK][BK]I hope you all find happiness, or at least a way to cope. Making everything a joke helps me cope.

"I had just been told via public Facebook post that my ex, who raped me, was HIV+. It was snowing that day, and I was too early to get into work, so I thought I would treat myself to a nice, hot breakfast nearby. After ordering, my phone buzzed. I was that person eating alone in a crowded restaurant who burst out into tears out of fear, confusion, frustration.

"Back in summer, I tried to do it with the car. I drove down a major road which ends in a roundabout. I pressed the gas till I was going 150 (km/h) then pulled the steering as hard as I could. I closed my eyes when I did it, and did it when I was entering the roundabout... It was night, so there were no other cars. [BK][BK]The fucking thing did not flip.

Posted my story in a similar thread a while ago, my first thought though was that I wanted to watch some Star Wars, so I cleaned myself up and went to it. Story is as follows:[BK][BK]My plan was to take a bunch of my parent's old hydrocodones and drink Southern Comfort until I passed out. Call it cowardice or whatever you will, but as young and as dumb as I was I started drinking before I took the pills. About half way down the bottle I choked down 8 tabs and chugged as much as I could.[BK][BK]To make a long story short, I blacked out and at some point barfed up the pills. Woke up slumped against a wall at 4:30 am on Sunday, February 21, 2010.[BK][BK]To this day I live my life as if I were supposed to already be dead. To me each day is a gift, and I choose to take each gift as an earnest sign that I have something to do on this Earth.

I decided to hang myself with an extension cord in the rafters of my garage. I decided to do a quick test run to make sure the beam would hold before saying my goodbyes to my family. During the test run, I slipped off my chair and actually hung myself. The panic I felt during those few moments I was dangling was all it took to convince myself I should live. I needed desperately to tell my mother I loved her before I went. My father too. I could only think of getting out of it, so I could give them their well deserved goodbyes, and let them know how much I loved them. When I luckily managed to get my footing back on the chair, I realized I was not ready to go. I had so much love left in me. I felt like it gave me a second chance to realize I did not want to go through with it. I am doing well now. I have two beautiful girls, and a man who would give me the moon. I am happy I had a botched run, because I am sure I would not have realized how i really felt if I got to text my final goodbyes. [BK][BK]EDIT: Wow guys.

It's actually a funny story. I hung myself. But the rope broke after I would passed out. I came-to on the floor. I sat up and felt something wet on the back of my scalp. It was blood. I would hit my head on the corner of a dresser. There was a nice pool of blood forming. I freaked out and called 911 because I would split my scalp open. Here I was, ready to die, and now I was scared that I was going to bleed to death. I will say, there was a young male medic that was with the group that showed up. He walked into the room and came back out white as a sheet. He did not like seeing the broken rope hanging from the beam. It really freaked him out. So I made up my mind to never attempt suicide. If a complete stranger reacted like that, I could only imagine how the person would feel who found me. I just could not do that to anyone ever again. As for the split scalp, I received   fourteen stitches. Serves me right. |cut|bleed|hang

I took a huge aspirin overdose, about 200 pills, and then got into bed and waited to fall asleep.  However, sleep did not come.  Hours passed, I developed stomach pains and the pains got worse.  I became sweaty and agitated and tossed and turned.  After several hours, I realised I was not going to fall asleep.  I realised I would be awake while dying, and it might take days.  The pain was already so bad that I realised I could not take that.  I had no choice but to go and wake my mother up and tell her what I would done.  I stood outside her bedroom door for ages, trying to summon up the courage to go in and tell her what I would done.  It was just awful.  We went to the hospital, and I was taken through immediately.  It was too late to pump my stomach, I had to be put on a drip and given activated charcoal to drink instead.  But the aspirin had really taken hold and I became terribly confused and spent the next few days having audio and visual hallucinations, and often not being sure where I was or what was going on.  When I came back to reality, I think my first conscious thought was hurt and dismay that everybody - medical staff, friends and family - were being so unsympathetic and downright nasty to me because of what I would done.  I was given no psychiatric help, just discharged after my physical ailments had been seen to.  I was 17 years old.  I am 32 now and despite repeated requests, still have not received any psychiatric help.  I would still commit suicide now if I could find a sure-fire way of doing it.   this happened in the UK if anyone is wondering.  The NHS is fucking useless for dealing with this sort of thing, and my family are totally unsupportive.|drug|alcohol
First thought three months ago when I was discovered and involuntarily admitted to hospital: “Fuck off. I don’t want your help. I just want to die. I don’t want to be at a hospital, I want to be dead.”[BK]First thought when the rope snapped a month ago: “All that pain to my neck for nothing. How the hell did that slip?

"The first time I was rather young, so when I cut myself and did not bleed, I freaked out and decided ''the universe'' was not going to let me kill myself. Turns out, you can totally cut yourself and not bleed for a variety of reasons; but I thought I had tried to cheat some divine plan and not bleeding out was the cosmos saying 'nice try, but not today'"".[BK][BK]The second time was a few years later with a handful of pills. I woke up two days later. I was super groggy and dehydrated, took me a few minutes to figure out my muscles again to stand.

And then, of course, remembering the first time, and this time thinking that the universe was rather cruel for not letting me die, again.[BK][BK]I have made plans twice since. A few years ago when I had been abandoned by my father and abused by his most recent girlfriend, I had decided on a method and had begun writing final goodbye letters. After sending out the first one, my grandparents called me up and ''talked me off the ledge''. I had a deep, heavy, ugly cry. I could not do it, knowing someone actually cared about me.[BK][BK]Last month, I started planning again. Things have been hard. This is all very upsetting for my shrink, who has not been much help. She pleaded with me not to go through with it, so... I have been self medicating pretty hard on top of my anti-depressants. [BK][BK]It keeps the demons at bay.

Mental health care is not cheap, even in some nationalized systems, and living in the US... well, if you cannot afford to be healthy, you are not.[BK][BK]I am not actively planning to kill myself anymore.

Weed is legal in this state, but I still feel like a useless addict because it is one of the only things that can make me immune to despair for a few hours.[BK][BK]I cannot afford school anymore, and I have accepted that, once more sweeping my broken dreams into the box of things best not dwelt upon. I am just going to find a job I can get by on, and hopefully get a cat; and maybe having something to love and love me back will help fill the void a bit.[BK][BK]Thank you all for your rare kindness."""|cut|bleed|drug
"The first thing I remember is being in the  ambulance with them forcing me to drink something disgusting.[BK][BK]Next thing I remember is laying in a room on a table or something begging the nurses to just let me die.

[BK][BK]Then I was in a room in the cardiac Ward with an aide who was not allowed to leave my side.[BK][BK]It was a horrible experience, they were overly full in the psych ward. I saw a psych doctor once and they released me within 48 hours. I spent the next four years in deep depression until I got tired of them experimenting with meds and feeling like I wanted to die. I finally broke down and told my mom that I have wanted to die for years and that this weekend either I am killing myself or something is happening to fix it.[BK][BK]She took me into my urgent care and I talked to this sweet older grandfatherly doctor. He very kindly explained that I needed more help than he could give me. That I needed to go home and pack a bag for a week away. He was going to call the hospital and tell them that I would be there within an hour and a half. [BK][BK]Going home and telling my husband and children that I was going away for at least a week was the second hardest thing I have ever done.[BK][BK]When we got to the hospital they were full, luckily I WANTED help so they were able to send me to the voluntary Ward at the UW. I will be forever grateful to them. Once I got there, I felt so much better.

I was with the boyfriend. He fell asleep, I wanted to forever. I remember nothing clearly after the ambien. But as soon as I came to, I have weird memory flashes. The boyfriend being in the drivers side of my car... The glaring lights of the first response. [BK]He tried to get me in the car, but my breathing slowed dramatically. He had to call 911. He saved my life.[BK]Those flashes haunt me, as I am sure they do him. For me, those memories force me to understand the pain and fear and panic he experienced.

I attempted suicide about 3 years ago, took 190 10mg ambien and 100 50mg tramadol to try an overdose. My dad found my body colapsed on the floor with major scrapes on my legs. He called 911 when he found me, and I very faintly remember being taken out if the ambulance (this was a Wednesday evening) and I did not fully wake up until late Sunday night. At first I tried to tell my family it was just a really heavy night of drinking etc etc, but I eventually broke down and told them everything while we were in the hospital. I do not really remember much about those few days I was in a coma, I 100 percent swear I saw 2 people sitting next to me, and talking to me at one point, but all of my family and the doctors say there was nobody there. I did not believe them, so they showed me the security footage of the time I swear 2 people were there, and on the screen there was nobody, it was a very surreal though (for those wondering yes I do believe in God, but that is not about this post). After I told them all what happened, and was finally released from the hospital I moved back to my home town. Now currently, I am finishing a computer science degree at my local community college, got promoted to management at my local Best Buy store, and just recently for the first time since the ordeal, moved back out on my own. I had been living with my mom since that time. I am still seeing a counselor and a psychologist once a month. I do currently take zoloft once a day as an anti depressant. [BK][BK]For anybody who is thinking about doing anything like that, I urge you to take the step and tell a family member, they will react completely different then you think. I have never seen my family be closer together as we are since I decided to attempt my suicide. They were, and still are, very supportive, and it changed everything about our lives. I really want to stress to people who are thinking about it to get help, do not be afraid like I was, go get help now. [BK][BK]I will talk to anybody who wants to talk about your feelings, or any questions people have for me. I have spoke some to churches and schools here as my testimony, since suicide is very prevailant in our society now. Please, if you want to commit suicide, talk to somebody first, I will be here for anybody who wants to talk, or if anybody had any type of questions. [BK][BK]I am typing this from my phone, and have already taken my medication so I will be asleep shortly. I will answer or talk to anybody who messages me while I am awake, otherwise I will respond/fix typos etc tomorrow. |drug|alcohol
Who's talking to me? (Was my family Dr) Of course I know what year it is and what my name is.(She was asking tons of questions)  Why are my arms and legs restrained. (Apparently I attacked the nurses and Drs) |hang
Honestly, my first thought was fuck, now I have to clean this up. My second though was, I am kinda glad I am not dead. [BK][BK]Before anyone can ask, I cut my wrists. Deep enough to need stitches that I did not get, but not deep enough to die apparently. That was eight years ago. I am so thankful I did not succeed. I am grateful for my life now. I have an amazing fiance, a beautiful God daughter, and a fantastic best friend. [BK]All I can say is, if you are feeling like suicide is your only option, it is not. Seek help and support. Life sucks, but it does get better. |cut
What my mom's reaction would have been if she had found my lifeless body swinging from the rafter on her way to get her work clothes out of the laundry. Her trying to explain what had happened to my little sister. Above all, the thing I remember the most was the momement when I kicked the stool out from under me and felt weightless for a split second and realized that every problem I had, every situation I was in, except for the one I had just put myself in, was not permanent and could be fixed. |cut|hang
After the first attempt: Fuck. Still here.[BK][BK]Second attempt: How did that not work?!  What the fuck![BK][BK]Third attempt: Alright, there is probably a reason for this.  Maybe I should do that whole 'keep on keeping on' thing and figure it out.[BK][BK]Almost had a fourth attempt, gun was under my chin.  Only thing that saved me was that I did not know how this woman I was developing a  relationship with would find out.  We'd just begun talking through text and Skype, and I had not told her how I felt about get, yet.  So I put the gun down and got a tattoo instead.  Death's Head Moth on my hand to signify the change in my life.  And now, we have got plans to live together by the end of the year (hopefully) and we are trying to bring life into this world.  Hopefully this is not too buried, and someone reads this.  It honestly does get better.  Daniella, if you see this, I have loved you from the first day, you chase away my dark clouds.

"Made a throwaway for this one. My friends know my real account.[BK]___[BK][BK]I have been secretly depressed and have deep anxiety. I take seroquel and zoloft daily. I fake enthusiasm so well that no one around me realizes that I am actually kind of dead inside. I put up a good smiling face for my family and friends and then crash and burn when I am alone, anxiety so strong it feels like I would die any second. My first attempt, I used my old belt around my neck and tied it around my neck. I tied the other end on my bed frame and I tightened and pulled hard till my vision was blacking out. The metal buckle broke and I lived. I felt nothing. No joy, no regret, no happiness. It was life as usual. I do not think I will try again, I just get tired of smiling for everyone else while I am breaking down inside. It''s hard. My life is an act. Everything I do is a act. My life is fake.

Throw away because my family knows my reddit and they think I am doing well.  The first real thought was confusion.  Confusion in where the plan had gone wrong, and confusion is where I was now.  I jumped off the tallest bridge around, honestly there was no reason why I should still be alive.  It was the world's cruel long con against me and gravity was it is method of torture.  After the first thought, the second was anger.  Angry because the entire point was to end my family's suffering because of me, and here I was in an obviously expensive hospital room.  [BK][BK]The next thought was actually quite peaceful.  Yes, there were new problems, quite immediate problems to deal with, somehow the older ones had gone to the back of my mind.  Things felt calm, and for a few brief moments, I could listen to the silence and not hear it laughing at me.  [BK][BK]Trying to kill yourself is not fun.  It is not a first option either, not a second, third fourth or fifth.  It's the last option.  It's like being trapped on the top floor of a building that is burning slowly beneath you.  You try to deal with i, try as long as you can.  Then it starts consuming you and clouds up everything else you are doing, and sooner or later all you can do is think about the fire, see the fire, feel the fire.  Any other plan you might have had soon disappears, and the only option in front of you is your very last option: jump.  It's not because you think you will survive the fall, it is because you accept death and understand that jumping is the easier way to go.  Either stay and suffocate, or jump and feel a few brief moments of peace.[BK][BK]It was the highest fucking bridge around and it was not high enough.  Maybe next time I will just try and find a gun.  |hang|jump|gun

throwaway because this is my biggest secret and is not something I am proud of. [BK][BK]Was 15. Retrospectively I lived a wonderful life, but decided to choose a permanent solution to temporary problems. Got my older brothers gun (Merica), went to the garage. Loaded it. [BK][BK]I swear my thoughts were ripped straight from the lyrics of a shitty 2000's pop-rock album. I imagined how bad it would make that whore feel, how all my friends would come to my funeral, how my parents who were going through a divorce would cry, how my brother would probably hear the gunshot upstairs and be the one who finds me, how my band would write a song in my honor – what an awesome show. Lot's of cool people ended this way – Kurt Cobain, Hemingway. You will miss me, I will be a legend.[BK][BK]I pulled the trigger with the gun to my temple. It felt like a hammer had hit my head, my eardrum exploded and I remember time decreasing in viscosity as I slipped out of consciousness. I felt warm. [BK][BK]I opened my eyes to a burning sensation going straight through my head. My eyes were on fire, I was coughing, I could not breathe. I could not see. I could not hear. Tears were rolling down my face. Blood was gushing down the side of my head. I did not understand what was going on. I did not think shooting off my head was this painful. [BK][BK]Then I stood up, dizzy as hell. I bolted outside from the gas filled garage and let the sun hit my face. I could not open my eyes, nor could I hear anything. The neighbors saw me and called the cops with an ambulance.[BK][BK]Turned out my brother only had tear gas bullets. I managed to make an excuse that it was an accident, that I was playing with the gun in the garage and shot myself by mistake. I had squeezed the trigger too hard, jerking the gun upwards so the burn-mark on my head was not at a direct angle. Everyone believed me. I got insane amounts of attention in the hospital from my family and all my friends. [BK][BK]I got exactly what I wanted. Now looking back – Jesus Christ what a dumbass I was.

I failed again and same reaction waking up. Then I figured I needed a rougher rope that had more friction, so I stopped for the night and went to sleep.

"'Holy shit, my ear.'""[BK]I was around sixteen and in the depths of my depression and other psychological disorders without medication when I decided to try and end my life for a third time.

Fuck, I am dead.'""[BK]But as I laid there for longer and longer and felt the hot blood rushing out of my ear did I realize that I was in fact not dead and in deep shit.

But I had just fired a gun in my house and SHOT A BIT OF MY EAR OFF. I had intended to die instantly so I would not have to face the consequences of firing a gun, but I was now missing a chunk of my ear and laying in my parents bedroom.

Oh God, what have you done?'""[BK]I got sent to inpatient for four months after this and slowly recovered and got my ear reconstructed, the only reminder being a small scar on the back of my ear, but even then, hearing loud noises scares the shit out of me and puts me into panic attacks.

It's sickening how depression lies to you. It tells you your situation is uniquely inescapable. No solutions aside from that final decision that so many people make every day.

I have never posted on Reddit before, but I think it could be helpful to someone, so I think it might be useful. Another thing I should mention is I have attempted on numerous occasions, so I can give a few thoughts after several of my attempts.[BK][BK]I was bullied quite badly, when I started comprehensive school, and it was when I would just started there too, and the teachers did not really do much about it, and my family picked on me quite a bit too, so with everything piling up, I started attempting, at first I would get my dressing gown, and tie the belt around my neck, a part of me knew this would not kill me, without me hanging, but I believe on a subconscious level, I wanted to find out if I would be able to hang myself.[BK][BK]Another attempt was to drown myself, in the bath, I submerged myself, and after a few tries of this I got very close, but at the last minute, my body just brought itself out of the water, and I started breathing, and the closer I got, the more unpleasant it felt, so I stopped, I did not really have a thought, after this, I just got out and carried on as normal, but I did find it too unpleasant to try again.[BK][BK]On another attempt (this was my first year of college, I had taken 2 weeks off, due to feeling badly depressed, and when I had started college I started getting suicidal thoughts as well, which I would never had before and some other issues got worse as well.)  After the 2 weeks off, I was feeling really low, a bit worthless and insecure too, and in a way, I felt inferior, so one morning before college, I put a can of aerosol up my nose, thought for a couple of minutes, but I decided to do it, so I sprayed, but with the way it was directed, it was more directed at my nose, rather than up it, so it failed, I was still a bit down and guilty (something which I usually feel, after an attempt) but I just went to college as I should have.[BK][BK]I am better now, I do get bad every now and then, and I do sometimes, wonder what would everything be like if I were successful, or if I was not here, but I found hope, it was not easy, but I started to look after myself, not in a vain way, but at those times, I did not really love myself, so I started to do that, and it does help, I took it one step at a time, but I eventually got through it. Also, if anyone here ever needs a chat or something, then you can feel free to PM me, I know this sounds cliché, but I am a good listener, and I care, so I will do my best to help, if I can. I am not a counsellor or doctor or anything like that, but if anyone needs help, I will do my best to help.|hang|drown
"On 12/12/12 (easiest day to remember) I overdosed on 40 Tylenol with codeine. I had a really bad eating disorder in highschool, so bad that I ended up getting an ulcer (excessive stomach acid from bulimia) and got a prescription for the Tylenol. I was being reckless at school and smoked some pot and got in trouble so my dad had to pick me up.  decided I could not fuck up anymore than I had so I went home and took all the pills I had left in the bottle. As an aside, I would been cutting and burning my arms for a while and had been in and out of different psych hospitals for a few years so my dad figured I would do something reckless after the suspension. He noticed I was twitching and looked not like myself and immediately knew I had done something stupid. Either way one thing led to another and I was at the hospital fighting a nurse who tried to give me Pepcid (medicine to counteract the OD) and I remember screaming and telling them to just let me die, things were all a bit fuzzy from this day. Then it got worse because as it turns out I am deathly allergic to Pepcid and I went into anaphylactic shock right infront of my parents after they would just watched me scream about wanting to die. So this was a shitshow. Just a mess where 16 year old me is ruining everything. I faded out of consciousness and woke up with a headache but saw my parents at the end of the bed. My first thought was 'fuck. I cannot even kill myself.'"" So of course I was put into intensive care and four years later I am doing really well at college and do not deal with the same issues anymore. I think what changed things was seeing how distraught my parents were at the end of the bed watching me hopelessly. I am really good at a lot of stuff I do, I can run 10 miles and I have a 4.0 and in general am doing really well, but I cannot fucking kill myself. Today, I am pretty glad I am bad at suicide and I am even more thankful that I was given parents who never ever even thought of giving up on me. """|cut|disease|drug

Been a stern believer in my fate from 90% to 200% from what I saw as I hung there blacking it. I luckily never succeeded. Started the process of a new life afterwards.

"'What the hell is going on! Why are there spiders everywhere?'""[BK][BK]My first attempt was with two full bottles of Tylenol. I knew over the counter stuff was less likely to work so I took a lot. I woke up in my room like 18 hours later. I could understand people, but there was this sort of a delay in my reaction time. The worst part is I was so messed up I was hallucinating that my skin was covered in small spiders, and so was the floor. I stayed curled up in the corner of my bed for another full 24 hours until the hallucinations stopped. Fucking terrible.[BK][BK]I remember feeling this weird mix of guilt, fear, and disappointment. How did that not work? Why did I do something so stupid? Am I going to be okay? What will actually work next time?[BK][BK]I am ashamed to say it (and honestly I have never told anyone), but I have tried a total of 26 times to kill myself. Most of them were in the span of just a few years when I was at my lowest. I have tried hanging, drowning, asphyxiation, rat poison, bug poison, alcohol, cutting, and more over the counter stuff than I care to admit. Every time I came to I had this sort of sense like, '""better luck next time,'"" or something to that effect. It''s like I was not even sad or scared anymore. I just was not anything, and that is why I kept trying.[BK][BK]I am transgender. It took me a very long time to accept who I am, and not feel like I should be dead because I will never be '""normal'"". Three years since my last attempt, and I am proud to say I am glad I am not normal. I am a stronger, more compassionate person than I ever thought I would be back then, and I am so elated I am here to experience life as a happy healthy version of me.

"I had long suffered depression without ever knowing what it was, and for most of my life thought it normal to feel like I had to atone for some nameless, unmentionable atrocity.[BK][BK]In my early twenties it all came to breaking point during my first year of postgraduate research. Just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong that year - my projects were failing (and not even in a useful, 'I could go in that direction instead!'"" kind of way), I was given a fortnights'' notice to vacate the family home, my 4-year relationship was on the rocks, and I was excruciatingly lonely at the bottom of the totem pole at the lab, with a supervisor who did not know how to and/or want to relate to me.[BK][BK]My then-partner found me sobbing in my underwear in the kitchen that night, halfway through making the first cut. It took two people (the flatmate helped) to pull clothes on me, then drag me to the local Emergency Department.

I was then confronted with loads of Good Samaritans who wanted to help, among them a nurse who knew what she was doing. At first I would not get out, but when she explained that she was going to wait until I did and that the car might explode, I could not help but relent. Apart from the self-inflicted ones, I was completely uninjured. This was seven years ago. I have been searching spiritually ever since.

In what in my recollection is a fuzz of intoxication and darkness of the night, I would called the ambulance on myself. I would spent the night vomiting black and scream-crying in the ICU. I remember being wheeled out of the ICU and asking a nurse '""Am I going to die?'"" and her answering '""No'"".[BK][BK]Before leaving my home, I would packed a spare pair of pants - not a book or phone charger or anything useful, really. After the nurses trusted that I was not going to bolt, they allowed me to drag the heavy IV pole down the hall, into the elevator, through the emergency room lobby and out to the parking lot to smoke cigarettes.[BK][BK]The next day, I was interviewed by a pair of medical health crisis workers. I told them I was embarrassed (because I would tried to kill myself and also because I would executed it so half-assedly), and fine, and scared of going home.[BK][BK]They put me in the closed ward. No door out, no asking to leave. A self-described manic gave me a (thorough yet short) tour. I needed to pee, and learned that I needed to ask a guard to open the door to the bathroom, and was not allowed to lock it behind me. I smoked a cigarette in a smoking booth with a lighter chained to the wall. After only an hour, the doctor came to get me out of the ward.[BK][BK]And just like that, they showed me the door. There I was, in the January cold, feeling absurd. I walked home.[BK][BK]Returning to my apartment and my room was the strangest thing I have experienced in my life. I felt reborn, and like an archaeologist. The empty bottles of pills and liquor. The computer still on, the clothes, the guitar that I only played when no one heard - the scattered artifacts of a normal life. The things that held meaning only to me. What would my family have thought at the sight? It was bizarre to think that if the me that tried to kill me had been more ruthless, that would have been the remains of me.[BK][BK]And at the end of that, I find it hilarious that the stress of cleaning up before people come over would not end at death.

When I was starting high school I decided to move to Florida with my mom. My parents had divorced and my mom packed up and left one day. I went from living her to living with my dad suddenly. My dad was incredibly poor and mean to me (looking back it was because of the stress of raising five kids with no money, we wasnt mean he was depressed). Anyway I moved to Florida and everyone was cruel to me. I had no friends, no one was even nice to me. I was alone all the time and incredibly depressed. No one in Indiana wanted me and neither did anyone in Florida.[BK][BK]So one night I went out and threw myself off of The Pier in Saint Petersburg (its a large shopping building that is on a Pier that extends into Tampa Bay). I just sort of climbed the railing and jumped in during high waves because of a storm. I figured no one would find me because it was late at night.[BK][BK]When I came to there were a group of four or five homeless guys that were trying to help me. I had worn a bunch of heavy clothing to weigh me down. They had stripped me down to my essentials (shirt and shorts). One was sprinting down the beach leading the EMTs to me.[BK][BK]When I actually was able to make thoughts again I remember just thinking about how people that had nothing in life worked so hard to save my life. I vowed to never let my struggle with the feeling of having nothing ever get the better of me again. I moved back to Indiana and started donating and working with the homeless. I vowed to dedicate my life to those less fortunate than myself, because I owe them my life.[BK][BK]I never did meet the five guys that saved me again.[BK][BK]TL:DR Tried to drown myself, was saved by group of homeless men, vowed to dedicate life to helping others.|jump|drown

I had pneumonia on top of it so ended up waking up three days later in a hospital.[BK][BK]On the other hand, I felt GREAT when I woke up. My cough was so much better after getting some sleep (I had not slept more than fifteen minutes or so for the last few weeks) and while I was out they used some kind of breathing treatment on me that cleared up at least half the yuck out of me.[BK][BK]Thankfully my doctor asked for the remaining syrup to be tested and found it was mixed to the highest strength, not the lower strength the doctor ordered for me. Doc figured if it had been an actual suicide I,would have swallowed the whole bottle, not just the mega dose I thought was a normal dose. (He was right)"""|hang|drug

I would not ever again walk in a calm summer evening, a slight chill breeze in the air. I would not ever sit on a balcony and watch the light clouds roll through the skies at night. I would not ever know true love, the feeling of being held by someone, early in the morning, just listening to each other breathe. I would not ever be able to see my friends and share our laughter, our tears, our aspirations, our late night talks, ever again. I would miss so many amazing stories being told. I would miss seeing so many places. Experiences. [BK][BK]So I just broke down and cried for a solid couple of hours. I carried on the next day.[BK][BK]I still experience depression. But I have never felt low enough again to get to that place. Because no matter how low I feel, I make myself remember: there is so much more beauty in the world. We are what we choose to be and what we do. We can form the experiences we want.[BK][BK]I have had so many wonderful things happen to me since then and I hope everyone who feels this way realizes there is so much they can contribute, that they can do whatever they want.

I was bullied when I was younger mostly, because my looks, but also for my behaviour.

Happy because my family wouldn´t get the new that I killed myself, but sad because I was still here and that I knew that I would still get bullied...

I had failed at everything in my life and I could not take the shame and guilt of being me anymore.[BK][BK]I took as many pills as I could. I picked up a bunch of pain pills and xanax bars. I took more than I could count. A girl I had known for two weeks came over to see why I did not come to class. She found me blacked out on the floor barely alive. She dragged me to the elevator and managed to get our advisor to drive us across the street to the hospital. I woke up afterwards wondering how and why I was alive. I was so angry that I could not get that final release of all the pain. [BK][BK]She told me that I needed to quit using and try to get better and we could try having a relationship. I had never been in a relationship before so I had no idea she even liked me. I went to treatment for the 6th time and we started dating. [BK][BK]I had never been shown the kindness she gave to me and the unconditional love. It changed who I was and made me realize that I am not the only person who would be affected by my death. She is the most beautiful, loving and caring person I have ever met.[BK][BK]Four years later we are engaged to be married later this year. I am sober and about to finish up my degree. Now when I know a friend or relative is depressed I tell them that they could be right around the corner from something life changing. I cannot say it is been a perfect ride, but my life is better than I could have imagined. There were a few major hiccups along the way, but I am still here.|disease|drug
Well I have never had the balls to straight up kill myself but I used to be addicted to heroin for 4 years. I never consciously tried to overdose but if I just so happened to and died from it well that would have just been alright. Shit everytime I stuck that needle in my arm I was playing Russian roulette. Like I said I did not have a death wish but I used to be super depressed and did not feel I had much to live for. Once I saw the light and knew there was much more to live for I moved on. Now I can deal with daily life and most emotions I face. Basic thing is to know you cannot get through anything like this alone. Help is always there do not be afraid to ask. I was for 4 years and I could have very well died. Now I have almost a year clean and life is okay. |drug

A day after Christmas last year I found myself extremely desperate to make my life come to an end, so conveniently my parents were out in town and we just happen to own two rifles and some ammunition from when we go shooting at a gun club.

Next month is going to be the one-year anniversary.|alcohol
Honestly? I guess I was kind of glad in a sense. As I was swallowing every pill I could get my hands on, I felt sad knowing that if this was the end of me then my best friend would probably never even know I passed & think for so long that we had fallen out or that I hated them.

"Tl;dr: 'A wordless, seething shame, '"" as another user in this thread so accurately and eloquently described. [BK][BK]To keep backgrounds short, I was a high-schooler facing neglect by my parents. My main supports were my friends, who I would kept since elementary school (a few of which are still my closest friends to this day.) These people, who had kept me around at my best and worse times when others would not, became the family I did not have at home. [BK][BK]I had a very specific suicide plan in place. I planned to OD on my sleeping meds at school an hour before lunch (since it took an hour and a half for my normal doses to kick in) so that I would be able to spend my last bit of time with my friends (my *family*.) I would then break away during lunch to walk a nearby path that led to a rock overlooking the Penobscot river. That was where I planned on peacefully falling asleep and dying. [BK][BK]I am sure anybody even marginally smarter than I was is able to see the flaws in my plan.[BK][BK]To keep things basic, medications do not work that way. I OD''d when I would planned to, but having taken 16 times my average dose, it only took about 15 minutes for the effects to kick in as opposed to the hour and a half I had been expecting.. and there is not a peaceful fucking thing about overdosing. [BK][BK]I was in the middle of English class, my last class before lunch, when I began to feel the effects of my overdose. I tried playing it off, believing I could make it the last half an hour. I thought I had been maintaining composure well enough to appear fine, but the people around me kept looking at me and asking me if I was okay. I felt light-headed, nauseous, and was weak to the point where it was hard to lift my head. That''s when I became scared. [BK][BK]I felt like absolute shit. I could hardly move, but felt extremely nauseous. I knew I would be laying on my desk, in the middle of class, soaked in my own sick very soon. I would OD''d to chase away the pain, not to find myself humiliated and scared in the middle of a room filled with people, the majority of which I hardly knew. I am not sure I regretted wanting to die, but I surely regretted the details. [BK][BK]I remember interrupting the teacher mid-lecture, slurring that I needed to go to the nurse''s office before stumbling out of the room and puking in the middle of the hallway. I remember crying, knowing everyone I would left behind in class knew I was fucked up. Everything is hazy afterwards, but I eventually found myself waiting for an ambulance on a cot in the nurse''s office, with the school officer and my mother both present. [BK][BK]I do not remember feeling disappointed or grateful for being alive - all I can remember is the overwhelming shame that I felt. [BK][BK]My mother stared at me for awhile without saying a word. The officer left the room for a moment, and I took the opportunity to ask her what she was thinking. Looking straight into my eyes, the one sentence she spared me was to let me know how disappointed she was in me. In that moment, I wished I could have been given a do-over. I doubt that is a memory that will ever stop hurting. I wish I could say that I had some big '""aha!'"" moment in this, but unless we are talking about the realization that my mother is a huge ass, it just was not there. [BK][BK]To anybody who may be reading my post and feeling suicidal - do not be discouraged by this. There may not have been a huge life-changing epiphany for me in the experience, however, it is been five years and I am still alive. This only proves that the big learning moments come through trying to live, not trying to die. When you are at your lowest is when you have got to work your hardest. Know that you **CAN** do it,  you **ARE** worth it, and that finding happiness **IS** possible. It''s been five years for me, and honestly I still feel bad just as often as I feel good, but even so, I am so proud of myself. I have worked hard every day, and even though I have slipped and fallen back into old habits during my journey, I still know that I am capable of progressing towards something better than what I am now. Anyone and everyone is, but it is on the individual to take those hard and rewarding steps. If you cannot do it yourself, remember to seek out professional help, or at the very least support from your loved ones. [BK][BK]If anybody needs a listening ear or would like some advice, please feel free to message me. You deserve to be heard and I would be just fine being the person to listen. I am sure many people here would. Stay strong. """|drug

I was 15. Coming near the end of my sophomore year of high school. It was 3:45 am. I had went down into the basement of my father house where the fun safe was located. My father taught me the combination in case of any emergencies in which I would need a gun to protect myself or the house, or grab important documents from it in the event of some disaster.[BK][BK]I grabbed the first pistol I saw, a colt .45 that was my grandfathers. Now we kept a separate ammo can but in the safe was a blue box of old ammunition for the pistol of my choice. I inserted a single round into the chamber and closed the bolt.[BK][BK]The next 10 seconds felt like years. It seemed as if time slowed down or even came to a complete stop around me, as if I was the only one not affected by it. Any and all sounds and bent noose just ceased. [BK][BK]All of that was just the 10 seconds it took for me to put the gun to my right temple and pull the trigger, hoping for nothingness.[BK][BK]All I heard was a click. I pulled back the bolt and the round came out. I checked the back of it only to see a dent from the firing pin in the primer. [BK][BK]I just broke down in that moment. I was crying on the floor for about an hour until I realized my dad would be getting up soon for work. I went back to my room and laid in my bed, only able to think about what had just happened. I went to school the next morning as if nothing happened.[BK][BK]It's now been almost 3 years since that. I am now 18 going on 19 in a couple months. I am now a college student or was. I was recently put in a psychiatric ward because the first appointment I ever made with a counselor in an attempt to finally get help, led  to the fear of me killing myself again. [BK][BK]I am now on medication. Not really doing better so I am going to ask my doctor about trying different medication. I have moved back home to go to community college and work while I get things in my life sorted out.[BK][BK]Not a day goes by where I do not think about me shooting myself 3 years ago. |hang|drug|gun
Mostly annoyed. The gun just refused to go off, both with freshly reloaded rounds, and factory loads. I got pissed off and chucked the shotgun under my bed and took a nap. Went to the range later on with my dad, and did not miss a single shot with the same rounds that refused to kill me. That was the last honest attempt I made, about 7 years ago. I have had the thought about once a month, and came really damn close about two years ago, but I learned from my dad growing up that all a man has is his word, and I gave my word to too many people to try again. So I just sit here and suffer while people try to cheer me up or ask what is going on. |gun
I stopped halfway through my attempt because I panicked and was not sure about it. My first thought was that I could not stand the thought of leaving my dog alone. [BK][BK]I told my mom and she was annoyed that I needed to go to the hospital on a school night. When we got there and the doctors rushed me in, then she started to cry about being a bad mom and I had to console her all night. The doctors consoled her as well. She persuaded me to say it was an accident and they let me go without any follow up. [BK][BK]The next week I tried sleeping pills but an ambiguous amount - sort of like Russian roulette with pills. Obviously it was not enough but I did not tell anyone that time. |drug
When I was 22 I tried to end my life. It was a very dark time in my life and I had recently reached out to a woman that I loved and she talked to me and, to make a long story short she came to my home and left as promptly as she showed which really put me in a bad state of mind. I attempted to use a S&W .40 M&P edition. If anyone here knows about this weapon is that it is safety is on the trigger and not one that has to be actively be engaged or disengaged. When I tried to pull the trigger, my finger was too high in the trigger well and the gun did not go off, thank god. I dropped it and laid in my bed and thought about how that moment would have effected everyone that I knew and loved me and I just could not do that to them, so I sold my gun. [BK][BK]Now, I am happily married(to that woman, yes) and have two wonderful dogs that I care the world for and have a great support system here in my home. It's still hard to talk about my depression and it still sticks with me, but I fight it tooth and nail every day. I am glad I survived and I am more than happy to tell others out there dealing with the same pain that I had... that it is OK. You are a wonderful person and there are things meant for you out there. Don't let those thoughts slip into your mind and change your patterns. Don't let your depression control you; I did and I am ashamed I ever let it happen. Read this and learn from it, know that taking your life is not the answer. [BK][BK]If any of you read this and need help, message me here.

"Maybe this dosent count as much as others, but I had the noose set up and everything, and just as I was about to kick out my desk chair from under me, I saw (yeah this it totally ridiculous) a ticket stub from a football match I went to.

It''s all surreal and the memories from the 2 or so years I was suicidal a lot of the time are just sort of a blur (this was nearly 2 years ago when I sort of came out of it), so I do not remember much else from the time. I have gotten more involved in volunteer work and stuff which helps a lot. My honest advice is to go get help. I was helped out a lot by free counseling/therapy sessions thanks to nationalised healthcare in the UK, but if you do not have the luxury of universal healthcare/money for therapy then there are a million and one ways to get out of it.

I do not know why but after going through severe depression with no treatment I have become exceptionally angry towards other suicidal people. [BK][BK]Like, I never explicitly tried to kill myself I just put myself into increasingly dangerous situations where I hoped I would die. I got into super bad longboard accidents, got hit by a car, got physically harmed in some way, but the next thought was always *I can do better*. [BK][BK]For some reason I never think about killing myself any more - it is always about getting myself killed. [BK][BK]A year ago? I thought about killing myself all the time. Daily, multiple times. I had several plans for how I would do it, but I was too scared of pain to go through.

Interesting thread. I have been thinking about suicide often lately, usually every day. I just cannot shake the thought of it.

Why cannot people just let me stop hurting?[BK][BK]I was driving my sister and I to school, and planned to drop her off, then drive away to find a secluded place to die. I did not have a lot of options, and did not really plan it out, but I brought a bottle of caffeine pills with a combined total of about 8g of caffeine. I am not positive in hindsight that it had be enough, but I did not care at the time. [BK][BK]Well, my sister pieced things together. She refused to get out of the car, and called my parents, who called the police. I ended up getting pulled over on the highway, so I got out of the car and managed to down most of the bottle before I was tackled and arrested. As I got hauled into the ambulance, I turned to my parents and asked them that first thought. I think that moment was the first step to recovering, after seeing how much that one sentence hurt them, and how much they cared. [BK][BK]I spent the next two weeks in the psych ward before being released on the condition that I continue medication and therapy. That was 8 years ago, and in that time, I learned the answer to that question: because people care. They cared enough to help me see that there are other options. I am not quite 'there' yet, but I have met some amazing people, one in particular, that I do not want to lose. I may still hurt, but it is a small price to pay to wake up to his face every day.

[BK][BK]I am very lucky that I have such a supportive and strong family, who helped me through the next few years (I was 16 at the time), got me into see a really good psychiatrist and spoke to school so that the teachers gave me a little more support so I was not overwhelmed by the stress.

Just over a month ago, I attempted suicide, and then the following day walked out of my school during class and walked for approximately 15 kilometers (almost 10 miles for my friends down south) in 3 hours through Canadian snow. I then spent the next 6 days in the hospital. When I attempted suicide, I felt like i was doing a selfless thing: I was ridding the world of the atrocity that is me. So I slit my wrist, and I am relatively sure that I did it right and the bleeding from my wrist would have killed me. My arm was getting numb and feeling heavy and I was getting light headed. It was because I stopped myself. I snapped out of it and immediately stopped the bleeding. I realized I may have made the wrong decision about  what I was doing, but shortly thereafter I started regretting stopping myself, and for the past month I have been very conflicted as to whether or not I did the right thing by stopping myself. Thankfully, things may be starting to work out again. I am now on medication (I was not before and I did not want any because of my very negative experience with prozac) and I will be receiving counseling, which my family and I have struggled to obtain. I think the worst *may* be behind me, and I am deeply sorry for those whom I have hurt because of what I did. |cut|bleed|drug

You should know that I am bipolar as well. Which means I will always cycle through deep depression. My first thought the morning after the first attempt was, 'why am I awake?'"" I was bitterly disappointed in myself for not being strong enough to make sure I was actually dying. I would tell myself that my existence was a terrible mistake that I needed to fix. That so much of my life had been awful and painfully lonely that it could not change. To make matters worse, I did not disclose my suicide attempt to my psychiatrist, I was afraid of being committed and having to go on heavier atypical antipsychotics. Don''t ignore your support system like I did. I was 19 at the time in the midst of an incredibly messed up, abusive relationship, and I almost missed out on every breathtaking moment of joy I have had since. My next suicide attempt is kind of hazy, I know it was mid June 2012, and I know that I did a significant amount of drugs to try to off myself and I remember telling my bf that I was dying and then I remember throwing up quite a bit and hoping it had been long enough that I would absorbed the pills anyways. It took me quite a while to feel better from that one. I think I even failed out of my classes, that semester. In the years since, I have ceased to continually demonize myself, my past actions and I try to focus on the future . I made a bucket list and self flagellated all over the place about the experiences I have yet to experience. I have checked off quite a few in the 6 years since my first attempt. Not nearly all, I hope I keep adding to the list throughout my life. Things that my psychiatrist said that changed me: Suicidal thoughts are not normal. It''s not normal to want to kill yourself every day, normal people do not do that. You are sick, and you cannot get better through force of will alone. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. If your life is so awful that you are looking to run away from your problems. Actually run away, go far away to a new place, find a better solution to nonexistence. Because there is no coming back from that one. So I ran away to the circus essentially and found a better place. Art therapy saved me more than the medications did, I am down to just the art now. And my reason for existence now? To leave the world slightly better than how I found it."""|drug
Several years ago, I attempted overdose.

I was not conscious for any of that.[BK][BK]I remember when I woke up, I was ravenous. I wanted nothing more than just goldfish and Pepsi, and kinda locked myself in a room to play Half-Life 2 for an hour or two. I just needed some sort of stability or normalcy — I was not sure how to process the fact that I was still around.[BK][BK]And then I went outside. Mind you, I had fully and entirely committed that I would not see stars again. I would not see green, or feel humid Florida air, or hear the breeze lazily whooshing through pine trees. I went outside, and it was like seeing color for the first time all over again. I just cried. I did not know why I was still around, and a large part of me was resentful that I had been saved.[BK][BK]But part of me was also just overwhelmed with the unending crystalline beauty of everything around me. And I mean EVERYthing: the humming of tires as traffic dinked about nearby was tied to bee-buzzings and a memory of a cello section from an orchestra rehearsal.

A little back story. I was a junior in high school, and had just told the girl who I was madly in love with that I liked her two weeks prior. She rejected me, claiming to have known that I liked her for a while, she just did not say anything about it because she liked the attention. Also, around this same time my grandfather went into the hospital, and my older brother was visiting home (my older brother is an all around asshole, but everyone loves him and treats me like crap when he is around).[BK][BK]Day before Christmas, I decided it was time to end it all, but I did not want to ruin everyone's Christmas. So I waited until the 26th, at three in the morning. I took about 10 painkillers and tried to drown myself in a bath tub by filling it with water and holding my head under the faucet so that if I struggled, I would hit the faucet and stay in the water. Must've lasted at least two minutes because I start to feel myself black out, but the pain in my chest became too much. I jerked my head back from the tub and gasped for air. The first thought I had was wishing that the girl I had liked and my brother could feel the pain I felt, and that my grandfather's pain would stop. Why should someone who is led a good life suffer while these selfish people get by okay?[BK][BK]No one found out about what happened that morning for months, and even today, very few people know about all of this. This is the way I want to keep it (hence the throwaway), so if you are reading this and know who I am, please refrain from posting any personal details about anyone.[BK][BK]Fast forward to today, where I am doing much better, enrolled in a good college, and studying hard. The girl I had liked and I are good friends, my grandfather passed away last August, and my brother and I still are not on talking terms, but that is another story.

Tried to overdose on prescription meds in college.  While my first conscious thought was not exactly positive, it later put things in perspective. I woke up on my bedroom floor, 2 days later. When I was finally able to move, I reached in my pocket to find my phone. (I did not realize 2 days had passed at this point). My first thought was the realization that not one person had reached out to see where I was. I had a group of friends, none of which knew about my personal issues because I kept them to myself and these were more or less friends that could be called bad influences. Even though I could not really blame them for not checking on me, I just found it demoralizing that not one person called or asked where I was or if everything was alright. But in that brief moment of loneliness and desperation, I realized I had more to live for and that I needed to find more positive people to hang around. I called my mother, moved home, later moved out of state to a new college. Now 2 years later, I have met people that are now my closest friends, I am in my last year of school, and dating the love of my life. |hang|drug

"I know I am late but I could really need some advice here.[BK](also this is a throawaway for obvious reasons)[BK][BK]My girlfriend attempted suicide after her first boyfriend treated her like shit when she was 15 years old (she is now 18) and she was not messing around. She took like 20-25 sleeping pills and went to bed expecting to never wake up again.[BK]Instead she woke up in the hospital and was told her parents brought her there after they heard her vomiting in her room, which she cannot even remember at all.[BK][BK]I met her last year and she told me about this about half a year ago.

Which...i can understand somewhat from her parents point of view, but still it makes her feel quite miserable at times when 'the walls have ears'"". She wants to leave home as soon as possible but since she will be at university for at least another 4-5 years with only a small part time job on the side it wont be as easy to support living on her own without her parents support. And she hates being dependent on them.[BK][BK]The thing is...I actually feel like most of this supposed '""control'"" of her parents is just in her head and based on guilt because of her suicide attempt. The first few months she told me she could not stay overnight because her parents would not allow it. But she never even asked them in the first place. And when she did they said: '""Sure go ahead'""[BK][BK]There were several of these moments where I got the feeling she is paranoid about her parents.

I was was buying supplies, Gorilla tape and big, very thick garbage bags. The plan was to wrap myself in one layer and then wrap a second one within it, in a shower, in the dark. Just remove a sensation at a time, let the shower keep the bag temperature comfortable, as I run out of air. Ultimately I did not do it and checked myself into a facility. I felt so weak. It was an incredibly dumb way to do it with plenty of points of failure. It was melodramatic.[BK][BK]I still feel like I failed, even with all the progress I made in life.

I untied the knot, took a looooong breath, the longest of my whole life. I stepped off the bench again and sat on a chair.[BK]and...I started laughing. like goddamn fucking crazy. like the Joker himself. I could not help it. at all.

I never said anything to my parents, even though in the following months I told the story to pretty much everyone I know, because I felt the compulsive need to share it to get it off my chest.[BK]I am not sure if this qualifies as an answer to your question, since the conscious thought happened before and not after my suicide attempt.[BK]but yeah...I always wanted to share it with some strangers on the internet, and maybe now it was the right time to do it, I do not know.[BK]now my life is better, in the end I sort of managed to solve my family's problems, even though it pretty much drained my mind and I had to stop my academic career for a while.[BK]I plan to resume it in the future, next year, or maybe not.[BK]but I feel fine, all things considered I managed to keep fighting pretty well after that episode, and most importantly, I am still here.[BK]never stop fighting, no matter the shit your life throws at you.[BK]never yield to circumstances.

Late to the party but oh well,[BK]I tried to overdose on a trip to Thailand last year. I got drunk on the room tab, went down to the street and bought some drugs from the shifty little pop-up stores that appear at night, and took them on my way back to the hotel, washed them down with vodka and a little mixer to make sure I would not throw up. I was feeling really emotional beforehand, as well as when I was back at the hotel wishing I could just die already, but actually planning it and going through with it was the most clarity I have ever experienced. I actually felt happy and excited that it was finally going to be over. I cut myself as well that evening, as well as writing to my best friend before I fell asleep.[BK]I woke up very late in the evening the next day, and just felt dread that I was still alive. The drugs had made me incredibly sleepy and my head felt so heavy I could barely move. I knew I now had to deal with the repercussions of what I would tried to do, how upset my friend was, and how the bloody sheets would be explained when I checked out. It was more of the fact that I felt frustrated that it would look like I was not serious, and that I had faked it like a teenage girl for attention. More and more things from the previous night started to come back to me, but all I wanted to do was just disappear still. I had wanted to die, not pointlessly upset and inconvenience everyone else. [BK][BK]Even now when things are finally better, the feelings and thoughts that led me to want to kill myself are still there, and I always wish I had died that night because then all the pain and suffering I will endure the rest of my life could have been avoided; the good parts are never really worth the bad parts. I have not wanted to kill myself since but I think that may be because I have not really been able to feel anything very strongly since; I am still sad, I am still happy, but never really passionately happy or devastated enough to try again yet.|cut|drug|alcohol

I was taken to the hospital in a helicopter, which I remember absolutely nothing of. [BK][BK]When I woke up, who knows how long later, my estranged dad was the only person there. I do not remember any conversation or even hugging or anything at all, just that he was there. It meant a lot, still. My dad had a tough upbringing with several suicide attempts of his own. He never had anyone to wake up to, and he wanted to make sure I never felt that. It''s a small moment I still cherish. I spent the next several weeks in a behavioral clinic with other kids of varying ages. A 13 year old girl who stole her grandma''s car, a seven year old who physically attacked her mom, biting, kicking, and most sad of all, a 5 year old boy who had tried to hang himself from a ceiling fan. There were plenty of others, anorexic girls, self mutilaters (myself included), repeat visitors, 'delinquents.'"" I never wanted to see another place like that. I finished my program, took my pills, tried to be happy. [BK][BK]My Grampa had a heart attack a few months later and needed a quadruple bypass. I was so numbed on these meds, I was unable to respond with appropriate emotions, or any emotions at that. I decided that day to stop taking my medications. I worked hard to get my head in a stable place, but I got there. Some years later, I had a psychological evaluation that determined I had been misdiagnosed several times over and under treated for the actual problem I had. So, I had spent years on all kinds of medications that I knew were fucking me up, and they turned out to be completely unnecessary.[BK][BK]It will be ten years since that attempt in just a few months. I have been with my husband for 7 of those years. We have two daughters together, one is three and one is a month old. My battles with depression have never gone away, but life has value to me and I will not stop trying to get better. This year, I am hoping to find medications that actually do something helpful for me. I desperately want to be well."""|hang|drug|drown
I tried to OD & my husband who had been asleep caught & stopped me. [BK][BK]Before I just knew I had to die. I was so ready. It felt like a dream almost where there was this calm chaos. I was just taking pill after pill and knew that this was it, the end. I had completely given up & was drained of any energy.[BK][BK]But when he stopped me it kindof snapped me back to reality. There was this strange mix of relief and yet despair. I did not really want to die I just needed the pain to go away.[BK][BK][BK]Then I spent the next two days nonstop throwing up... & being in the absolute worst pain of my life. seriously do not try to overdose. :( |drug
I woke up in the hospital after overdosing. Almost died, I was actually pretty close. At one point before I blacked out, the nurses were trying to force me to drink liquid charcoal to absorb the pills I took, because some of them shut down my gag reflex. Not sure if my stomach was pumped. Never asked.[BK][BK]I woke up feeling aimless and hopeless. I had no idea what direction to go in after that. I had to stay in an in-patient mental health unit for a couple of weeks. I was borderline catatonic. I did not really eat, sleep, move, talk. Everything just felt fucking pointless. I was sad that my one (supposedly) guarenteed out had failed. I did not know how to pick up the pieces of my life that I had fucked up, and I  was terrified of facing the people I hurt emotionally. I remember my parents were really pissed off at first. They lectured me, but then they softened up and realized the level of desperation I felt. I was around 15, if I remember correctly. That was one of my five hospital visits that resulted in admission to the unit.|drug|alcohol

I am 24 and female. I swallowed pills and laid down waiting to drift into my eternal slumber. When I woke up I was covered in my own vomit and was incredible dehydrated. I laid on the floor thoughtless for what seemed like hours. I felt like an empty vessel and I was filled with a deep sadness that I could not accomplish the simple task of ending my own life; I slipped back into a deep sleep and when I woke the second time I was greeted by a cat (I did not own a cat at the time). The cat purred and laid on my chest and together we just laid there waiting for the energy that comes with life to fill my lungs. Eventually I stood, cleaned myself up, showered and it is then I realized the seriousness of what happened. Never before had I attempted suicide and as I reflected on my suicidal actions I began to feel sick, ill. My legs gave out and I fell in the shower and began sobbing. After my shower I slept for two full days, hardly eating or sleeping. When I woke up I felt reborn. My life changed drastically and I began advocating for myself. The abuse I experienced as a child seemed conquerable and I took the first deep breath I have taken since being birthed into Earth's atmosphere. I felt no shame, I felt no obligation to others, I felt grounded in myself. A gift no counsellor or therapist could have ever given me. I felt strong and for the first time ever I began to understand myself and my existence. Suicide and I danced a tango and thankfully the dance did not lead to my death, but to a new beginning. I am still struggling with my mental wellbeing and the past abuse I have encountered haunts me, but it does get easier... Slowly, but it does. |drug
"'I should not have chickened out'""[BK]I have bipolar disorder, and I got really fucking sick of insane mania and crippling depression. I tried to get help, but literally no doctor wanted to treat me.[BK]So, Injected myself with an entire bottle of insulin, and took a sleeping pill. I started getting the shakes, and I had this nagging thought that I was going to become a vegetable, I saw my niece who was under a year old at the time, and I freaked out and told someone. The ambulance got there really quickly, like under ten minutes. I live in a nice area. [BK][BK]The next like 2 or 3 days I was in the ICU having my blood sugar tested every half hour or hour or something, and getting injected with sugar and forced to eat sugar. It sucked and my fingers were bruised and squeezed dry by the end of it. There was a nurse there who was really nice to me though, that kindness really meant something to me, like maybe not all of humanity totally sucks.

It was much later in the evening after I got home that I realized that death , while still alluring, was not what I wanted. I was still woefully depressed, so depressed that I honestly felt my family would not care if I died and I really had no desire for life but...as I looked at my bandaged wrist I did not feel like suicide was the right choice for me.

I tried twice and failed. I am 16, and I tried last year and the year before, both around september/october. I took every pill I could find, including tons of benadryl so I could pass out and never wake up. I sat in my bed, and started crying because I was so afraid... I told my parents and they took me to the ER and everything. I had to stay at the hospital for a couple of days. Those days were incredibly painful, not just because of the after effects of the pills metabolizing in my body. The next time I tried, I cut my legs fairly deep, and took even more pills than I had before. A year had passed since last time, and this time I took a whole bottle of Ibuprofen, sleeping pills, and every pill I could possibly find (again). I barely remember what even happened, except for when my parents were trying to put my limp body in the car, and police, and an ambulance. It's all kind of vague still. I woke up in the ER again, and then after that they put me in a psych ward for a week. It was torture in there. The worst feelings I have ever felt in my life were in a locked room, alone, in a corner, crying... I do not even like to think about it. Now I am here, on tons of antidepressants, and always being watched. Haven't finished a year of school in two years, and now I am trying to get my shit together, and figure out why I am on this earth, and what I should do. |cut|drug
I was 15 at the time, the week after I was in the psychiatric ward. I turned 16 when I was  in there. [BK][BK]When I tried to kill myself I took multiple handfuls of pills. All that I could find, but it mostly it consisted of advil and iron supplements (for my anemia). Then I drank till I could not stand up, laid in the shower puking and cutting. I ended with a double digit blood alcohol level and almost lost my liver from the toxicity of the iron and alcohol. Its lucky I survived. [BK][BK]When I finally sobered up by the next afternoon I just stared at the wall while my parents talked at me and cried. I hated myself. I could not get fucking suicide right. I felt blank.  I was in shock (or catatonic?) for a few days. Im better now. But waking up and knowing you failed life and on top of that failed suicide, makes you leave the world and withdraw into your mind|bleed|drug|alcohol
Honestly? It was the fact I survived. I was heartbroken, devastated. Not because of the people I hurt, but because I still hurt and I was still there when I did not want to be anymore. I could not understand what I did to deserve to still be here when I just wanted it all to end. I thought all those pills I swallowed would end me and they did not.[BK][BK]I am only 21, but after a traumatic childhood and the revelation months earlier before my suicide attempt that I was Bipolar, I did not want to be there anymore. I was tired of being strong and believing and hoping that it would get better in time when I had been hoping that for years. This happened 4 months ago.[BK][BK]It was very difficult to deal with in the aftermath because I realized it did not fix anything and I really scared the people close to me. And it was not an option for me anymore. And that was terrifying because Suicide was always looked at by me as that 'friend' who would be there still if I could not take it anymore. And I no longer had that, because I survived. [BK][BK]The experience itself changed my life for better or worse because it was the first time I had actually TRIED and nearly succeeded when I had never acted on the thoughts before that moment in time. [BK][BK]I do not know what kept me here, but I am happy I stuck around because life has finally started to shape into the way I wanted it to be. It's still unpredictable, my mental illness (which by the way, turned out to be co-morbid with Borderline Personality Disorder as well) is never going to go away, and I need to address incidents of the past in therapy...but I am truly feeling as if I can forgive the past for hurting me so much and move on and look at the present more.|disease|drug
When I woke up from overdosing on every pill I had in the house (I created an overdose basket and put it under my sink in preparation for another low), I felt angry that my mother was in the same room because we did not have a relationship at that time and I did not understand why she was there. I was angry that I was hooked up to machines. I remember getting up at one point and going to the bathroom against the doctors orders. Im not usually angry and Im not usually defiant. [BK][BK]After the dizziness and anger wore off, I was extremely sad. Sadder than I ever was. I felt like I failed and living, and also failed at dying. I wanted to die so much. At the point I was in, thinking about dying was the only thing that made me smile. I tried to negotiate my way out of hospital care but I was stuck.[BK][BK]I got out of the hospital early because my insurance did not approve the stay. They offered to let me transfer to a different facility or release me to see a counselor daily. Of course I elected to leave. I should have went to the other facility.[BK][BK]I went home to an empty house and I was lost. I tried to overdose again but just fell asleep and woke up much later. I figured if I had to live, I needed to learn how to do it.[BK][BK]I was assigned a psychiatrist that did not really treat me. She gave me way to many prescriptions and did not choose to listen. I gave up going to her and tried to just learn to be happy.[BK][BK]Here I am, 8 years later, now going to therapy and finally recovering. I know looking back, my progress stalled because I didnt take the right steps to getting better. I needed to create a web of support and the right kind of support for me. Im still going through highs and lows, but its been about 4 years since my last attempt. Ive found things to live for and Im starting to love myself.[BK][BK]It isnt easy, and it isnt fun at times. I catch myself planning things around the house or putting limits on how long Im going to live. Im married now and he is very understanding without accepting. His brother recently committed suicide so I was able to see how the pain transfers. It has been one of the hardest things we have gone through together. [BK][BK]Please reach out. If you dont like your therapist, try a new one that may fit your needs better. Never give up on yourself. |drug
When I was about 16 I decided to take every pill in the house. I was choking them down by the handful and chased it down with some nyquil so I would fall asleep before I started to vomit. [BK][BK]I remember my dad called before I started to fight the sleep, and slurring that I was glad the I got to talk to him but I had to go now. [BK][BK]Obviously I woke up the next morning, and my first thoughts were terrible. I felt like I was such a failure the I could not even kill myself right. Then I felt incredibly stupid because what I had taken was not even close to lethal. Some 75 advil, a package of dramamine and a blister pack full of little red pills, I should have chugged the drano under the sink instead. [BK][BK]My mom took me to the doctor that morning because my friend told the school what I would done, and I was not given a moments privacy for a while, so I obviously did not go back to correct my mistakes.[BK][BK]I am glad for it now, my life is not great but it is what I got. [BK][BK]Especially now. My older brother died 2 years ago, and my dad does not know how close he came to having me kill myself 12 years ago. I thought I would be less of a burden if I went but after my brother's death, which was not a suicide, I would know that I would haunt this family for fucking ever. [BK][BK]|drug
I am not a suicide survivor but I saved someone attempting to commit suicide. I was out for a fun with a friend and we saw a gentleman lying  under some trees. There is always an assumption that it will be a drunk person but we checked it out anyway and he had fastened a cord around his neck and was clearly asphyxiating. His lips were blue, eyes bulging, was twitching, he had clearly been crying and was in a bad way. I tried to remove the cord while my friend phoned an ambulance but it was digging deep into his neck so I cut it off with a penknife. As he came to he started fighting me, he really did not want the cord taking off. His first thought was that he wanted to be left alone to die. When he slowly started to come around properly he tried to get up and run away but could not stand and I had to gently restrain him (he was so weak a hand on the shoulder was enough). [BK][BK]I kept talking to him while we waited for help to arrive and when he finally filly regained consciousness he was ashamed and embarrassed at what he had done and kept apologising profusely for letting us see him this way. For me the most depressing part came afterwards, he was whizzed away in an ambulance and we never founs out how he was or what happened to him.[BK][BK]It was the day after Father's Day so that may have had something to do with his suicide attempt but I do not think we will ever know. I am just glad we were running along a deserted bit of the river at the time or he would have died without a doubt.|cut|hang|alcohol
Im 20, I have been thru a lot in life. Going through four suicides my senior year of high school. I have lost 6 people to suicide. October 31st 2015, i was supposed to go camping with some friends, I was not going to go to the party. I had this gut wrenching feeling something bad was going to happen. But al my friends ditched me and I went to that party. I find happiness when I drink and i needed some that night. I told myself I am just gonna drink as much as possible because i do not care what can happen. I woke up in the hospital, the medics said they thought i was dead arriving on the scene. I still sometimes wish to this day that i would have just died. Its always in the back of my mind on a daily basis. I try my best to stay afloat. My car an 88 gl10 subaru sedan is really the only thing that has been keeping me alive. Im a subaru ambassador so I got that gong for me. It still sucks though never knowing exactly when this depression shit is gonna just quit. It'd be cool to just have someone that knows exactly what it feels like to lose your aunt or friend to suicide all within a couple months apart. Its been two years since my aunts suicide and I have yet to bring myself to go visit her at her grave. I want to so bad but I just cannot. Ive been telling myself that Im alright but truly I am still broken.... |alcohol
"I took 97, 50 mg sleeping pills.  I was ready to go and be done with all the sadness that my heart just could not handle anymore.  I spent 3 days on a ventilator as my lungs and kidneys stopped working.  And for 3 days the Dr.''s asked my family if they wanted to pull the plug because they did not believe I would wake up.  Each time my family said, 'No, he is going to wake up!'"".  And then I did.  Outwardly I was so sorry for what I put everyone thru.  They were all so sad and shocked and did not know what to think and so glad that I was still here.  But truthfully, my first thought was, '""Why am I still here?'"".  By all rights I should be dead.  I do not want to be here.  Why? I went to counseling and did a lot of soul searching and about 6 months ago it was revealed to me why I was still here.  I am a singer/songwriter and I knew that I had the opportunity to speak for those who did not have such a platform.  So I decided to write a song about suicide.  Then I decided to make a music video for suicide prevention.  I can relate to every person who has ever thought about suicide or even tried it.  I have been there and I made it.  And most importantly, I overcame it.  I am still here and I get to help other people, just like me, every single day.  It gets better, I promise you that.  To anyone on the fence, sit and talk with me awhile.  I will not blow smoke up your butt, the answers are NEVER easy.  It''s NOT the cowards way out.  But there is a better way.  We are each gifted and so special in our own ways, we just need to recognize that our value is not based on upon other peoples perceptions of our worth.

"'Fuck.'""[BK][BK]The same thing i said every morning I woke up.[BK][BK]I was a very belligerent drunk. I was in a real dark place and drank myself to blackout every night for three months. Sometimes I would hope that in my drunken state, I would take my life. There was numerous times that I woke up to messages from friends saying they were worried about me because I was in a state of madness and was cursing allowed, yelling about how fucked up my head was and that I was going to kill myself.[BK][BK]One night I had enough. There was a few events that took place that day that pushed a bit further than before. From what I remember I had 5 jager bombs, and a pitcher of beer. I was with two coworkers playing pool and thankfully they looked after me, even though I was being selfish and making a scene.

I had an acquaintance from high school try to kill himself by shooting himself in the chest. The round squibbed, meaning it misfired and the round was stuck in the barrel. He assumed because he saw a bit of smoke and heard a quiet pop, that he was dying and was euphoric since he did not feel anything. Nope, round failed to do anything. He realized what happened and instead of being angry, was relieved and decided he wanted to live rather than his mom come home and find his body in a pool of blood. He cleared the squibbed round, cleaned the gun and called a doctor.

"'Why did I stop'"" [BK][BK]Shortly after realizing that I had survived my suicide attempt, I tried to better myself by reading book and playing video games. But that did not last very long. [BK][BK]About two months later after my first suicide attempt, I tried to do it again for personal reasons. And those reasons I did not have control over. I was alone through the whole trip. I did not have anyone. I was not a complete loner, I had friends that I would socialize with and hang out with, but none of them knew how I was truly feeling. [BK][BK]After my third attempt, I decided to tell one of my close friends that I have attempted suicide on three different occasions. She just laughed and said, '""do not be a bitch, grow a pair'"" after that I became more revert. I stopped hanging out, I stopped going out to parties. I was completely alone. I had no idea what to do, I did not know what to do. I gave myself support for all these years and thoughtout high school I made, maybe two more suicide attempts. [BK][BK]Shortly after my freshman year of high school, I met a girl that helped me cope with all this pain and she understood everything.

"I attempted to kill myself by using a knife and cutting open my stomach. I am guessing whereever I stabbed did not cause enough damage to actually kill me or make me faint from blood loss and just die from lack of blood.

They found me in my bathroom covered in blood still shouting the same thing over and over and called an ambulance.

"'I am sorry'""[BK][BK]I am not a sociable person. I keep small friend groups to avoid drama, and to not disappoint a lot of people when I move after community college. In a result of this, I have had a total of five really close friends. Everyone else in my eyes was an ''acquaintance'' of some sort, someone that I just ''Knew''. I would not think twice about having a personal conversation with them. [BK][BK]I had lost my last good friend to a car accident. To add onto that? Every single one of them died from car accidents within a three year span, all in the same general area, all due to high speed leading to fishtailing. [BK][BK]None of the other deaths affected me. I was genially worried after the third of five close friends passed without me shedding a single tear. This lead to Insomnia, which led to my doctor prescribing me sleep aid, as well as referring me to a therapist. [BK][BK]I tried overdosing on sleeping pills. Not to an extreme amount, but still enough to where I had a possibility of dying in my sleep (I do not remember much of the previous few hours of taking them, so I could not tell you the exact amount). I decided if I woke up still alive, it was a sign to keep pushing through life. [BK][BK]When I woke up the day after, everything seemed a lot brighter than usual. Not brighter like the sun was out without clouds, but like if you were to play a video game and turn the contrast and brightness way too high. I assumed this was the afterlife, but due to me not having any religious views, I did not know what would happen. None of that mattered though, because the only thing I could think about was how sorry I was. [BK][BK]I had family, and no matter the fact I isolated myself from most of them, they all loved me. If I was dead, they would not have spoken to me since my graduation of high school. These ''Acquaintances'' I had thought of themselves more than that to me. Although I did not believe it, they did care about me. Worst of all was that I had refused to communicate with my mother for the past three months. For what reason? I have no idea. One day I just decided I was tired of hearing her voice, and just stopped making effort to communicate with her. [BK][BK]Eventually, I did come to me senses, and the ''brightness'' went down. I realized I was still in my room (although for some reason I was on the floor), and I got up oddly feeling normal. My life did not flash through my eyes, and I did not meet god or anything. I got ready for classes, and went to them. [BK][BK]Although nothing noteworthy besides the sorry thoughts happened, I took in a lot from those thoughts. That day I went to my mothers house and spent the day with her, and have been doing that weekly. I have reached out to small friends and have developed relationships with them, even starting dating someone.[BK][BK]That all happened six months ago. I did not talk to my councilor about it, and when my doctor asked why I needed a refill so early on my sleep aid, I told him I accidentally lost half the bottle down the drain. The whole event stayed in the back of my mind till this thread came up, which I took as an opportunity to share my experience. I want everyone to know that suicide is not the answer. There are always people who you can reach out to, and always a solution. A temporary problem should not be solved by a permanent fate. [BK][BK]Stay strong everyone!"""|cut|drug|vehicle
For me my thoughts were moving too quick to really pick out any one thought.  If anything I would say the first feeling was a bit of soul crushing relief knowing that the pressures of my life had just passed me by.

Sometimes unable to even hold a pencil. Sometimes unable to walk. I had very little direct control over my muscles by that point. Taken to ER twice for what appeared to be a seizure.

I think being in a suicide facility shut out from everyone you know is the worst part of my attempt though and being roomed with a woman who reminded me and favored my grandmother who passed away two years prior was torture Alone.

For those who suffer from depression as I did for over a decade, there is hope! [MAPS](http://www.maps.org/research) is working with the FDA doing clinical trials with various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, Ibogaine, and Ayahuasca, for use with psychotherapy in order to treat a variety of psychological and emotional problems including PTSD, trauma, anxiety, depression, and addiction. These trails have been working extremely well with success rates higher than that of traditional treatments.

I have tried commuting suicide several times. Once after I was molested when I was a kid; I drank some bleach and my father found me on the floor and took me to the hospital. I thought I did not drink enough so try something else. Second time was via me taking a bunch of pills. I passed out and woke up with my gut feeling horrific. Third time was after I moved back home for a little bit. I had a gun and decided that would be the most effective way to do it, so loaded it and pulled the trigger. Gun had jammed. My sister came home and I did not want to do it with her there so I put it away. Eventually got rid of it. It's seven years later and I still think about suicide frequently.

I have anxiety, depression, and very bad bipolar disorder and it is very hard to deal with, even with therapy, a loving family and friend group, and multiple medications.

I thought I was a hindrance to everyone I knew and it was better if I died. I swallowed my newly refilled bottle of venlafaxine pills and lied down. I fell asleep instantly.

I will have to try again later.'""[BK][BK]I somehow managed to stagger into the shower and get dressed. Couldn''t speak, and had a hell of a time getting down the stairs. I had previously ended up in the hospital after taking 16 Coricidin HBP cold and cough pills. (Wasn''t trying to kill myself at the time, it was recreational.) Since that had *almost* killed me before, I figured that 32 of those and and 72 Tylenol would do the trick. I cannot describe just how beaten I felt at that moment. I mean fuck, I could not even *die* right. [BK][BK]I will not get into the explicit details, but after getting out of the hospital I spent the better part of 1 1/2 years in residential psych care. Apparently they did not really know what to do with someone who broke down their reasoning for suicide the way I did.[BK][BK]It''s always been a pretty simple equation in my mind. If the sum of my negative and neutral experiences has greater weight than the value of my positive experiences, it was my preference to not exist, rather than to exist. There is no meaning or purpose to life beyond that which the person experiencing it assigns to it. If the person experiencing life feels there is no value in it, then there is no reason to continue experiencing it.[BK][BK]It''s been 15 years since then, and I still hold that opinion. My experience with life has been amusing at best, and pretty horrible at worst. I have obligations to meet and promises to keep though, so I continue to wake up in the morning. Do I have depression? Certainly. But I have been dealing with that for twenty years or so, I can deal with it a few more. Who knows, maybe I will find something worth living for.[BK][BK]Finally, if *you* are feeling depressed or suicidal, talk to someone. It may just help. My understanding is that for many people medication, therapy or trusted friends can help. You owe it to yourself to give it a shot. If it is an event or series of events that has made you consider ending things, try giving it some time. Cliché as it sounds, time does make the pain fade. It sucks. I know, I have spent a long time there. I have also had friends that have been there and now seem truly happy. It''s possibly the most important decision you can possibly make, so at least take the time to consider it properly.[BK][BK]Since this post has gone on for longer than I planned, thanks to those of you that read it and I hope it provided some form of insight.

Never shared the full story with anyone, but here goes:[BK][BK]In 2012 I was diagnosed with a neuro-degenerative illness and was told there are only a few dozen active recorded cases, and in past cases some patients have gotten something called [Morvan's Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morvan%27s_syndrome) which leads to fatal insomnia.[BK][BK]I was hospitalized for a month because my lung function was severely affected by the illness for a short time and I developed dementia and what appeared to be hallucinations (I do not remember most of my time at the hospital). Even then I was getting pretty decent sleep, so Morvan's syndrome was not on my radar until doctors told me it could become a real possibility (the EEG's showed I was getting very little REM sleep). Thankfully my lung function started to improve and I was released from the hospital, and went back to work. I was also given a drug called oxcarbazapine to help with the muscle issues.[BK][BK]About 2 months after getting released from the hospital I started sleep walking. And really really walking. I lived alone and would open the door in my sleep, and walk off into the city. I would usually find myself somewhere a mile or two away, and my legs would be in extreme pain, like I had been running. Needless to say it was pretty terrifying and I was basically getting no sleep.[BK][BK]This had been going on for a couple of weeks, and I was still going to work, and one Friday a work friend I had known for years asked me if I wanted to play games with a group of friends that night, and I said yes. When I got there I met my friend at the door and then slowly began talking to other people as they talked to me, and then I introduced myself by name to one guy and he laughed and said he knew who I was, and that we had all hung out together the weekend before... I had absolutely no memory of this, and I started to feel really fucking confused and nauseous and drove home. Later that night I woke up in a lawn with the sprinklers going... I was about a mile from my house. Sleep deprived, confused, and angry I walked back to my house and downed ALL of my pills.[BK][BK]Less than 20 minutes later I was hurling... and because my muscles are fucked up, some of it started aspirating into my lungs... I fucking panicked and called 911. The fire station was about 2 blocks from my house, and it felt like they were there in seconds, I did not even have to open the door... I just looked up and there were people in my house and I could see red lights flashing through the window.[BK][BK]They took me to the hospital, and started to give me some sludge stuff to drink that was supposed to keep me from absorbing much more... it was awful, and I was vomiting and aspirating a bit more, and I told them to stop. And the nurses kept doing it, but a doctor came in and told them to stop because the drug I had taken was not very potent in overdoses and because he did not think pumping my stomach would help because I would be okay.[BK][BK]The first thought was not thankfulness or hope, or anything like that... Instead I can only describe it as being entirely in the moment. Like nothing else mattered outside of the now, there was no work, no relationships, no responsibilities. I just felt very alive and conscious of everything that was going on.[BK][BK]I stayed there overnight and half of the next day before getting released. Initially they said I would be there at least three days, but the afternoon after the night I was admitted a doctor came in smiling and said he had good news. He said he had spoken to someone about the oxcarbazapine drug I was taking, and that person told him that a very very small percentage of people taking it start sleepwalking. He told me to stop taking it, and said the nurses would bring me paperwork to discharge me and give me numbers to call if I again felt the way I had when I had been admitted.[BK][BK]It's been 4 years now, and while I still have major issues with the neurodegenerative illness, I have never had sleepwalking problems again since stopping my prescription for the drug.[BK][BK]**TL;DR:** My initial thoughts before knowing I would be okay were a feeling of being in a totally surreal place and disconnected from life... and then that transitioned into very 'in the moment' thoughts and feelings when I learned I was not successful.

There were just these endless tears that would roll down my cheeks. Even then I felt like an empty vessel. I still did not feel very much alive at all and mostly just detached from everyone and everything. I was watching the world in third person through a gray filter. I wanted to leave the hospital and rip out the IV in my arm, but I was honestly also too exhausted to fight anyone. There was always someone watching me from outside the room in the hospital. They would come in to check on me from time to time. At one point she asked me why I was crying and all I could respond was '""I do not know.'"" Since I live out of state for college, my parents could not come to the hospital in person, but it broke my heart to hear how much I hurt them when I spoke to them on the phone. It broke my heart to see how much I hurt my closest friends. It changed the reality of what I had originally thought to be the truth but it was really just a delusion that my depression wanted me to believe in.

"I was depressed for as long as I can remember. I was bullied by everyone around me and my parents were even worse. By the time I was 10 I had had enough.

[BK]So while I was in the kitchen doing dishes one night I waited until both of my parents left the room and I quickly grabbed a bottle of something and shoved it in my pocket without looking.[BK][BK]I had to wait until everyone went to sleep.

I had laboured breathing as I was slowly drifting away. I would smoke Fentanyl gel from a piece of foil, more and more as I drifted out.

I am not quite sure. Mostly I had to make up a story to explain what happened to the fire fighters, police and emts.

Can't sleep, so I might as well contribute. Although I was not able to ACTUALLY go through with it, I attempted suicide twice in middle school. I was generally hated, and suffered from extreme OCD, and had not had my meds fully worked out. The constant bullying, anger, and hurt never helps. Even today, I still suffer from OCD and depression, which amplify each other. Since middle school, I have forgotten much of what happened, and even I have even forgotten most of the details of my two attempts. I did learn that even if I did it, it would be a million times worse for those who cared about me. Even as depressed as I get today (which does not help after major spine surgery), I do not consider suicide an option. I could not hurt my family and friends like that. For those of you who are thinking about it, do not. It can get better. Although I am still not exactly fantastic, I can get through the pain. You can too. Fuck, I was like ten or eleven when I got through most of it. If a middle schooler who cannot grasp the concept of how others care about them made it, you can too. Stay strong.|disease

One day, after a terrible day at school, I came home and just....could not deal with it anymore. I took out the 25 packets I had saved up over a few months, tore them open and swallowed them all.

I never got to attempt it, but I was days away from potentially trying.

Probably not the usual instant regret story. After taking a bottle of anti-anxiety meds and washing them down with a bottle of vodka, my husband (boyfriend at the time) called an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital. My best friend was by my side, and although I cannot remember anything she told me I kept crying and saying I wish I had died. [BK][BK]The rest is also sort of blurry. I remember having to call my parents and tell them what had happened. At the time I was ashamed and could not get the words out when my mom picked up. I asked for my twin sister, who then relayed the message to my parents. She told me after I sounded like a stranger, I was talking at half the normal speed and was slurring so much I was near unintelligible.[BK][BK]After convincing my family not to drive five hours to see me, I guess I passed out for a few more hours. I was in and out of consciousness while they flushed my system.[BK][BK]When I was disharged from the hospital, I was taken to the Waterford (mental hospital) where I waited for what seemed like forever (this is the same day, late at night now). After talking to a psychologist for a couple of hours I was deemed stable enough to go home for some reason. (he told me I was depressed, duh, with borderline tendencies) I think at this point my speech was still slurred, I definitely was not in my right mind. But for some reason I was not kept overnight.[BK][BK]So after about 16 hours I crawled back into my bed, same bedroom where I had decided to end my life. I felt exhausted, ashamed, guilty, and scared. I felt this way for days afterwards, but only relieved I was unsuccessful for the sake of my loved ones. That feeling was mixed with guilt.[BK][BK]Two years of recovery later and I still have recurring nightmares. Not an experience I am willing to repeat. But if I am being completely honest with myself, what I went through only made me determined not to fuck up if I tried again. Luckily, I have no desire to do so in the immediate future, as I am in a good place right now mentally.|vehicle

Funny how I had just tried to kill myself but I woke up wishing I had not because... needles. It made me realize that I did not actually want to die, but my brain and my illness led me to do so.[BK][BK]Mental illness is something I wish more people would understand. We want to die because some of our minds are too loud and we want peace and quiet just once. Or forever. What our brain makes us believe is that we are trapped and that we will never escape this ''noise''. But things eventually do quiet down, it just requires patience, time, and ultimately, willpower.

Then, my parents came sprinting upstairs and my dad told me to go pack a bag, so we could go to the hospital.

I woke up really confused and tried to remember what I was just doing; hanging myself. [BK][BK]I was 19 and was 6 months into sobriety after rehab, living with a minister who was a second mom to me. She and her husband were on a cruise and her older son was celebrating his birthday that day. I decided that the world had given up on me, breaking up with my addict boyfriend is what I needed to do... And could not handle it.[BK][BK]I called my then boyfriend and he was so upset he told me not to tell anybody and that he could help me. I knew he was wrong and that was not love.[BK]I called my councillor from rehab/my addictions group and she literally drove across town and took me to the hospital. I had purple marking all around my neck, skinned my spine along something when the rope I hung myself with broke while I was unconscious. [BK]We decided going back to rehab for 3 months was the best, and I had no neck injuries from my hanging. [BK][BK]I am not going to say it was easy, I broke up with that boyfriend, stayed single for over a year, worked on my recovery, and attended what I had always wanted in college: animation. [BK][BK]It is now 3 years later in my sobriety and almost 3 years since, and I start my final year of animation in September. I am also dating a wonderful and truly loving man who is not afraid to tell me the truth and helps me best he can; with REAL love. I have a fantastic relationship with my rehab group, family, and the minister whom I lived with. I sometimes have hard days but am moving farther away from thoughts of suicide because I really truly cannot bear to hurt the people I love so much in my life today.[BK][BK]Please do not give up!

When the pills started to kick in, I remember thinking:[BK][BK]- Regret that a) I tried at all, and b) trying at night.

The very first thing I remember is waking up and shaking in the middle of the night. I could not control it and I just hoped I would go back to sleep and the pills would take effect. The next morning I woke up and the first thing I did was start to cry. It had been another thing I failed at, another thing I was not good enough at doing. It just further solidified to me that I was a fuck up.[BK][BK]That day was pretty rough for me - I went to school and acted like nothing happened and during my free period called a suicide hotline. Honestly, it took a lot of will and strength not to try again that night and I am happy I did not. Basically, the way I looked at it was I would hit rock bottom. This was going to be my lowest low and there would not be anything that would make me feel worse, so I may as well give life another shot. [BK][BK]This was about 7 years ago now and I have put my suicidal thoughts behind me, but it was a struggle. My first psychiatrist diagnosed me as bipolar and I was on the wrong medication up until college when I had to take a medical leave my second semester and finally saw a new doctor when I got home. [BK][BK]A couple years ago I got off anti-depressants entirely and I think that is something people do not really realize you can do (I know my mom did not understand it). Sure, it is not for everyone, but in my case I was in a completely different situation at the time of my attempt and the worst of my depression. When I got off my meds I was probably 5 years older, going to college, around a new group of people, even in a different state. To me, it was worth it to go through a monitored withdrawal to see if I could function normally without them. That said, there is nothing wrong with people who do need to continue to take them for longer periods of time.|drug

It was more of a I cannot believe I did that, I should be punished moment than a clear cut I want to die moment. I had meant to slap my ex. Our daughter was right beside him. I pulled my hand back to slap him. I was really pissed off. In rage, my hand turned into a fist. He moved our daughter to the area the fist was aiming for. I almost hit her instead. I stopped myself just in time. [BK][BK]He said he was going to call the cops and report me for abuse. I was freaking out and took the pills. I guess I really did not want to die. A couple minutes later, I told him what I had done. He took our daughter to our neighbors and drove me to the hospital. After my stomach was pumped, my first thoughts were I never want to do this again. I felt that way though because I hated the pump. Not a pleasant experience. That scared me enough to never do it again. Once I was thinking more clearly, I realized I did not want to die because I did not want my daughter to live with the knowledge her mother killed herself.|cut|drug
"'I am such a fucking idiot'""[BK][BK]I jumped in front of a car, but I was too scared to really do it properly. I went early, and the car slowed down enough that I was not seriously hurt. I got up straight away and ran, just felt like such an idiot and was really glad I was okay only because the guy in the car did not deserve to suffer the consequences of my actions. Then I just really hated myself because I knew I was too afraid to every take my own life, that I was going to have to keep living because i was scared. Then how unfair everything was, that I was feeling this while the people that caused it where living happily. [BK][BK]So I pretty much decided to live to spite the people that caused me so much pain. Had a lot of anger at the time and I manage to use it to keep me going. When I got home my mum got a bit of a shock, I was pretty good at playing pretend until that night. My mum realized what a bad state I was in and took me to get help. Probably not the best way to go about it but it worked and I have gotten a lot better since."""|jump
That time when I was 8 years old trying to slit my throat because I had enough of everyone bullying me and parents arguing and fighting everyday.

"'OH MY GOD! Weenie and piglet almost got hit by the truck! I need to save them!'""[BK][BK]Seriously, I have not watch much about weenie the pooh or read much, but that is the first and only hallucination I had after overdosing my dad''s high blood pressure pills at 16.[BK][BK]Comparing to others, I feel like I attempted for the most ridiculous reason, which was I am so insecure about my parents'' feelings to me, or I was so NEEDY. They were decent parents, just busy with work constantly. (both programmers...) I have only been to a park and a zoo with them during my childhood, and every summer in elementary school, I got sent to my babu''s place, and they rarely called since they were busy with work.[BK][BK] They provide me with everything except for emotional communications. They are not incapable of showing affection, because during family get-togethers, they always play and care for my cousins, and would even gift them novelties that I never had. (Well... mostly just small stuff like Japanese candies/chocolates they bought as souvenirs when they were on business trips, and I was spoiled so much that I took my parents'' money, that had been spent on xboxes, play stations, psps, overseas vacations or other things I wanted, for granted, but still... I failed to realise that and got so jealous about their affection towards my cousins.) And I was constantly trying to get their praise and approval, so stressed out that I would had depression from junior high to half way through high school. [BK][BK]Struggling to get out of bed to save piglet (frankly weenie died in my hallucination), I vomited uncontrollably on the ground, and my mom heard and rushed to my room, and called off work to took care of me the whole night and the following three months since the overdoes had some side effects on me...had a fever for about a week, and then pneumonia, which I guess it is caused by the fever, and then my left ear started to act up.. cannot hear things at times, so went to see the doctor and ended up having a paracentesis tympani.[BK][BK]But I was glad besides the hospital visits for physical health problems, my parents did not miss to recognize my mental illness, and acted in time to book a really good psychiatrist for our family, and we did counseling for about a year, talking through a lot of things, solving the problems in our family.

Took me almost an hour to get out of the tub, clean myself up, and crawl into the hotel bed. I felt light-headed for almost two weeks.[BK][BK]I am doing a bit better since then, probably thanks to finally going on Zoloft, but when I look back at the whole mess, all I can remember is that before passing out I was not afraid.

It was really weird because while in the process of trying, I had pseudo convinced myself I was not trying.  Like, I was telling my brain I was just taking all these pills to see what happened.

I started laughing. The rope I had tried to use was way too weak. My dad had always said I was no good at tying knots. I guess he was right. I sat down and looked at my shoes for about 15 minutes. [BK][BK]It was so surreal, building the last God only knows how many months of depression into one conscionable action that would decide my fate, and to fail that action created quite a cognitive dissonance in my life. It was not the end of my depression and it was not the end of my suicidal thoughts but it was a significant roadblock to them taking over my life[BK][BK]I had rope burn around my neck for a few days and I had hit my shoulder when I had fallen so immediately after I had put the rope and stool away, cleaned up what little there was to, I sat down at my table and just kinda stated into space, not really thinking of anything but thinking of everything simultaneously. [BK][BK]It was weird and I will never forget the exhilaration of actually being alive after that. I have felt depression, and thought suicidal thoughts since but that memory, the rope burn, the stool and the weird way the sun had shone on the wall in my kitchen after I had tried came back to me and each time I tried a different way to fight it. [BK]If I have learned one thing since its that you can fight it, but it is hard. I nearly lost but you can fight it. You just have to try.|hang
"Well, I do not know if what I did counts, but I did a 4 day binge on amphetamines. I took 16 30mg vyvanse, snorted 3 adderall 30mg, and took 2 adderall xr 30mg.  My chest started hurting about day 2 and I did not give a shit. So I definitely understood what was the probable end of this. On day 4 about 30 minutes after pill 16 I stood up and my heart hurt extremely bad, my head felt this weird pressure, especially under my teeth, and everything went blank. When I sat back down I looked at my friend and it took me about 10 seconds to realize who he was, where I was, and what I was doing.  I spent the next few hours feeling my blood desperately try to reach my head and feeling like i was passing out every now and again.  I balled my eyes out and I never cry. Everything I valued that I did not realize I did, like the love of my parents, quickly became obvious. I wrote them a death letter telling them how much I should have appreciated them because I was sure my heart was stopping soon, Or that the blood wouldnt stay in my head long enough. After this same feeling continued for two days I just texted my dad, which seemed like the worst case scenario at the time, I just wished that I was dead so that I did not have to face my parents for some reason, 'can you come pick me up, I need you.'""[BK][BK]When they got there I got in the car, balled my eyes out and tried to get it out that I thought my heart was failing.

Maybe like an ego death or something. Tons of abstract insecurities just washed clean.  It was wonderful. Then about a week in bed passed, no doctor could explain why I feel the way I do even after ecgs and ultra sounds, and the old feeling crept back in when I started feeling like I should be doing something buy I could not.

Let me start off with saying this. I am in a much better spot, with a loving fiancée, decent job while going to med school for my dream career. Life could not be better.  Having said that, quite a few years back I cut my throat. I woke up in the hospital with crying parents, wishing I was not there. I was in pain, angry I was still alive, and now having to deal with my parents. What's worse was the therapy that followed in the next few weeks. It did not do a damned thing.  However, much later there was a little moment of clarity. Nothing I was actually angry at, or upset about, was permanent. I could literally just leave, or change. And I did. It was hard, having to cut people out of my life. Some I considered friends, and some were family. But it was worth it. I changed my look, I changed as much as I possibly could. A year later I met the woman I am soon to marry, and im glad I failed.|cut
Well in my particular situation, I was going through what was the roughest patch of my life (so far), I had had enough of it and was going to hang myself in my bedroom. I had the rope all tied off, a chair set up, everything. I got into the chair, put the rope around my throat, pulled it tight.. Then my younger brother walked in.[BK]He started crying his eyes out, pleading for me to get down, yelling at me in confusion, asking why, what was the matter, etc, etc.[BK][BK]It was then I realized, what would the damage be to my siblings, my parents, other family, friends. It would kill them (figuratively), if not send my brother or sister down the same path, and I could not let that happen. [BK]I then changed my life, my thoughts towards things, my actions, everything. I moved away from home and found my 'happy place', and now I could not be happier, then a pig in shit.|hang
I vaguely remember going from being in resuscitation with cables all over me, to being wheeled to an emergency ward and slipping in and out of consciousness after that.

I will give a little into my recent history. My girlfriend and I that have been dating for 4 years, got into a big fight last year. She started giving me less and less respect and more and more attitude until I flipped. I told her that she was treating me like shit and told her that we were done. [BK][BK]Yup, Facebook status to single (sounds cheesy but that is how news is official these days). A few days later I get a call from her.  I was going to block her number permanently but for whatever reason I answered. She was in the hospital from attempting suicide with sleeping pils, pain pills, alchol, anything from her family's medicine cabinet. She wanted me to come see her. [BK][BK]I never planned on seeing her again but my hearts true feelings came out and I got to her as soon as I could. I stayed with her the whole time and never left her side. Move forward about a few months and we are back together and everything is good. [BK][BK]She talks about why she tried to commit suicide. She said I was the most secure and stable thing in her life and without me she did not want to be here (alive) anymore. I find a letter in the mail from her doctor saying that she has a miscarriage due to the suicide attempt. [BK][BK]To this day I have the date written on a picture of her in my wallet. The date is written small across my GF stomach. I look at it and just think where my life would be right now with a wife and kids.[BK][BK]I plan on marrying her and to have a child together. I dream of the day I finally get to meet our baby. |drug
I have struggled with suicide countless times. I truly have lost counts of my thoughts, plans and attempts. I have battled mental health issues and mental illness that has always led me to suicidal conclusions. [BK][BK]I feel like I cannot escape the feelings, like they are a shadow watching my every move and that one day they will win, that my fate is inescapable.[BK][BK]You know what helps me? There is a young man who paces up and down my street, every day, several times a day, in rain or snow or sun or day or night. He is always pacing slowly, smoking a cigarette or drinking a soda or just contemplating. Whether I have a good day or a bad day, he will pace. He is the one constant thing in my otherwise turbulent, unpredictable life. He keeps me grounded on shitty and wonderful days. He will never know how much I appreciate and care for him.

I have got two attempts and one almost attempt to my name. First attempt was trying to swallow pills and just pray I never wake up, I cannot remember what pills they were but I was 17 and stupid so probably nothing that could kill me. Woke up with vomit in my bed and nobody to notice it at home. First thought was 'where the fuck am I?' Since well I thought i was never waking up. [BK][BK][BK]Sending attempt was 2 weeks later. Tried hanging myself in the backyard. Turns out not being a boyscout paid off, the knot at the loop came undone and all I could think was 'I cannot even fucking kill myself properly' [BK][BK]Almost attempt came 3 months later while in counseling and under near 24 hour surveillance from my family or any authority figures cause my parents had seen the cuts on my arms.  [BK][BK] Something minor had set me off, probably something girl related (my girlfriend at the time was also severely depressed, loved her to death, and we helped each other at times but overall we were just straight bad for one another) [BK][BK]So I decided that it was not worth everything, I decided to sneak out and hang myself in the middle of the night (I had a fixation with this way as the summer prior my best friend hung himself, and I was not smart enough for the right pills)  [BK][BK]The thing that changed my mind was remembering that friends mom at his funeral service. I could not bear to think of my mom in the same way, or my friends who were already still living with his death having to go on with mine too. [BK][BK]I think the only reason those thoughts even occurred is because I went to get help (even if it was non optional) so please please please if you are in a dark place get some help. When just taking to the therapist helps. They're not emotionally invested so you can actually have a chance for a rational conversation about what is going on.|cut|hang|drug

I was not stable emotionally and so I went to the liquor store, drank another liter of vodka and downed another bottle full of xanax. [BK][BK]I really wanted to die. I passed out on the street, neighbors drove me to the hospital.

Saw my parents there waiting, felt horrible about it. Sister told me my dad cried (he never cries, he is a tough ass motherfucker).

It was probably berating myself for being selfish, irresponsible and horrible.[BK][BK]I do not consider this an actual suicide attempt because I backed down and did not jerk the wheel but I think it is a little different than most stories maybe so I might as well share. Just to be clear I do not mean to compare this situation to some of the ones in this thread as it is no where near severe. I apologize if anyone feels like it was not a proper attempt so it should not be posted.[BK][BK]I was driving home from class one day during the majority portion of my life in which I was clinically depressed due to a number of factors (though primarily trauma and unfortunate life circumstances). It was night and the road was empty and I was feeling a little bit of a spiral come on. I started to cry and eventually just shut my eyes and pressed my foot down completely on the pedal. My little car started picking up speed and struggling but I heard it rev harder than I had ever before. My hands were shaking and I was desperately trying to build up the strength to jerk the wheel.[BK][BK]I came to my senses after what felt like an eternity but I imagine was not more than a minute because I had not drifted off the road yet, only into the opposite lane from where I started (it was a wide highway). I do not remember how fast I was going at the peak of it because I slammed my brake and started slowing down in a panic before I looked at the speedometer. But I had time to put my brake on and open my eyes to look and in that time it still had not dropped below the high 80s in a car with quite good brakes. [BK][BK]My first thought was how terrible of a person I am and how I really SHOULD just do it if that is how reckless and inconsiderate of others I am, to endanger them like that. My second thought was that I need to tell someone. Unfortunately, I was in the middle of nowhere and was too nervous as an 18 year old girl to pull over in the middle of the night and stop for a long time. So I kept driving even though I was shaking so hard I could not keep the car straight and had to focus really hard to not swerve side to side.[BK][BK]I did not drive for a long time after that, and I still get nervous sometimes when I come home from class at night.|hang|vehicle

I just had a realization that nothing was going to be the same.[BK][BK]My wife was the one that discovered me. She called my mom. I was given a choice between going to a psych hospital voluntarily or by police escort, police escort is an automatic visit to Green Oaks in Dallas...fuck that place. I chose to go voluntarily. Went to a private hospital. It was still the worst week and few days of my entire life. [BK][BK]I was given a diagnosis of BP 1[BK][BK]I did not sleep the entire time...even on Ambien. I had an awful reaction the first night to meds they gave me; not sure if it was the Trazadone or the Abilify. [BK][BK]I was switched to Ambien and Depakote after that. [BK][BK]They took away my anxiety meds. My normally excellent blood pressure of 110/65 shot up to a regular reading of 140/90 for the duration of my stay. They put me on this shitty stuff called Vistaril; it is essentially a giant dose of Benadryl. Did nothing for my anxiety.[BK][BK]I guess I should mention that they took my anxiety meds because I would swallowed a bunch of them and slashed my arms--so I guess that is on me.[BK][BK]Ummm, my roommates (I went through two) snored insanely loud. Part of the reason I did not sleep, though given my anxiety level I doubt I would have slept even in a solo room. Plus I am used to a box fan and you are not getting a box fan in a psych ward.[BK][BK]They also had someone coming through to check on me every few hours...I do not know why....but it was inconvenient to say the least.[BK][BK]I spent the week trolling the nurses station, trying to talk my way out of that place. Told my psych that I was okay. That I did not need to be there. I did not go to most of my classes or meetings or whatever you want to call them. In short I was a pain in the ass. They called my family and told them I was being extremely uncooperative and manipulative. Took a long time after being discharged before I even became med compliant. I am surprised my wife put up with me. [BK][BK]Saw a lot of crazy (no pun intended) shit while I was in there.[BK][BK]Anyway, that is an abbreviated version of my suicide attempt and the repercussions. It's been a long road (6 years) since my diagnosis. I have been in and out of day programs and almost committed multiple times. I have been med resistant and fallen in and out of self harm patterns. I am going through a major bout of rapid cycling as I type this and am due for a meeting with my psych and a med adjustment in a few days.[BK][BK]This mental illness shit is a tough road to plough. Every day is a fight. But I will not give up.[BK][BK]Sorry for the ramble.|cut|bleed|disease|drug
I conciously chose to think nothing. I woke up on my floor surrounded by empty sleeping pill packs, bloody paper towels, and a empty bag of green onion SunChips, mostly spilled, my chosen last meal. Suprisingly, I did not throw up or anything. My friend was banging on my bedroom door. He had no idea, he thought I was just being lazy, and he wanted to go swimming at a local waterfall. I cleared my mind to help hide from the reality of what I would done. I felt like I was watching a black and white movie of the day, like I was actually dead and I was seeing what I missed out on. I was really disappointed when I eventually figured out I was still alive. This is the 3rd time I have even brought it up. I regret not dying. I still think about trying again sometimes. I will try a different brand of pills. Or maybe I will just shoot myself and save the guesswork.|drug
I woke up looking at the finger painting I had made while writing my suicide note, and all I could think about was how hard it was to see and how badly I needed to throw up. I stumbled out of my room to the toilet and hurled all of the pills that I had taken a few hours earlier. My vision was so blurry and I was so bent out of shape, it is a wonder I could move at all, much less down the hall to the bathroom. I felt a hell of a lot better after puking, so I crawled back to my room and passed out. [BK][BK]The next thing I knew, I could hear that god-damned mockingbird who lived in the tree outside my window. Daylight was shining through the French blinds onto my face as I lay in bed. I had an insane migraine headache and my ears were ringing like I had been to the most epic metal concert of my life. I remember feeling so defeated, like the cliché guy who fucks up anything and everything, even his own suicide. At the same time, I felt a bit glad about my lack of success, so I got up and attempted to carry on with my life like normal. Surprise, though, I ended up spending the next week and a half hallucinating, hearing voices, and talking to people in my kitchen who were not even there. I even thought there was some kind of rodent living inside my couch. I could see him and feel him running around underneath the leather, when in fact, there was absolutely nothing there. The after-effect of the overdose was really fucking weird and creepy. Never tried suicide again after that. |drug
I took a paracetamol overdose when I was 17 and drank a little vodka with it (I did not have a lot).[BK][BK]I actually went and did a short shift at a supermarket but ended up leaving early and going to bed.

I confessed to what I would done and said I felt fine so I was expecting to just carry on the day as normal.[BK][BK]IF YOU TAKE AN OVERDOSE AND WAKE UP FEELING 'FINE' - YOU'RE NOT. GO TO THE HOSPITAL.[BK][BK]Paracetamol in particular will take a long time to kill you and it is a painful death as your organs shut down.

About two weeks ago I tried to end myself with rubbing alcohol, and needless to say it was not at all fun. [BK][BK]Pretty much seconds after I started chugging it out of the bottle my throat swelled up and I couldnt breathe at all for a good few seconds, and at that moment I realized I seriously fucked up. [BK][BK]All of this happened outside my house really late at night, and the alcohol part of it kicked in nigh instantly because it was only ten minutes later that I was wandering my small town without enough clothes on for the weather hoping I would freeze to death or pass out and not wake up, but it never ended up happening, and because of my regret I managed to get on the phone with a friend, and I ended up throwing the bottle of rubbing alcohol as far from myself as possible and going back home. [BK][BK]I ended up not even waking my parents while sneaking back into the house, and even got a nights rest, but I was still suffering in the morning, and I would ended up getting a friend to cally parents because I could not face them myself in the state I was in, they got me to a hospital and I was watched over and then released the same day, because I would only managed to get down maybe 100ml of the 500ml bottle, and ended up metabolizing it. [BK][BK]The following days were mostly spent nursing a hangover filled with regret and some self beating on for what I would done, but I came out of it realizing it was an impulse act fuelled by my mild depression and suicidal thoughts, as I would found the rubbing alcohol not even three hours before I attempted suicide with it. [BK][BK]Currently I am still sort of nursing myself back to mental health and I am signed up for an intensive outpatient program, which is essentially a daily group therapy on week days, and so far I have already rebounded back to what I would call decently stable (still probably mildly depressed though) |alcohol
When I tried to hang myself junior year of HS I thought that would be the solution to all my issues. That all the pain and shit I have felt and thought about would be gone. The memories of my parents fighting and me hiding, the times I was bullied, the times I just felt terrible about myself. I thought they would all be gone. Then when I tried to do it it is weird I just could not bring myself to do it, and thinking back on it 8 years later, I really cannot come up with a reason why. [BK][BK]I do not remember my first conscious thought.[BK][BK]I sorta blacked the memory out, but a feeling is still there. The feeling that I do not want any other person to feel that way about themselves. That life is that hopeless. So, while it was a battle and still is a battle this very day, I focused my life on a career of entertainment, specifically comedy, because I want to tell stories that make people laugh and also understand mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. I guess what drove me not to do it ultimately is the idea that if I can make people laugh and smile for one moment it is worth going through all shitty parts of my life.|hang|disease

"'Fuck, I cannot move my legs'""  [BK]  [BK]I woke up after taking a handful of Tylenol and Klonopin.

I am a bigger guy, so I guess I did not take enough because I woke up I do not know how much longer later and I recognized it did not work, then when I tried to get up, I could not move my legs... I tried to massage them to get blood flowing but I was sitting for about an hour without even feeling them. I had to text me roommate, who was also my best friend since grade school, that I needed his help. I did not tell him what happened, but he wanted me to go to the on-campus health center. I told him I was fine, and he still half-carried me there.  [BK]  [BK]Ended up going to therapy a few weeks later. It helped. He still does not know what I tried to do.

I was honestly mad. Mad that I was in the hospital with tubes down my throat, mad at the nurses for how they were speaking to me and treating me, mad that my mom was there crying and questioning me, mad that I had survived.  [BK]It took some time to get over the anger, but once that subsided I figured that I now had a second chance so I would attempt to make what things I could control better in my life.   [BK]It was not easy, and although I have a beautiful family, a stable job, finances under control, and do not abuse drugs I still get a random bought of depression. I had to realize that there is situational depression and non-situational, how to differentiate between the two and how to help it. When I attempted suicide I had lost my grandfather, my step dad was abusive, my boyfriend molested me and raped me once, and I was dealing with teenage hormones on top of it all. Instead of focusing on the grief of loosing a loved one I tried to self medicate with drugs (both prescribed by my therapist and street). That of course did not help and I intentionally overdosed. Feeling depressed during times of trauma is okay. It's normal. It's healthy. It should not be numbed..it needs to be felt in all its entirety. [BK]  [BK]Now when there is no outside reason to be depressed and you suddenly get sad for no reason, then you must focus on any and all the positives in your life. Retrain your mind to not dwell on things out of your control or things in the past that can no longer be resolved. Learn how to redirect your thoughts into something productive. I turned to my creative side and wrote, drew, sang, danced, anything to release the energy and feel better about myself. I still battle with it. Life is not easy, but then again life would be boring if it were so I take it day to day.|drug
My Mom killed herself with an overdose of drugs. 2 shots of heroine, 4 Xanax, 4 OxyContins. That's how I found her laying on the floor at 9am in her little apartment. She had cancer and was a heroine addict for 30yrs. I have thought of ending my life before, but the thought of leaving that as my mark on earth and hurting people I know, it is not worth it!

I luckily failed 7 years ago. Disappointment and more sadness. Then sensational euphoria. Almost like an explosion of sensory information. Came to in an ambulance. I was unconscious  hanging with a rope around my neck for 7 minutes, my mom walked in early from work and found me. She called 911, got recesitated 3 minutes later since an ambulance was down the street for an epileptic man. Disappointment was the biggest feeling and then what I can describe as an adrenaline rush almost. Like the blood just came back to my brain in a wave. I am still fighting depression to this day even with drugs and therapy. I cannot say I am happy, more so that I do not want to leave my family destroyed and sad now, something I understand better now. If I did not have family or friends, I would be gone. If anythings worth suffering for, it is so my family and friends  stay strong. I am glad other people who survived do not feel like I do, it is just not my reality. Good luck to you other survivors, I wish you a better life. |bleed|hang|drug
"'Fuck, are my parents here?'""

I was parked in a lot near this beatiful park I would grown up next to at like 3 AM.

I was real scared. I did not want to go on living, I really did not. The depression makes me feel that way, like I am worth  nothing, and at times I will believe it. I get urges all the time to jump out a car or keep on drinking until I meet my maker, but when I woke up I was scared that I had gone through with it. I cried and cried and held a knife, just shaking and trying to work up the courage to slit my throat like a beautiful smile. But I thought to myself there was no way in hell I will let myself lose to the thoughts, so I called a friend and got help.[BK][BK]What people do not realize often about depression is that it works differently in different people. It scares the shit out if me. My depression does not make me sad, it makes me angry for no reason, and I mean anger like I caught someone fucking my own mother after drugging her after a turn with my sister's. The urges make me want to slam people into the counter at work for asking me what size coffee we have, or kicking a puppy for licking me too much. I fight my depression by making myself sad, listening to music I know will trigger me and thinking about the day I found out my son's mother cut her own throat the way I was about to my own (two years later I found out, it broke me). Point of my ramble is that I am glad I got help, I am glad I have the strength to not stab my co-workers and to not hurt that puppy, I am glad I have people that care about me, even if the devil on my shoulder tries his hardest to convince me no one cares. [BK][BK]My advice to anyone going through what I do every damn day is to keep on going as best you can. I know it is hard, im in tears writing this out. I know sometimes you wake up and you cannot move because what is the point of getting up again, who gives a shit if you live or die, right? Well I am saying people do care, but you have to care yourself. Find your courage in what you can, armor yourself with whatever pleasant thoughts you can, and reach out. Someone, somewhere will grab your hand and pull you to the safety of what you need, be it pills or hospitalization or just a friendly soul to vent to. Fight on, my friends. Fight your devil's with kindness so that one day, someone will save you from yourself. [BK][BK]Damn, that felt good to get out.

"Never shared to anyone, but partially anonymously on Reddit is actually quite fine for some reason. That or it is because it is 5am.[BK][BK]Born in 92, growing up was really bad. I was like, 4 or 5 or something and both parents would beat me daily. Separately too. Half of it was me doing something. Other half is legit still a mystery to me. Dad left when I was 9, so it made it just mom to keep beating my ass til i was like 12-14, i dont even remember when it stopped. Slippers, belts, sometimes the buckle of the belt. Kneeling on salt, arms sideways up. Proper lashing. Facing the altar, forced to ask the Lord for forgiveness. I do not know if that is where I get my faith or I just have it in me. All that time as a kid, planning to end it, but selfishly finding ways for it not to hurt. Tried slitting the wrists. Ended up a coward that could not go beyond outer skin level. Brother was a big torture. Everything he did, I get blamed. Had severe anxiety and fear throughout the whole thing and even had some moments after my mother calmed down (after 12-14). She started to calm down when she took a strike with the belt buckle and I just grabbed the buckle mid air and stared at her.  Happy I did not end it because when I was 14-15, I met my group. My squad. The Men. These guys got me over whatever the fuck was bothering me at home and just got me out of there without even intending to. We just go to internet cafes and played games after school every single day. Affected my grades, did not give 2 shits, I would get beath either way, but I did not because I did not realise that is when my mother calmed herself. Graduated high school with these guys with the last year the best year of my life. Met the love of my life because of them. She was their childhood friend, a batchmate of ours in school, different section because we were in this school that had sections segregating boys and girls. Somehow convinced her I was boyfriend material after high scool, around 2010 and still together to this day. I did not think I would get emotional typing this. I thought this was behind me. I ended up moving to London around 2013, long distance relationship with the girlfriend. Brother and other families in Switzerland, mother still in The Philippines, where I was, now that I mention it, I never said that yet. My aunt from Switzerland gives me support when I need it, I work McD and it is depressing lately too. Hoping to attend college here this year since it will be my 3rd year after residing in the United Kingdom, so I dont have to pay no 'overseas fee'"" and I can get support from my brother and/or my aunt. It''s still a little overwhelming at times that I am alone here in London, but not as bad as the first few months. Currently love my mother and my brother, despite all of that happened to me. I was mostly a coward in my suicide attempts, but almost happened and that scares me today. I still appreciate what my friends did for me despite them barely knowing a thing about my situation at the time. I still chat with them, have voice calls on the internet while we play separate games or occasionally play together. Somehow getting this off my chest was good. Kinda hurts for some reason. But it does give me will to move forward. I did a lot of things and been through a lot as well. I guess this is as much as I can share.

I woke up with abdominal pain each time, but it faded. [BK][BK]After the first two times, I considered other methods. The benefit of wrist slashing was that I found out, for me, self-harm is a protective mechanism - it shocks me out of the fugue state I get into when I am suicidal. That helped me survive a good few years.[BK][BK]I was genuinely trying to die, but my core reasoning - that it was to protect the people I loved who would be sad for a while but overall the balance would mean their lives would be infinitely better without me - meant that consideration of who would find me and how traumatic that would be was a primary concern. [BK][BK]I am convinced that this accounts for a major part of the discrepancy between men and women''s suicidal behaviour - women try more, men complete more. Women are socialised to be continually aware of the people around us and how our existence affects them. The much more certainly lethal methods are also the most traumatic for others.

I may have been wrong there--though I stayed off of Levothyroxine for a while, I had to take a beta blocker for several weeks to deal with the side effects of the levothyroxine overdose. Beta blockers are the worst. [BK][BK]In retrospect, I cannot help thinking that I probably made my thyroid cancer worse with that overdose (I have had 2 surgeries since then). That''s probably the thought that sticks with me most about the ordeal, besides feeling harassed by my roommate at the psychiatric ward and the intense feeling of boredom while I was there. """|drug

I woke up in the hospital feeling something like a hangover. It was basically because my body was overtired since I had fought like an animal when they were forcing the coals down my throat. For those that do not know what that is it is standard procedure to put coals into the patients system if he is admitted to the ICU because of attemted suicide through pain medication, so he will vomit up anything inside his stomach. Apparently the coals also work like a sponge while they are inside you, sucking up whatever it is you ingested. But to get them inside you they have to force a tube down your neck and into your stomach. I do not remember much of what happened in while this was happening. But I had vague memories of me screaming my lungs out like I had experienced a nightmare. I also had rashes all over my body that formed because I over exerted myself while wrestling with the doctors. But the first thing that came to my mind when I regained full consciousness was shame. I was deeply ashamed of myself for having done something so stupid. The way my family looked at me was something I wont forget. I was 18 at the time and had never really dealt with my depression or told anyone about it so it came as a huge surprise to them. I felt alienated from them because of my actions. [BK][BK]I had to see a psychiatrist after the incident (understandably). That really helped me get a better perspective on how I had hurt my family and that what I had done was a deeply selfish act. I am not trying to shame people that try suicide or tell anyone that he is a bad person for thinking about it. But if you go through with what you are thinking about you are saying goodbye to everyone that loves you permanently. You are taking a fully self centered decision to end your life and to me it is probably the most selfish thing you can do. |drug

"Please do not read this if you are diabetic and depressed. Hell, do not read this if you are a medical dependent with depression. It''s dark as hell. If you need someone to talk to, PM me or check the sticky''d mod post at the top.[BK][BK]Let me tell you about how my world used to work. Mind the rant, you cannot really turn this sort of thing into storytelling.[BK][BK]A type 1 diabetic in shit control is basically in a constant living state of a suicide attempt. You are constantly fighting to keep yourself alive while your body does everything possible to throw you into either a coma (extreme low BG levels) or into Diabetic ketoacidosys (extreme high BG levels).[BK][BK]If you take that struggle and add depression (which is statistically common in childhood onset type 1), you get a situation that can cause that living constant attempt. In fact, it is downright masochistic just how that edge is. [BK][BK]The weirdest part is that that sort of dangerous edge could be unintentional. Just not having good control can put you in that perilous medically neglectful spiral.[BK][BK]Another issue is that lack of medication can directly cause depression and a host of other 'lethargic'"" style symptoms. Once your in the hole, it is horribly hard to climb out. Even the effort to go and get your Meds from a cabinet could be enough to wind you and force you to need a rest.[BK][BK]Even stranger, the well accepted remedy is to have a specialized doc (endocrinologist) basically yell at you. They cannot actually help you if you cannot keep up the treatments. That means that the chronic illness that allows that situation can only be improved by reducing the depression. It''s a catch-22.[BK][BK][BK]I am in better shape now but there are still moments that I have to work incredibly hard to keep my self stable. It''s a challenge but it allows me to appreciate every moment to it is fullest and it gives me a hell of a sense of humor. [BK]"""|disease|drug

Well, this was not so much a intended suicide per-say, rather a bad event that I was going with. I was caught out in a rip-tide one day along with my sister, and as we were young, we could not swim very well. About that time, I was receiving the brunt of bullying in my school life. So I was thinking, 'At least people will not have to deal with this annoying, awkward kid.' So I kinda just stopped swimming, and began sinking.[BK][BK]About 30 or so seconds underwater (like I said, I was not actually intending to die rather than go along with it, so I was not really in a rush to drown), I started getting pulled by some random bloke who happened to see me and my sister (she was being helped by my dad, who had a really bad back from an incident in the army). I still was not really doing anything, rather then going along with it, so I literally was not moving anything, just being pulled. We eventually made it to shore, and taken to hospital.[BK][BK]I dunno if I was in shock or whatever, really still had not been feeling anything, so when we got back to where we were staying at the time, I kinda just sat around on the couch. My sister was a bit more upset about it. She cried about how she felt terrible about how she put me in danger, because the reason we were out there was because our younger brother and ourselves were playing a game. When she admitted that, that was the first thing I actually thought since. Knowing that my sister (who up until then I respected immensely but did not think cared for me, like everybody else) was worried for me rather then herself during the time...kinda just struck.[BK][BK]So now, I am out of school, entering university, and gotten over the bullies. Most of 'em were dickheads, and the majority of them actually had some issues of their own (some physical, some mental).

My first thought was the same as another user's comment. Why did they have to bring my parents into this? Couldn't I have just had my time alone in the mental hospital until discharge and then face them? It seemed like they were like hey lets force this kid who attempted suicide to do the next shameful thing....talk to your parents a about it when it could have been they were all or part of the reason.  I am Asian so I felt at the time it was more shameful and embarrassing for me for them to have to see a son who attempted to kill himself. Being forced to talk to them at the mental hospital after was so gut wrenching. [BK][BK]So this is my first post ever on Reddit because suicide is a very important topic to me. I have been on Reddit for maybe 9 months and sometimes I will think about creating an account and posting but never get around to it but I wanted to elaborate for those who are interested. [BK][BK]So the first time I took 40 Benadryls and woke up deaf in one ear for the day. I did not tell anyone until way later on after the attempt that actually put me in the hospital. I was pretty freaked out but eventually my hearing came back. I do recall being very drowsy and trying to go to the restroom but I kept trying to open the door like the handle was at the bottom of the door. It was strange because I obviously knew where the door handle was but was so disoriented I was either hallucinating or just too messed up to get my body to rise fully. [BK][BK]Fast forward a few months or so later I took 90. I actually bought the 100 pill bottle but was taking 10 at a time in 5 minute intervals and only made it to 90. They said I puked up purple and started to seize. Apparently they forced coal down into my stomach to get me to regurgitate as much of the drugs as possible before it entered my system. Mind you this is a recount from my parents so I am not positive on all of the details. He told me the doctor said I flatlined and a defibrillator was used to bring my pulse back. Those who visited me said I was conscious for 3 days in the hospital but not mentally so. They said I kept crossing my eyes and seemed to just not be there. I do not actually remember any of it. My first conscious memory is walking with an IV into the mental hospital where I stayed for 10 days before being discharged. Luckily my parents did not approve the anti depressants because I did not want to take them either especially considering I was 16. I had heard that they cause more issues with mental stability prior to 18 but that was about 8-9 years ago. [BK][BK]|drug
Well my suicide attempt was a mixture of tablets at 3am in the morning 2 years ago. I took a mix of psychiatric medication as I had not long been discharged from the psych ward and every other tablet I could find in the girlfriends house. This included prescription strength painkillers, asprin and many more. I think in total the police counted 400+ tablets had been opened from previously closed boxes.[BK][BK]I do not remember even getting to the hospital, or even the emergency services being called but I was in intensive care for 7 days and i had to be resuscitated twice. Eventually when I came too, apparently I said to the doctors, why did you not let me go peacefully. [BK][BK]Nevertheless, I was filled with guilt as my parents come in to see me, tubes everywhere machines bleeping, heart monitor all over the place. [BK][BK]Several hours later I was taken to a ward for a week long review. Kidneys and liver were heavily hit during the OD but thanks to doctors I guess I am OK now. No permanent damage, except for some flashbacks. [BK][BK]Part of me wishes I was still successful and I do not regret what I did but I am now moving on in life with a lot of mental health support.

I had a rough breakup. Was sitting in my bathtub sobbing with a loaded .45 1911 in my mouth. Pulled the trigger but for some reason it did not fire, I ended up dropping the gun, texting my mom to come pick me up and to check me into a hospital. Ended up spending 5 days in the psych ward, crying at night as all the thoughts haunted me, how I would never hear my dad's laugh again, or feel the unconditional love that my mom exudes. Or holding my cat at night when I am having a terrible day. I am glad that the gun malfunctioned, and I am glad to still be here today even though I still have days where I wish things were different, and I am slowly changing them for the better. [BK][BK]The worst thing through out the experience was the countless times how I had to tell different doctors how I planned to kill myself. At the time I had 5 different ways, all of which involved not being found by my mother; parents are divorced so no chance my dad would find me as he lives in another state; and all the while seeing the hurt on my mom's face, that look of her baby hurting as bad as he was... that was utter gut wrenching and I feel horrible for putting her through all of that but I am glad she was there for me. The other hard part was when my dad would call me at the psych ward before the visitor hours were over just to talk to me for a little bit, I broke down in tears every single time just because I would hear his voice and feel safe, that maybe everything will ultimately work out in the long run.[BK][BK]That was 7 months ago today it still hurts to think about, but I rather people know that they are not alone, nothing is worth ending your life for, no matter how shitty of a situation you are in, it is not the end of the world, someone loves you out there unconditionally.|cut|gun

Permanently some motor function in one of my hands because of it as well as various other weird nerve damage because of the pills and amount I took.[BK][BK]I had to be resuscitated both times, multiple times. I really really wanted to die. I do not so much anymore, especially after finally being giving the right pills at the right dosage for psychotic depression.[BK][BK]If you are on the edge and considering and happen to be reading this as that internal cry for help, or self-flaggelation. Well. I cannot help you. I know when I was in your place nothing anyone said made sense, fit me, or sounded real/genuine. I remember when I woke up in the first hospital, after a couple days I met a nurse that said '""so... you tried to kill yourself?'"" and I was like '""um.. yeah'"". She replied with, and in the most bland, boring, apathetic I-could-care-less attitude '""But you have so much to live for'"". I am pretty sure I broke up laughing. Just thinking about it now even seem fucking insane that she would say that to me, and like that. [BK][BK]Anyway, if you are that very rare person who somehow is going through the exact thing I was going through- 1. its much worse to be suicidal and too afraid to do it because of what you experienced last time (literal, true hell, the hallucinations gave me a panic disorder and sparked off serious psychotic symptoms in my day-to-day life). Essentially truly feeling like '""you have no options'"". and 2. God, the world, whatever you believe in that you think is ''judging'' you so harshly and wants you for dead. Think about how many people in the world there are, how many of them do not know about you and do not care about you, and then ask yourself why god or the great gaia spirit would be any different. Ask yourself why they would care about you begging for forgiveness. They do not. You''ve been asking forgiveness of yourself this whole time.

The first thing I remember is waking up to my friends banging on my door and barging into my flat. I would been unconscious for 3 days, because I had snorted a strong sleeping drug. The last thing I remember before passing out was a feeling of utter peace and happiness, since I felt like I was finally fading away and leaving all my problems behind.[BK]My friends got me to the hospital where I was incoherent. I was hooked up to an IV, which I managed to rip out, and I remember asking the nurse for a paper and pen so I could write a strongly worded letter to David Cameron about the state of the mental health services.

My dad had been in everyday and I know it killed him to see me that way.[BK]All in all, I was in hospital for a week, and when I got home I just felt even worse than I had done. [BK][BK]Since then, I have still struggled a lot with severe anxiety and depression, but I have promised myself to stop all the self harm and suicide attempts. I have relapsed a couple of times, but I am getting there. I realised I was fed up with being a prisoner to my own mind, and if over 7 years the NHS were only going to prescribe me useless pills, I would take matters into my own hands. I bought myself a book on mindfulness, and it is really helping. I am optimistic I will be 'fixed' by the end of the year, and my only regret is waiting so long to do so. [BK][BK]My advice to anyone in a similar position: If you are feeling hopeless, worthless, and like life is pointless, the best thing to do is to talk to someone close to you. You can only bottle up your feelings for so long before they overwhelm you. Don't be proud. Talking about how you feel is not a sign of weakness. Things can get better. X|cut|drug
Bit late to the thread, but I will post it anyway. Good to get it off my chest.[BK][BK]I tried to hang myself in 8th grade. I was bullied a lot in middle school, could not trust my friends, picked on by teachers and students alike. At home my parents were always on my case about very small things, but that stacked with the school shit took its toll. One night after a particularly bad day, I decided to end it. Nothing could be worse than the life I was living. [BK][BK]I took a wire coat hanger and twisted it around my neck, twisted it around a clothing bar in my closet, and dropped my legs out. Immediately I was overwhelmed with fear and regret, and thought about my family, my brothers, everyone who I cared about. I felt selfish and stupid and scared, but my legs stopped working and I could not stand up. Slowly my vision started to fade, and I thought I was about to die.[BK][BK]I woke up afterwards on the ground, because the hanger had snapped at some point. As soon as I realized I was alive, I just started bawling. I was so happy that I had failed, so happy that I had not died. I just laid there on the ground for a long time, so happy that I was alive.[BK][BK]So, to answer your question, my first thought was one of relief.|hang
"'God damn it, maybe if I do not answer, they will go away'"" I did not even get a chance to fall asleep, I would told my best friend I cut myself really deep and I guess that was enough for her to call an ambulance.

They eventually found me and took me to the ambulance.[BK][BK]At the hospital I felt like I failed, sure, but maybe now I would get the help I needed. It took a while for any family member to show up, and it was my uncle and cousin, they said my grandma (who raised me) fell leaving the other hospital my grandpa was in when she heard about me and tried to run, she broke her cheek bone and had to get stitches. They did not say much, did not seem very concerned and eventually left to go check on my grandma.[BK][BK]Eventually my grandma showed me, by now I had drank my 4 bottles of charcoal and puked several times. She of course was upset but only made me feel worse by saying she cracked her face trying to get to me, I still blame myself. She left within half an hour, had to go check on grandpa because he did not know what was going on, so I was alone again.[BK][BK]And I was alone for several hours, waiting to be transferred to the hospital with the psych ward. Being alone and still feeling like the least priority did not make me feel better. What did was the nurse who kept checking on me.

Despite the dark sides you gotta look to the happy sides, to the people who care, even when they do not seem to, or when they are angry with you, or when they ignore you.[BK]Because as much as you want to disappear to make sure they are happy, because you feel you drag them down, in the end you hurt them more when you go.[BK][BK]Thank you '""M.G'"" for teaching me that."""|hang
I have not personally tried to commit suicide, but my best friend did. She tried to take a bunch of pills to overdose. I remember trying to take care of her after and get her to the hospital, but she refused to go. I remember her being absolutely out of it, confused, she said she was numb, and she had a lot of blurry vision. The next day she tried to go to work and was not much better, and her coworker finally made her to go the hospital. She ended up getting 5150'd and they released her the next day, did not pump her stomach either. [BK][BK]I do remember her being very upset, angry, and depressed that she did not die and she ended up being 5150'd. But a few weeks later she found out she was pregnant. Thankfully, after having her first daughter she is been doing a lot better. She also had a son about a year later. She is been getting help for her anxiety and depression and I have seen a huge change in her. [BK][BK]I can tell you that it was one of the worst experienced of my life, it was heart breaking. I felt not good enough to help her, I felt helpless. I know there was nothing you could do, but when my best friend, who is like my sister, tried to die on purpose... It was just horrible. [BK][BK]It has now been about 4 years since the incident, and we lost a friend due to liver disease. After that she came to me an apologized for ever putting me through that grief and she would never do it again. I, of course, appreciated the gesture but told her she did not have to apologize. I understood she was in pain. But I am so happy she still walks the earth and is better. |disease|drug
I think my post got deleted I am not sure but I will re post it[BK]So I have been depressed for a few years now and I lost grasp of late 2015 earlier this year. I had been getting bullied for years and I did not really care or think of it much till recently and it got to me so much that I could not take it. If you saw what I had posted earlier I said I had drank to try and kill my self but it did not work, so I did the same thing but tried lean and other drugs with it. As it had hit me before I was even dead I felt dead, but I finally had passed out. I woke up the next day maybe at 7-8 in the evening, my parents and brother had been gone the whole weekend and I woke up and just started vomiting everywhere. After that I still felt off, and sick almost but nothing of the night before and it scared the shit out of me. It made me realize that I could get through it and I just need to tough it out. [BK][BK]I am glad I am here today.|drug|alcohol
"i do not even remember, I just felt awful for the next 3 days.[BK][BK]i had several 'attempts'"" before that but I honestly just think it was a cry for attention. i intentionally did not take a lethal dose.[BK][BK]but this time was different. each time I have an episode I get less and less scared, more and more impulsive. [BK][BK]it was a few days after Christmas. my sleep schedule was really fucked up, i did absolutely nothing all day, and I had been mentally screwing with a guy twice my age because I was so unhappy with myself. my mom (I am a teenager btw) came in at like 8 AM and I was still awake. she started yelling at me for doing nothing and sleeping all day. I was really apathetic and just kept saying '""ok.'"" I was too tired to care. She slammed my door and I fell asleep.[BK][BK]I woke up at like 5pm. I do not really know what was going through my head. Probably barely anything. I went downstairs and locked myself in the bathroom and got the Arsenal of pills out because I found where my mom hid them. She was in the room right next to me. [BK][BK]I just kind of lined them up. It was almost like I was playing with them at that point. Then I started slowly taking them. I had been in there for a while. My mom heard the sound of pills being '""shaken'"" so she came to the door and told me she knew what I was doing. She was not all that panicked. She got a screwdriver and started unscrewing the door handle,obviously taking her time. So I just said fuck the rest of the pills I lined up, emptied a bottle of sleeping pills into my hand and took them all at once.[BK][BK]i am really tiny. 108 lbs and not even 5 feet. So it really fucked me up. My mom finally got the door open, said '""really?'"" and I just walked past her. It hit me almost immediately. As I was walking up the stairs I started feeling really heavy...really out of it. I just sort of fell onto my bed and was staring at the ceiling.[BK][BK]my mom came in my room and started saying the stuff she usually does. I do not even remember what she said, everything about my life and me was blurry as I was laying there. I felt my heart slowing, it was getting really hard to breathe. I was struggling to keep myself awake...and then I thought '""oh fuck, am I dying?'""[BK][BK]Then I felt completely disassociated. The REAL me could not speak. It was kind of like...my subconscious was speaking? I just remember crying for my mom. Just saying '""mom, mom'"" as she stood in the doorway and said nothing. I could not even turn my head to look at her. I passed out.[BK][BK]I woke up a little bit later and started choking on my own vomit. I ran to the bathroom and continued throwing up. I was really disoriented, and still found myself calling for my mom. My little brother saw (3) and got my mom to come upstairs. She just stood there and watched me gag/vomit. Then, in the most apathetic tone, said[BK][BK]'""You better just go to the kitchen and drink some milk'"" before walking away.[BK][BK]I do not really think I thought anything when I woke up. I did not feel anything either. I was just kind of like, '""ok.'"""""|drug|alcohol
Hello! I am glad you started this thread, hopefully experiences can be read to help save other people.[BK][BK]I tried to kill myself Janurary of last year by ingesting a mix of amphetamines, prescription sleeping medicine, and acetaminophen. I was in my bathroom waiting to die, when I realized what I was doing was not going to solve my problems. The things I went through were purely material, and had no impact on my future. I knew my decision was a mistake as soon as I swallowed everything.[BK][BK]I immediately called my mother, told her my situation, and she hauled ass to my home while I made myself throw up. All I could do was apologize to her, but she said I had nothing to apologize for. She was just glad I was still with her.[BK][BK]I checked into a hospital, took up yoga, and left with a new outlook. It gets hard sometimes, but I remember where I couldve been, and I feel greatful.|drug
Weirdly enough, I felt relief. I was feeling shitty at the time, and honestly felt like some force just hated me and wanted me to die, one of the typical symptoms of depression.

I was 15 when I was diagnosed with depression and I attempted Suicide at 16 (and then again at 17)[BK][BK]I attempted to hang myself with some rope that I bought from the local hardware store. I had enough of pretty much everything at that time, school grades were low, friends turned into bullies and my family were abusive and just down right horrible to me ever since my grandfather past away (when I was 3)[BK][BK]It was a thursday night and when my grandmother was not near my room that is when I tied a noose from the various videos and instruction things I read online and I got a chair from the kitchen which was a few feet away and i remember hanging for about 5 sec. I felt the pressure on my neck and felt extremely hot as i kicked the chair from under me. the rope eventually broke and I fell to the ground. I remember just coughing a lot and my grandmother came in to ask what that noise was and she saw it all and I pretty much had to persuade for to take me to the hospital. I had rope burn and I was there for 1 month. I could not have coat hangers, shoe laces, string anything that I could hang myself with, no mobile phones, no computer besides the one in the mental institute part which was for 'learning only' Family would call up those in there with me. There was about 18 rooms I was in the 8th room and it was a mix of boys and girls under 20. I was the youngest there twice when I have been. I spent my month there just being away from everyone, drawing,writing and talking to doctors about things. [BK]My family or friends never called me, I spent my whole month there just alone, my second time 1 year later I spent 3 weeks there because I begged them to take me out, I did not like being in that part of the hospital.

Throwaway account here...[BK][BK]I was in college living with my best friend, her boyfriend, and another guy they knew. I followed her to that school in hopes she would finally come to her senses and be with me. We got really serious. To the point we started  imagining our wedding. Things fell apart and it was just sleepless night after night. She took interest in the other guy and one night we were all kinds drinking, they went upstairs and she implied she was going up to bang him just to piss me off. I just felt heartbroken. Everything I have up. I had no future, I failed college, lost my childhood home, insane debt, no job. I looked at the smirnoff ice and decided to chug as many as I could so I would not wake up. It was strange I did not view it as suicide. I was young and stupid and obviously did not know anything about Smirnoff since I only works up with a bad headache and heartache.

"First though: 'I do not want it to end like this.'""[BK]A little bit late and not too sure if this really counts, but here''s my story:[BK]I was depressed as a teenager but was too afraid of the possible nothing after death, so i was always too afraid to try. I hated myself for not being able to just do it and get it over with. Instead i got into as many drugs as a child could with no money, which is a surprising amount. I was with my SO at the time and did a few too many and overdosed, so instead of a high to make me senseless i tripped so bad i though that i died. Seconds felt like an eternity and everything that my senses perceived would repeat hundreds of times until they picked up something else to torture me with. After i came out of the experience, the SO was holding me and crying. She told me that i was flipping between shallow rapid breaths to not breathing. I was like that for almost an hour. After i threw up a few times, i laid dow and cried until my eyes were dry. After that day, i had PTSD? (Would have the same feeling) I hated every day after and sometimes felt like i did die on that day. Thankfully for me it moved me away from the terrible people that i used to call my friends and kept me away from drugs. I am better now, but still have anxiety when i feel get Deja Vu.

I have had partial memory loss after a suicide attempt. I overdosed on my prescribed anti depressants and was in the hospital for three weeks. I remember nothing of those three weeks nor do I remember what made me decide to take my own life. I remember going to sleep that night crying and drifting into the darkness but that is it. I was conscious (but not all there according to family members) about 2 days later after being moved from CCU to ICU after being in a medically induced coma. My heart stopped a couple times the night of. When I became fully cognitive three weeks later I was a different person. I was no longer depressed and 6 months later was weened off my medications completely. This happened about 4 years ago and I still have no memories of that time period. I only know what I have been told from family members. I feel that there is a lot missing from my childhood memories as I can only call back upon two or three memories. I think my depression began when my father passed away and he was not very present in my life but I still can only recall one memory of him. the hardest part about repressed memories is not knowing what you have forgotten. I hope that one day I will remember again but I am also scared that if I remember again I may become depressed again. what if I forgot all of that stuff for a reason and that is the reason I am not depressed anymore?

My ex fiance tried. We were together for a few months at the beginning but he was still missing his ex at the time. He called me one night, saying he had a knife and he will kill himself if I did not call call his ex. Instead I called the police. They found him in the bush, bleeding and they took him to hospital. He was in the mental ward overnight, but he talked his way out. He admitted later on to me that he was not ready to leave. Months later, he said that he had burned himself and had his arm wrapped up in bandages. I saw his arms later. They were not burns. His arms have so many scars, they are like tattoo sleeves. But when you love someone, you learn to look past the scars. You learn to see them for who they really are, and people look at him all the time like he is crazy because of his arms. But he is brave and pretends not to notice the judgemental stares. He tried again and he said to me that the pain after cutting his wrists was the worst pain he is ever felt. It was so bad he never wanted to try it again, at least not that way. We are not together any more but people like him need a guardian angel to look over them and to take away their pain, mental or physical. For the people who feel such a deep level of sorrow and pain seem to also love and feel the universe in an equally profound way. We need more people like that to stay in this world. I hope he forever does. |cut|bleed
My family. [BK][BK]Through the most intense suicidal thoughts this comes to my mind. I hate the fact of this barrier. How they are gonna feel and cope. I cannot stand continually living everyday handicapped. I am on the autism spectrum, have bipolar disorder, and ADD. I have to be drugged just to stay 'sane'? I dropped out of university cause my intellect is not enough to be there, let alone the lower vocational trades jobs. I cannot even do anything! Even the basics of driving a car. Most of the time thinking, I wish I was not born, I wish my mum did not meet my dad because he has aspergers and because of that, I am witnessing their five sons, my brothers, literally fighting, arguing, smashing things between each other virtually everyday. My dad's the most threatening at this. I cannot stand it, I hate autism.[BK][BK]I feel alone. Who's gonna be at my funeral if I die? I am sad at how I cannot maintain friends.   Stuff people take for granted. I do not look like I have autism, so I can make friends but cannot maintain them, I get liked and approached but am not socially intuitive. I have lost a lot of friends. I am upset of how the world is promoting acceptance of autism rather than seeing it as a disorder and the need to prevent and fix it. [BK][BK]I still get feelings of death. I have tried everything from psychology, and yes psychiatry. 7 years of everything - if you have name it, I have tried it. It's a cause that is unknown. I hate autism. I am tired of staying 'sane'. |disease|drug
"TL;dr - tried OD''ing, did not die, thankful for life and vowed to never commit again[BK][BK][BK]I tried to silently commit suicide without anybody knowing through overdosing on over-the-counter medication.

I woke up to see a nurse standing by me. The first time I tried to commit suicide I was 14,and was found in a park. My first thought / feeling...  Embarrassed. Which quickly turned to anger, and sadness, as the nurse told me my family was notified but refused to come see me because I was just looking for attention. I had failed tests, failed relationships, but nothing felt as crushing as knowing you failed at dying. I live in a small town, so I also knew everyone else would know. And somehow it made me feel like the biggest piece of shit. I would describe it as crushing, overwhelming pressure. [BK][BK]My second time I was 17, I had drank a ton of booze, and then proceeded to swallow every pill, medication I could find in the bathroom. My neighbour found me on the floor as my parents and brother were away in Germany. When coherent enough to understand what was going on I sort of felt like, this is the second time, maybe I am not supposed to die. Because people keep intervening. So I asked the nurse if I could stay for a bit, get myself some help. Still felt embarrassed, still felt like a bag of shit. [BK][BK]I am 27, actually tomorrow's my birthday, so 28. No more attempts, but definitely a lot of suicidal ideation. I have good days and bad days. But I got tired of letting depression run my life, and the guilt, anger and embarrassment I still carry with me everyday of having two failed suicides... Or as I like to call it now, successful living. As well as every person I grew up with, went to school with, entire family. Everyone knows. Some deal with it better than others. |drug|alcohol
I have never attempted suicide, but I have a friend. Let's call him X.[BK]X and I met while he was in a very dark place, over the internet. We have now been friends for three years, and let me tell you, he pulled himself out of a very, very dark place. He would attempt suicide at least once a month and every time he ended up in a hospital with annoyed parents and nurses watching him so he would not fuck with the tools. X still struggles today but as far as I know has not tried to kill himself in several months. I love him with all my heart (heh, gay) and so does his boyfriend (double gay.) He had, during attempts, cut his arms, overdosed, and jumped from his roof at least once. But he LIVED.[BK]And I get to meet him for the first time soon, and I cannot wait, and neither can he, and I am going to hug the hell out of him.|cut|drug|jump
I was pissed at myself because I could not do it. Of all the simple things in life, disrupting the delicate processes that govern and maintain a human life should be laughably simple. There are dozens of ways to do it and good people die by fluke accidents every day. Why should I manage to survive by luck and chance and grace when I have wanted to die so very much?[BK][BK]I was so upset, despairing and distraught, it was just this simple little thing and I could not even do that. All I had to do was slide the sharp metal a mere 2 or 3 inches between my ribs, easier than cutting a steak, and I could not do it. Hell, all I had to do was hold the knife and *fall*, and I could not do that, either. I was 14 when I figured that out.[BK][BK]Maintaining life is so damn hard, taking it should be so easy... But I have never managed to succeed. I cannot drown, I have been swimming in alligator-infested waters and they did not come near me, I have been within 12 feet of wild bull moose and grizzlies and yet I am untouched, I have been shot at and I have put myself in harm's way so much... Just by existing. I work dangerous jobs, I have lived in dangerous places, and my body itself should have killed me already. I cannot even bring myself to shoot myself because it would leave a mess for whatever unlucky shmuck finds me.[BK][BK]But I am a stubborn one. If I cannot kill myself, I tell myself I will just have to make the world a better place, a place I can live in safety and be free to be myself. It's the work of a lifetime, and it hurts... But I try to help other people as best I can, and I try to be useful, and that makes me feel a little better.|cut|drown

Woke up in a hospital with my parents next to me. They did not say a word but I felt so ashamed and realised how selfish I was when I saw the torment in my mom's eyes. When you have your heart ripped out by your ex its it is hard to think of the people you you will hurt when you kill yourself.[BK][BK]I had a fight with my parents and ran away all while going through a tough breakup with my ex who had already posted pics of her and her new man. My friend was out of town and on vacation so he let me stay in his empty house. I am not a smart man. First I tried using a steak knife to saw through my wrist which was a very slow blood flow so that was fail number one. I then rummaged through their cabinets eating all and any pills I could find. I was watching the movie pitch black as my mind started to fade to black. In my last moments I remember having a neverending itch on my balls and I just couldnt stop scratching. I guess my friends girlfriend decided to go grab some stuff and found a dude with pills around him passed out on the floor with my pants down. Not sure how she got me conscious but I have little memory flashes of hallucinating at her house. Her dog licking my face woke me for a few moments when I look down and see spiders and centipedes crawling all over me, it was beautiful. What really sucked was the dream (I hope is was a dream) of being in hell. It was so vivid and scary I regretted everything instantly. My parents said on the way to the hospital I was telling my dad to stop running over people on the freeway and when we were at the hospital I was speaking perfect spanish and telling the nurse I was trying to gift him that buttless robe thing they put on me. When I came to, the guilt set in though. I had covered my wrist wound with my favorite checkered sweat band after I had failed the night before and it was still on there. Im sure they knew and figured they would not make it any worse by pretending they did not know what was under it, but I have a scar to this day.[BK][BK]So I guess they pumped my stomach and yet again I had failed. I got a lot of weird attention from people afterwards. My friends seemed distant and quiet. One girl told me I suck at life so much I cant even kill myself. Honesty it never went away I still do not want to live in this shitty world but it is the people who love me who I do not want to let down. I drink til I black out most nights but I keep myself alive enough so my mommy does not worry about me. I have a decent job but I live paycheck to paycheck trying to enjoy what little I can until hopefully one day I wake up loving the world again. But I will definitely never hurt my family by going through with suicide again. What really helped was my parents acting like it never happened. I dont know if thats what the doctors recommended or something. I flat out refused any pills over the years when they diagnosed me with depression and being bipolar. I figured I would just stop being a little bitch and get through it on my own from then on. They helped me move to a new city, new highschool, new problems but there will always be problems cause life is a battle and quite the roller coaster ride. Virtual reality finally getting decent and possibly starting a colony on mars has sparked an ember of hope deep down inside me. Ive also adopted a puppy which helps a lot for anyone going through anything similar. Thanks for whoever gets to read this I know I got here late but been wanting to tell my story for some time.

Some dazed combination of how? Where am I? What day is it? I tried to overdose. I was a sophomore in high school. Honestly it is a blur why because I cannot imagine now feeling so low. I snuck past my mom while she was napping on the couch and filled a plastic bag with headache pills and then some other type (cannot remember what). I stashed it in my drawer and waited for the moment to come when I knew I was ready. I got in a stupid argument with my mom two days later and sat on the side of the house with a water bottle and started taking them. I think I only got to 45 before my gag reflex kicked in. I could not for the life of me get any more down without gagging. Immediately I panicked thinking I had not taken enough to die and would be a vegetable. I called my best friend and started getting loopy, walking around the neighborhood and dropping pills behind me. My friend convinced me to go back to my house and try to throw up the pills. I instead went to my room and passed out.[BK]I woke up dazed. I remember panicking thinking I had fucked my brain up because I was so loopy. Then I was wondering what wet stuff was on the side of my mouth (throw up). And then wondering why it felt so uncomfortable between my legs (catheter). Then the next few days were a blur until they put me in an ambulance to a mental hospital.[BK][BK]I do remember I could not look my mom in the eye and it made her leave the room sobbing. The only person I would talk to is my sister. It made me realize how fucked all of my relationships with everyone were and what a shitty person I had become. I regret that I made my family suffer through that (and pay thousands for the hospital bills) but I honestly do not think anything else would have woke me up and made me stop being such a shitty person to everyone, including myself.|drug
I tried a couple times. Once when I was 15, I tried to hang myself by tying myself to a tree. But I chickened out at the last minute. Another time I tried to jump off a bridge but same thing happened. The time I came closest was with pills. I took 2 whole bottles of Tylenol and Xanax and tried to go to sleep and not wake up again.[BK][BK]It took about 5 minutes for me to realize that this was a bad idea, not only because killing myself would be a terrible loss but because ODing on pain pills is, ironically, an excruciatingly painful way to die. I was in college at the time and I went to my school's free clinic, next thing you know I was being carried off in an ambulance and they were pumping my stomach and making me swallow liquid charcoal so it would not stick to my liver. I was in the hospital for a week, first in the ER, then in a psychiatric facility.[BK][BK]I do not really remember what I was thinking about after that, other than the fact that some of my friends came 2 towns over to see me as soon as they found out what happened. Some of them did not even have cars so they had to walk or take the bus (and this was in New England in mid-January, it was fucking cold out). My dad came from about 2 hours away and gave me a couple books that I really liked to read. The one thing that really stuck with me was how much people cared about me and how much they did not want me to die. I decided life was worth living and that I could not end it when I was at such a young age. I realized how many people loved me and I wanted to be able to give it back any way I could.|hang|drug|jump

a few years ago i took a lot of drugs and drank heavily, and then i jumped off a bridge. i landed chest first onto a metal guard rail about 30ft down, and i do not remember anything until i woke up in the hospital. i had all kinds of tubes, iv's, and whatnot coming out of me, and i could not move without extreme pain. i collapsed my lungs, broke my ribs, lacerated my liver, and had a concussion, but i was still alive. the first thing i remember is just being very confused and disoriented, and i had to ask a nurse where i was and what happened. they explained what i had done to myself, and then it all kinda came back. honestly, i did not feel much of anything after i woke up (excluding pain). i did not feel guilt, regret, or anything. i just felt numb. it did not work, and i was okay with that, but i do not remember feeling saved, or especially happy one way or another. i was in the hospital for almost a week, and the best part about it was all my friends and family coming to see me. it made me happy to see how much they cared, but i still never had an epiphany from it. I am glad I am alive today, but i would not say it is because of the failed attempt. i did not learn or gain anything from it. it just hurt a lot.|drug|alcohol|jump
"I got to a point in my life where I would basically lost everything that was important to me, and I was in a lot of pain almost every day. And I was a at a point where no matter what I did, even if I succeeded one day, it would not last because problems from my past would come back to haunt me inevitably. I basically did not see a point in going on. [BK][BK]Because of the chronic pain I was in, I had a prescription for Tylenol 3s, a whole bottle of them. My roommate was out of town for the week, but he told me he would wanted me gone by the time he got back. It just was not'' working out. So I told him, 'Yeah. I will not be here anymore when you get back'"". [BK][BK]So there I was, with my bottle of painkillers, no place to live, no future, no hope, and in really bad pain to boot. I just laid in bed all morning the first day I was alone. The pills were on the shelf. I was thinking about how my loved ones would be sad if I was gone, maybe even devastated, but they would get over it. Life goes on. And at least I would not be in pain anymore. And at least I would not have to deal with how pointless life was. [BK][BK]I never ended up doing it though. Instead, I reached out to my dad and told him what I was going through. He drove over and picked me up. He did not even talk to me about it. No lectures or anything. He just started working on helping me find a new place to live. Sometimes having only one less thing to worry about is enough relief to help you go on another day. Just fix one little problem. It makes you feel a little better.[BK][BK]Though I did not actually, physically make the attempt, I still consider myself a survivor. I was pretty damn close. I even had the plan, the means, and the opportunity. But I reached out instead. I do not even know why I did. There was really no reason not to do it. But when I went to bed that night, the last thought in my head was that, yeah, life is shitty and miserable. But the great people out there who genuinely care and treat you decently no matter what make it worth the trouble, and the little sparks of joy in the darkness are as beautiful as stars. [BK][BK]I decided to become one of those kinds of people. Life might not ever get better. My situation is still only marginally improved. But at least I can make other people''s days a little better, and maybe give them a little bit of that feeling of overwhelming gratitude I felt when my dad was there for me in my darkest hour.

These arn't my thoughts. These are from someone I knew. They tried 3 times, the 3rd was successful.[BK][BK]He had aome kind of mental illness,not depression. I do not think anyway. He heard voices in his head that told him to do it.[BK][BK]I was young at the time, me and my Dad were basically lodgers in this guys house.[BK][BK]My Dad saved him the first 2 times, by pure luck. I was there for the second one, he had tried to hang himself. Once he woke up, he told us that the voices were angry that he did not get it right.[BK][BK]I was too young to understand at the time, but now I realise how awful it must be. The first thing you hear after waking up is scolding from your own head, insults you cannot block out.[BK][BK]I do not have too many details, sonce my father dose not like to talk about it.[BK][BK]In his life, he was a great guy. Amazing sense of humor, great at cooking and really nice in general. He had 2 children that he left behind.[BK][BK]I do not know why he did not seek help, I do not know many things on this topic.[BK][BK]But for anyone feeling like suicide, look for help. Even if you do not want it, do it for your loved ones, your freinds. Even your pets. Somone always loves you, but it can just be hidden.|hang|disease|drug
"'Who the fuck is this guy in my room?'"" [BK][BK]It was the EMT. He left bruises on my arm when he led me out to the ambulance. I could see all my neighbors outside to see what was going on. My second coherent thought was absolute shame and humiliation. But I also did not care much because I was still really groggy and really high on the pills I would taken. Was hoping it had still work in the ambulance but did not figure that was likely. Turns out what I would taken was not easy to OD on and they kept me fairly alert on the trip. No stomach pumping just charcoal. Worst thing I have ever had to drink and it left my stomach fucked up for days. Relief was not something I felt. My dad of course told everyone what I would done. So I had to live all that humiliation and shame again after I got out of the psych ward. Living after attempted suicide is not as bad as the moments leading up to it but it is pretty fucking close.

My brother tried to kill himself again recently. He's attempted it a few times in his life, the first time when he was 5. He tried to hang himself a couple years ago when my dad passed away suddenly. The most recent time, he admitted it to my mom but swore her to secrecy and does not know that I know. He's 32 now and I do not know how to help him. He refuses counseling and keeps suicide like a final recourse in his back pocket. No matter how well things are going, all it takes is some hopelessness and being overwhelmed by life and it is not the type of thing I am educated to handle. I do not know what to do for him and I do not want to lose my brother. What can I say to him? How do I trick him into looking on the bright side? Severe depression runs in my family. My grandmother survived the Holocaust and lived to be 93, but wanted to die every day for the last 10 years of her life and talked about it constantly. Suicide and ending everything has been a theme in my family my whole life, including from my dad, until he passed from complications due to cancer. I do not know how to help us move past the negativity. It scares me. I love my family. |hang
"I was about 14, and when I woke up in a lake of vomit, not able to move, I thought, 'See you cannot even do that right.'"" Then I thought, what if it was more extreme and I survived but was permanently paralyzed and had to be imprisoned in my own body with my depression and my abusive family forever, and what if I could not even talk? So I just wait for death instead, like everyone else- but it also gives me anxiety, knowing it is coming. I drowned once, at 17, too- I know what death is like, I can wait. I also know, you cannot ask forgiveness for a murder you committed on yourself. There is a purgatory for suicides. Just do not do it. Time is an illusion. Everything shall pass, even you, when you are supposed to. Plus, afterward, I had my stomach pumped at the hospital, and when I got home, the beating of my life from my mom for putting her through that. I then moved out at 15, and to be completely honest, I did try a couple more times after the first time- but after drowning/dying at 17, briefly, it gave me a new outlook on everything. """|drown

I tried choking myself to death with an electrical cord. I actually asked someone to kill me. There was no where for me to hang myself and i know if i tried asphyxiation, i could relax when i passed out and survive. So he actually agreed to it. He tried killing me with an electrical cord (long story about the agreement) and i just remember waking up, he was still there, and it took forever to come to. When he realized i was still breathing i heard him calling my name and i just started crying, mixed emotions of relief, sadness, failure, just a lot of mixed emotions, every time i tried (pills, gun to my temple, femoral artery). I popped three discs, nearly crushed my windpipe, and had terrible welts. My fucking boss just thought i was kinky.[BK][BK]I finally got locked up in the psych ward after getting 20 stitches on an attempt on my femoral artery.

The most recent time was last Thanksgiving. My fiancée and I had been struggling with a lot of debt, plus we both have severe depression and anxiety disorders. Her father had recently passed and she had tried to kill herself in the shower, I Found her in the tub and her mother and I took her to the hospital. While she was there the pressure from feeling like I was a failure for not being able to alleviate her pain, being in a new state with no family or friends to support me, as well as all the stress from hiding the fact that I am bisexual from everyone I Know for most of my life hit a boiling point and I cut my arms pretty bad. As I was starting to pass out I realized that I wanted nothing more than to spend my life with this woman and that if I did in fact kill myself she would most likely succeed on her next attempt. I reached over for my phone and was able to call our room mate who called the paramedics.

"Hello, I realize I am a bit late here for this comment to get noticed but I decided to share my story anyways. I moved from Sweden to Spain when I was a young lad. The bullying started already in my first year I went to school there but it escalated horribly during 6th to 9th grade. Somewhere around 7th grade I was at my lowest, mentally speaking. I was the weird Swede, under-performing in math and Spanish classes and I was small in stature. The kids and even the teachers picked on me every day. One time, my classmate pushed my neck so hard, he dislocate my neck right in front of my teacher. The teacher saw the whole thing but told my parents the same day that I hurt myself in my sleep. I just had it. I had to wear a neck-stabilizer (what is it called again?) for a month. It was so embarrassing. I was sad and angry and I felt so alone. I got no support from nobody. I decided to jump off the 9th floor later that day (where I lived back then). I always pondered on suicide since I moved to Spain, sitting on the window ledge contemplating if I would feel relief by jumping. However, that day I was determined. I came home, ate my most hated meal (lentil-soup) and went to my room. I was convinced life was against me. I was angry, sad and hated everything. I hated Spain, my parents, my sister, my classmates, you name it. I went to the window, opened it and stood on the ledge. I was so filled with anger and hate I never stopped to think, I just took one big step outside but suddenly my sister pulled me in. She said nothing during this and ran to mom to tell her what I was doing. I was sitting on the floor and my family members stood around me. I had no idea what my parents where telling me as I was so consumed by my emotions. I had one thing clear in my mind, though... I wanted to kill myself but not in front of my sister.[BK][BK]I was going to try again soon after, when my sister would go off to a camp or event of some sort but my parents 'fixed'"" the window so I could not open it and attempt to jump again. Sometimes I get flashbacks from this day and I remember this in detail. I get a clump in my throat thinking about this day, still.[BK][BK]A year passed, the bullying continued but my parents told me I may go back to Sweden the year after if I get passing grades. So I decided to stay alive because I had hope that Sweden could give me back the happiness and hope I lost. This might sound like a cliché but when I started high-school in Sweden, all my sadness was gone. I felt free. My grades where doing better than ever, I had good friends and was never bullied.[BK][BK]I am glad to be alive. I have done some traveling, seen beautiful places and got myself a wife from Canada, who is my everything.[BK][BK]TL;DR: My first conscious thought was to try to jump again from the 9th floor but not in front of my sister"""|jump

I was in a long distance relationship with a girl I met on MySpace. Didn't work out but that is not important.[BK][BK]One of her friends would call me to talk about her troubles every once in a while. She had a boyfriend in the UK (we live in the US). She was kind of nuts. Didn't allow him to have any friends who were girls. Stuff like that. Although I do not know how she mediated it since he lived across the pond. I played halo with I am online a couple of times. He was really nice. It did not work out with them though. That's when things got bad.[BK][BK]She was already pretty depressed. She cut her self ect... But him breaking up with her sent her over the edge. And since I was the only person she really talked to, she latched onto me. [BK][BK]She called me one night and calmly told me that she was going to kill herself while I was on the phone with her. She claimed to have fallen in love with me, and if I did not love her back, she would swallow as many pills that she could find. So I did the only sensible thing I could think of. I told her I loved her, which was a lie. [BK][BK]But that did not stop her. A couple days later she called me and told me she had went through with it. That as we spoke she was probably dying. I managed to convince her to let me call a suicide hotline for her. The lady on the phone told me to call 911. Only problem was I did not know where to tell them to go. I lived in Florida, she lived in Ohio. And she was not calling anyone. Finally I got her mom on the phone and she took it from there.[BK][BK]I do not really know how she turned out after that. I broke contact with her because I could not handle being friends with her anymore. It was too much for a 14 year old to deal with. I do hope she is ok now.

'Fuck I am in hospital..why?'[BK][BK]Took me a while to remember I would overdosed, my stomach hurt so bad I thought I had appendicitis|drug
I just cried, harder than I have in my entire life. I just wanted to be done but I was convinced that life was just trying to continue screwing me. [BK][BK]I swallowed every damn pill I owned (a wide variety due to being medicated for bipolar, depression, anxiety and a few other random meds) but a friend found me slumped against a basement wall covered in my own vomit. He took me to the hospital and they immediately pumped my stomach. When I woke up I was devastated. I was mad at my friend for not letting me die, but more so I was mad at myself. All I could think was how could I have been so stupid, I was already planning how my next (and final) attempt would go, how I would make sure I never had to walk this planet again. I thought surely nobody on this planet was drowning in pain and misery the way I was. Until I saw my mom crying.[BK][BK]That's when it all shifted, my perspective became a little bit more clear all at once. The pain I was feeling? It was nothing compared to the pain she was having to deal with. Seeing her youngest daughter laid up in a hospital bed because she tried to kill herself. I knew from the way she looked at me (but never at my face) that I would caused her more pain than I ever actually experienced. [BK][BK]I vowed to never do that to my mom again. After a stint In a mental hospital for the suicide, pill problem and eating disorder I spent months trying to win my mom back. Eventually her hugs became a little bit tighter, she started laughing again, and it was all worth it. I lapsed a few times with the pill problem and the eating disorder but that was it for me, I was done with trying to be done with life. I wanted her to be proud of her little girl and feel she did not fail. [BK][BK]Unfortunately she passed away while I was still battling the eating disorder, but she did know I was on the final road to recovery. It's been 8.5 years since my suicide attempt, and even with my mom being gone I am never looking back because who i was is who I never want to be again. |disease|drug|drown
Disappointment, followed closely by hangover. I had knocked back a few shots of gin, taken almost two dozen vicodin, and then chugged another pint of straight gin. Judging from the state I woke up in, I rejected the gin and barfed everything back up before passing out on my floor. There was no joy at being alive, no gratitude that I did not drown in vomit, no excitement at a second chance; I woke up face down in a pool of puke with one of the worst hangovers of my life and the knowledge that not only did I feel like a total failure at life, I was enough of one that I I could not even opt out. I never got the stain completely out of the carpet and I never told a soul for about ten years. I wish I could say that things have gotten better and I now have a multitude of reasons why life is beautiful and I am glad to still be here, but despite meds and therapy I still wish pretty regularly that I would succeeded. Sometimes I wonder if maybe I actually did, and that a lifetime of depression and hiding behind a mask of humor and optimism is the purgatory I have been sentenced to for taking my own life.|drug|drown
At age 19 one feb or mars night i decided to hang myself. Tied a cord into a noose, put it over a door and closed it, i hade a pair of wireless headphones on repeating a certain song. I put a chair next to the door with the back faced away from the door. I kind of crouched down on the chair enough for the cord to cut blood flow to my head.[BK][BK]Suddenly the sound faded out into silence, i had passed out. Just as it faded out it began returning, a sharp pain began pulsating from the hip on my left sided, it took a while for me to realise i was lying on the floor, the room was pitch black, i got up and checked a digital clock i had in my room, some 20 minutes has passed since i had checked it just before passing out. Im guesssing that most of those 20 min was spent passed out on the floor. Looking at the cord and door i could see that it most likely had been damaged from the friction caused between cord and edge of the door when my body went into spasms. I was fucked up, kind of highish for quite a while after the incident and mostly confused.

My husband committed suicide 7 years ago and I have come a very long way in that time. I lost my best friend, college sweetheart, confidante and everything that has ever grounded me and the fight back was more than difficult - there are not even words to describe it. I still suffer from some residual PTSD and anxiety which I finally decided that I needed to take - I fought it for a long time. I wanted to be strong enough without it. I have often thought that I do not understand why all this has happened to me. A wise friend cautioned me recently that that why question is not helpful but focus on how to get through it. It made things clearer. I am a better person for all this - I know it in my soul. After relocation about 5 years ago, I finally took a job that was everything I ever wanted. It has not yet been a year and about a month ago with no warning, my boss starting giving me a very hard time. Feel like I am being treated unfairly and it is causing me a lot of stress, even with my medication. I have worked really hard and it all seems so unfair. I feel like I am the unfortunate scapegoat of something I could not have changed. I have meeting tomorrow that I am dreading where I am either going to be fired or severely dressed down and it is all I can think about despite by best efforts. It's hard not to wonder why this is happening - I keep thinking when will this all be enough? Haven't I gone through the enough to finally get a break? I know that is weak and counterproductive but I just want to coast for awhile. My husband saw the goodness and potential in me. I wish any of that mattered to anyone else. I am so so tired. I am trying. I am praying. He left me here to deal with all of this alone. It seems so unfair.|disease|drug

I was 22, and I had gone through a reasonably harsh breakup. She was my first. I went to the local supermarket and got strong sleeping pills. I do not know if they can actually kill you, but I took about twenty and thought that would definitely do the trick. Woke up dehydrated as fuck, and very disoriented. I do not know how much time had passed. I was still living in the house with the ex and her boyfriend (My best friend at the time) and I stumbled to get water. The only thing going through my mind was how pissed I was that it did not work. I went on that way for three years with severe depression and self-harm with frequent thoughts of suicide. [BK][BK]The day I started to love myself was just one month ago. I realized people love me and care about me and that I am a good person. My internal agony disappeared completely.

Another breakup. Funny how that works. My ex, while not right for me, she taught me how to take care of someone, and when she left I directed that knowledge on myself. I thank her for that, and now that I have happiness, I am glad my soul is still contained in this plane of existence because the world needs me, and I need it.

My story is not exactly a suicide story. I never was at the point where I was going to do it.  I thought about it, I wanted to, so many times.  There was one time which I describe as the worst moments of my life, I had reached my lowest point and before I did anything I met two important people. My best friend and my girlfriend.  I owe my girlfriend my life, she truly saved me.  The bullying passed and all I became happier then ever before.  To all the people thinking about suicide, find someone, a friend. Talk to them, it passes.  Even if you think it will never get better, it does.  I am now starting my own company to try to combat bullying and I never imagined my life could be this great!

"I was 18 at the time. This was in 2013.[BK][BK]I would just come home for summer vacation from college. I would been out as trans at the campus, and accepted by everyone there. So coming back home to my conservative catholic family...piled on top of years of untreated mental illness and the creeping fear that I would never be a good enough adult. Something had to give.[BK][BK]I would told a friend that I would run away that night and be homeless. But I was to afraid to. So, I looked up every possible way to die, then decided the easiest would be hanging.[BK][BK]Luckily, there was not any fucking rope. But I was fucked up enough to try anyway. What I did have was some really strong thickish string that I just tied into a noose and prayed would last long enough.[BK][BK]Now, you say first conscious thought. And that, honestly, makes this question really hard to answer.

The next thing I remember is gasping for breath. For a little bit, that was the only sensation I had, just forcing air into my lungs. I was on the ground at this point, the rope had broke. But I could not feel it at all. I only realized I would hit the ground later, and only because...well, I must have.[BK][BK]I do not know how long the gasping lasted. But at some point, I started hallucinating. Or something. I do not know what I would call the experience. But it is incredibly sharp in my mind.I remember I was absolutely certain that there were two other people in the room with me. I did not know who or what they were, but I did not feel unsafe or scared. Well, not by them at least. I remember I thought I had to breathe to talk to them, and I forced myself to gasp in air so I could get out the words. I begged them to go downstairs to the kitchen, because there were scissors there, and they could save me. And one of them told me that they could not do that...that I had to save myself.[BK][BK]I managed to worm my fingers between the swollen skin of my neck and the broken noose, and ripped it off of me.[BK][BK]The first completely rational thought I had after my attempt, after managing to pull myself onto my bed, was '""Why the fuck cannot I open my eyes?'""

Probably going to get buried but my first thought was that I had less of a reason to live. I broke it off with a girl I was seeing at the time so she did not have to go through any pain, this also destroyed our friendship as it turned out that she had experienced overdoses so hated me.[BK][BK]It also got me ridiculed as someone I trusted like a sister made joked behind my back in college, caused me to study from home for a month and not work for 2. It also caused me to get hooked on codeine for months which made me very out of it.[BK][BK]However it did show me that someone did care, I messaged another girl I was close to basically crying out after I had overdosed. Saying sorry, have a good life etc. The next day she called me early in the morning to check if I was okay and met with me a few days later for a chat.[BK][BK]Also someone I kayak with told me we were going out on the canal to help me clear my head. For two hours we did not talk at all just kayaked in silence which helped.[BK][BK]I forgave the 2 people who turned on me as they both apologised. However I never forgave my stepdad who never knew about my overdose but when he discovered I was off work called me selfish and never spoke to me for days. Even now as I am a big guy from powerlifting my coping method if I get stressed is to cool down as I have a huge temper which very rarely comes out but when it does can be destructive. He does not see me cooling down but yells at me for walking away from situations I do not like.[BK][BK]Not the best idea to someone almost 100kgs of muscle with a temper. One time he started shouting in my face with my mum doing nothing and me trying to reason with him. That did not work so as he was trying to intimidate me I lost it and shouted back how he would not like it if I shouted at him. This caused him to push me back.[BK][BK]Side note I have a dodgy knee due to the weights I lift and if anyone does anything to possibly hurt it, it is the only time I get physical. He also had me cornered which is not a good idea. I pushed him away, grabbed my car keys and ran out the house. I did not care about repercussions at that point I wanted out.[BK][BK]I did return hours later and agreed to be civil with him. It also drove a wedge between me and my mum as she knows why I leave and come back to stressful situations once I calmed so I can think rationally but she just watched it and did not say a word.[BK][BK]Since his mum died he has been very civil to me but I still do not forgive how he acts towards me.

I have not attempted suicide but I do feel that I should respond with something because of own experience and the experience of those who have passed through my life:[BK][BK]Suicide is a means to an end. People who consider or try have had their life wrought with pain, depression, or a great loss. Often all they want is for that pain to recede or, looking at it a different way, to finally feel better. Many of you who read this do not know what true depression is like, how crippling it can truly be. Many more, myself included, are largely unaware how debilitating certain conditions or disorders can be for the individual experiencing them.[BK][BK]All of this is just on the surface.[BK][BK]The pain, doubt, fear, loathing, and possible hatred of oneself or one's situation can bring about the darkest moments in a person's life. Suicide is often the way to stop all of that, to not feel like absolute shit any longer. I ask you all that if anyone even mentions suicide *take it seriously*. Do **not** try to talk them out of it, just stay with them and be there. Be a part of their life for the short time it takes for them to realize that maybe there are other ways.[BK][BK]Now I will not lie, you cannot save everyone. If someone wants to commit suicide and is absolutely set on doing so, there is not much you can do. But nor should you walk away. It may not be your responsibility, you may not even feel right doing it, but if you can save a life please do not hesitate.[BK][BK]If you feel like you may be at risk or know someone who is at risk you can join the community over at /r/suicidewatch or get them help from family and professionals with their permission. People have a right to live. We should reinforce that right through our own kindness and our own compassion. Be a hero, you may never get the chance again.|disease

I ended up just riding out the effects and somehow managed to survive it (Guys, please do not ever do this.) And tried to live for another year until it happened again. For the next year I had thought about what it would do to my younger sister (12 at the time) and that kept me going strong until I went to college. Unfortunately, I became addicted to them and ended up using them as a means for dealing with life.[BK][BK]The second time, I took roughly 100 pills over the course of two days. By this time I was living at college, had a different boyfriend who was as sweet as could be, and removed physically from my family. Being in a new environment with distant conversations about how I was not doing everything right with my family, extremely low self esteem, and not having any friends led me to just binge on sleep aids for two days.

It's not something I have talked about much, I think only one person knows how far I got. But for the most part, I decided to abort my attempt. I tried with pills, but about 15 minutes afterwards I could not stop thinking about my family members.

If my family was younger/healthier I probably would have gone through with it, but while I have no problems taking my own life I will not take anyone with me.

Long story short I was manipulated for a period of 6 months and raped by one of my marine corps recruiters.

My boyfriend at the time came home and found me, thought I was bullshitting until I turned blue and passed out. We're did not have a phone so he went to the apartment downstairs to use the phone. My family was never contacted (I lived in a different province than them). I spent a week in the psych ward so doped up that I did not really think of anything. I wasnt happy at having survived.

"This will get buried, but I feel obligated to share my story.[BK][BK]I was 14 at the time and a lot was going on. I was a freshman in high school and just broke up with my then gf who I adored. My parents were going through a brutal divorce and were not ashamed of throwing my brothers and I in the middle of it. We were crammed up--all 7 of us-- in a 900 sq ft house. My mother was a crackhead back then. So one day I get a call to go to my gf''s house at like 8-9pm to try to mend things. I get there after walking in the pouring rain and stood at her door as she came out to interrogate me about cheating (which I did not do). She asked if I bought such and such a flower for flower day (which I did for quite a few of my friends) and I say yes and she straight snuffed me. Still got the scar.[BK][BK]So I said fuck it. I went home, grabbed an assload of pills (fuckin Tylenol.... I was 14), set a cross beside me on my bed, prayed, and downed the whole bottle. [BK][BK]I woke up the next morning puking my brains out. My mom came in and saw 'the set-up'"" and instantly realized what I attempted to do and called poison control. After a bunch of Gatorade and a lot of watching '""EmTV'"" (back when The Marshall Mathers LP came out), I recovered. My mom and I never spoke about it since. Maybe once briefly immediately afterwards. [BK][BK]I just remember waking up and not remembering what I did to make myself so sick. I remembered after a few seconds and did not give it much thought. [BK][BK]That summer (the incident happened in April-May of 2000) was the best summer of my life. I never had so much fun and met so many new people (who are my best friends to this day). [BK][BK]I remember thinking a few months later, '""Wow. Had that attempt worked, I would not be enjoying myself this much right now. I would be missing all this.'""[BK][BK]I am now 30 years old, just married my daughter''s mother and making good money. Looking for a house to buy as of now and just enjoy life in general. Everything about it. [BK][BK]EDIT: I just wanted to add some advice to those out there that may contemplate, especially for the teenagers out there... Don''t make any impulse decisions. Life has a funny way of working shit out for everyone. After high school, you wont see or talk to anyone anymore for the most part. Just know that you have the power to make things better. Survive high school and your life really begins. Make the best of it and do not take shit from anyone.  [BK]"""|drug
When I was 14 I tried to slit my wrists with a piece of broken glass. I did not want to die, I just did not want to live how I was. I sawed into my wrist with tears and fury and sat there behind my Jr high school in an alley waiting to die. It never happened. I was disappointed but relieved after half an hour. I was bleeding but nothing life threatening apparently. I went home after that, back to the life I hated but with a slightly different outlook because I knew I did not want to die, I could not. My brother and sister needed me. Years later I was the one who had to sit in my brothers apartment with clorox wipes and rags cleaning his belongings so they could be removed after his shotgun suicide. We could not afford to have someone else do it, I hung sheets on the walls so I did not have to look at the mess and put towels on the globs of brain matter and skull fragments that sat in piles on the floor next to me, since the sofa was where he sat and it was dripping with his remnants. As I went around cleaning I saw what I thought were fillings from teeth but turned out to be the pellets from the shotgun that had lodged into the drywall and fallen out coated in white powder. There was not one area that was not covered in matter. And dutifully I sat there for hours cleaning it all up. I am grateful that I lived to be able to save my mom from having to do that. I am so angry at my brother for having done this but I also understand how low you have to feel to get to that point. I no longer have many memories of my brother other than what I had to do for him that day. My psyche could not take it, everything else except for a few limited memories and thoughts has been blocked and muddied by the sheer act of scrubbing bits of skull and brain off his belongings. Sadly I can talk about that with great detail and be so numb that I do not notice the revolted look on peoples faces. The smell is with me always, sometimes it will overpower me and make me sick. And through all of it I still feel as if it was my fault.  [BK] I share all of this in hopes that if someone is feeling suicidal just remember that almost every person that has been there and gotten past the feeling or survived an attempt has been glad that they did not do it. Times will get tough. People are assholes. Feelings suck. But its the people that are left behind will never be the same. Once its done, its done. There's no reversal. The only thing that it resolves is the temporary pain that you are in but it creates a permanent pain for those of us that are left to think about it every day. You may not feel it now but you are more important than you think and loved by more people than you realize. |cut|bleed|hang|gun
My first conscious thoughts were being really freaked out. I drank a liter of vodka, looked up the lethal dose of benadryl, took that, took a bunch of xanax, percoset, and ambien all mixed together.[BK]I heard my name being called from the shadows of my room. That night I kept hearing people call my name from different spots around the room. I had never had an experience like this, and was really scared/freaked out. I was hoping the cocktail of pills and alcohol would kill me and here I am being scared out of my mind. So I laid there, not being able to move for what felt like days, hearing people calling my name and talking to me. Also, I was extremely thirsty because of the bottles of benadryl I took. It was not a pleasant experience.[BK]Since then, I got help, started a medication, and had a lot of therapy/counseling.  For the longest time, I thought it was simply normal to think about killing yourself most days. It was something that would float around my head. Since I got help, I have not had these thoughts for quite a while. [BK]If there is anyone who is having a tough time, please feel free to message me! Letting things out is one of the most important things you can do.[BK][BK]Edit: I found out the reason I did not die that night is because I am a super processor for several pain killers and different pills. |drug|alcohol
Tried driving myself into the wall at high speeds away from public while intoxicated. Attempt was because of hidden  penis syndrome, coupled with the worst case of balanitis xerotica obliterans my uroligist has ever seen.[BK][BK]I still  think of other ways to get it done, i mean. I need surgery  that my urologist cant perform because i have a large pubis mons (pelvis, in short). [BK][BK]First thought  after i realized i wasnt successful?  I should have got an automatic. I cant drive a stick shift while drunk. [BK][BK]Seen my primary care doctor. Got anti depression medications and while its not as bad as it used to be, I am on a bit of a time limit. I have until the end of this year to somehow lose enough  weight that my pubis mons fat goes away, or they might have to do a penectomy. [BK][BK]I refuse to live that life. So I am scrambling looking for a doctor who will do liposuction  in just that area, then i can get penile reconstruction done... but its not looking promising.[BK][BK]Halp? Lol.

I was just so thankful that I did not I did not go through with it [BK][BK]About 4 years ago I was 16 and suffered with depression my whole life and after seeing about 5 or 6 different therapist I decided that I could not handle it anymore. My mothers boyfriend at the time had an assortment of guns and I decided to break into his gun cabinet and load one.[BK] [BK]I sat there with a gun to my head for about 10 minutes before I realized I would be doing more harm to my family rather than solving my issues. I knew that at some point that things had to get better. My life is great and I had a family that loves and cares about me and I could not deal with the fact that I would be making life for them harder than it should be. It felt like such a selfish part on my end. [BK] [BK]It took me over two months to confess what I did and I was finally able to get the help I really needed. I am truly thankful that I was able to convince myself out of something that I would have regretted.|gun
Tried with pills. Roomate wokea up extra early for the bathroom and found me just in time. [BK]Doctor said I was a couple hours off dying. [BK][BK]My first thought when I woke up was that of sadness and anger that I failed; even with all my family in the ER. I even harbored some resentment and hate to my roommate for saving me for a few months. This was in September last year. [BK]Now I am doing a lot better and I am really glad that I survived. Life has really started looking up finally. [BK][BK]To anyone that has similar thoughts or intentions please try to get help from anyone. Or turn yourself into a hospital. Life is worth living even through the dark painful moments, it will get better. Not over night, and it will take me effort, but it is worth it. |drug
I was in even more pain then before. I had to deal with the guilt of scaring my parents, siblings, and friends. I had to go through a week of being on a psych ward, having panic attacks multiple times a day. Found out I had bi-polar and borderline personality disorders, along with the depression and anxiety. Started seeing a new therapist and psychiatrist because I was forced to.[BK][BK]It's been a year and a half. I still want to kill myself, but I cannot. I cannot do it to my mom, who cries herself to sleep because her daughter is in so much pain. Or my sister, who blames herself because of the way she treated me as a kid. Or my dad, who I saw cry for the first time when I was in the hospital. Or to my friend, who was the one that realized my text was actually a suicide note and called me and the ambulance, and then met me at the hospital and had another friend who lived near me follow the ambulance. She is about to graduate nursing school, I do not want to cause her pain and and then not be able to finish school.[BK][BK]My mom and sister just started going to this support group for family members of people with mental health issues. They are really trying to help me, but I do not even know if I want to help myself. I do not want to be in pain anymore and I do not want to deal with being up and down all the time. I have a crappy life, I have a crappy job, the only good thing in my life is my family and friends. I do not want to let them down, but at the same time I know I will not be able to go on like this forever.[BK][BK]Tl;dr: Pain. Still hurts. Family and friends help but cannot stop me forever.|disease
"'Wow, I am such a failure piece of shit that I cannot even kill myself correctly'"". I had been a self injurer for years, punishing myself for not living up to my own expectations. This particular night I went out drinking with my roommates during college. We got back to the house and I was so steaming mad at myself I decided I deserved to die during the car ride home. Went in my room, got my box cutter and started slashing myself. I never cut deep enough to hit an artery so I gave up. That was lowest I have ever felt in my life.[BK][BK]I hope this does not get buried because self injury is horribly misunderstood. Many think its a cry for attention and I feel sometimes people use it as such. In reality you could care less about what others were thinking. You hate yourself so much that you feel the need to be punished. You punish yourself and feel a feeling of satisfaction that you are setting things right and you completely deserve it. Down the road you get hooked on the feeling of the pain and its almost like drug.[BK][BK][BK][BK]Edit: I am kinda shocked redditors are viewing the story of my suicide attempt as controversial. I am truly at a loss for words. I mean people are sharing extremely intimate secrets of their lives here. To downvote anyone other than someone trying to make a joke here is just brutal.[BK][BK]I commend the courage of others who have shared their stories. I was shivering when typing my because I had to essentially relive it again in all its shame. Probably not unlike the rest of you."""|cut|drug|alcohol
I thankfully never completed my suicide attempt.[BK][BK] I sat on my couch with a knife to my wrist and had even written a note, but then I just could not go through with it. [BK]I do not remember much from right afterwards I think I just fell asleep and spend the next day on my couch in a complete stupor.[BK][BK]I had been suicidal for awhile before this happened, I spend most days planning how best to do it in the back of my mind, if I could get my hands on a gun or if I should cut myself. I just wanted it to be fast.[BK][BK]My actual attempt kinda came out of the blue, there was nothing in particular that triggered it right then, one evening I just felt that I had had enough and could not take it anymore. I was in a pretty deep depression at the time and had recently had to drop out of my education because of it.[BK][BK]This happened in beginning of 2011 and the rest of that year is just one big blur to me now. It was not untill around the end of the year when some of my friends came to visit and saw my apartment piled up with old pizza boxes and other trash, they gave me a push to seek some help and regain some control over my life.[BK][BK]I spend 2012 slowly getting better, I even got back to my education and finished the next year. I will probably have to take some meds for the rest of my life, but that is a small price to pay, to avoid falling into a hole like that ever again.|cut|gun
the last time I attempted suicide was in 2013. I OD'd on celexa, trazodone and topomax. I woke up in the ambulance with blood ALL OVER ME, shivering and crying. The emergency worker told me they found me in the campus parking lot passed out. I did not remember calling 911 at all, I only remembered taking the pills and laying in bed. At that time I still was not sure if I was going to make it, because I was going in and out of consciousness.[BK][BK]After a few hours in the ER and realizing that I was going survive, the first thing I thought of was how upset my Mom was going to be, and how I was going to explain this to her. This had been my third suicide attempt in two months. I was so angry at myself for wanting to die but not being able to go through with it. [BK][BK]Now a few years later I deeply regret doing those things to myself, and hurting my family so much. My brother and sister have a rough relationship with me. I love my family, and I am learning to love myself every day <3|bleed|drug

When I was fourteen, I made a mistake I thought made me an irredeemable person and the only way to allow the people around me to live a normal life was to kill myself. I decided to go through with it when I was sitting in my dad's office. There was nothing around, so I stabbed myself in the wrists with a pencil, thinking it would pierce the vein and allow me to bleed out. One thing that stood out to me is that it did not hurt at all. Now if I even try to prick my wrist with a blunt pen it hurts, but when I had totally lost all my will to live, it did not at all. Once I realized I was unsuccessful, I began to feel even more useless since I could not even kill myself properly. This would lead to two years of crippling depression in which I came close to killing myself two other times. |cut|bleed

I am sorry that this is not really long or talking about things in depth, but I honestly do not remember much about the incident. I think I vomited a lot, though? I was about... 14 or 15, I think? Maybe 13? It was not a spur of the moment thing, it was not teenage angst or whatever a lot of people might call it. It was true depression, which I had suffered from since about age 10 or so, and I still have to deal with it practically every moment of my life. """|drug

I was still pretty numb when I woke up in the hospital. I had taken quite a bit of trazodone, but not as drastically as most pill stories I read. Every few minutes, if I was still conscious, I took another one. I do not even think my intention was to die, I just did not want to be conscious anymore. [BK][BK]I was dealing with heart issues around the same time, and already had a few recent ER visits for that. This visit just blended in with the others. I do not know what it was that tipped my mom off to call an ambulance, but afaik to this day she does not know that that time was different.[BK][BK]Anyway, to actually answer the question, my first thoughts were mundane. *Well, I am not dead, so I guess I am not supposed to be.* Later I felt awful, specifically towards a friend of mine who had done something similar.

I then untied the rope and cried for a while before going to the hospital.[BK][BK]I still think about it a lot, because I felt like I had no strength, and could not imagine how I had managed enough to pull myself up, outside of consciousness nonetheless.

"Relief. Plain and simple, relief. [BK][BK]I hate talking about this. It was so long ago, but it still pains me at times. I have never 100% moved on from those darkest of days, and it is a constant battle keeping the negative thoughts restrained and at bay. But, here goes... [BK][BK]In my teens, I had a few failed suicide attempts. The first few, I was not really dedicated to the cause. It was a true cry for help, and I knew it. I felt alone and abandoned even though I had little reason to. [BK][BK]Throughout my childhood I looked up to my dad. He was a hero of sorts. Now that I am in my 30''s, he is even more of a hero. The hardship he is overcome for the betterment of us kids and mum is astonishing. In my teens, it became apparent that my father and I had very different interests.  [BK][BK]He was Rugby mad. I moved from rugby to soccer, then to golf  then dumped sports entirely to chase my passion of cars. Well, being a troublesome street racer shit bag more like. I was a tech geek. He had no interest in it. I was becoming a bit of a game geek, he had no interest in any of that.  [BK][BK]Now that is probably not that big a deal to most. And I doubt it would have for me. He is a good guy, and a difference in interests would not have been allowed to tarnish a father son bond. I was the eldest son.  So I was always a wee bit jealous thinking my younger brothers had it better than me. Further to that, I was the victim of ruthless small town bullying.  [BK][BK]From when I first started primary school until after I had left high-school.  The bullying never ended. I felt let down and abused by my peers. Through primary and then onto high-school,  I always had a small set of friends.  However, primary friends went to boarding school when I went to high school.  I had to start fresh.  Eventually when I left high-school early because I was failing dismally because of the bullying, I did not really have friends outside of school. Again,  I was making new ones. This is where I feel in with the bad crowd. Really bad crowd. I was desperate to be accepted so I went along with their bullshit.  Even though deep down I knew I was being used as I had money because I worked full time, and had a car meaning transport into the surrounding cities. It was a shitty time, and it further drove a wedge between myself, and the majority of the towns citizens around my age and a little older. It sucked. [BK][BK]Anyway, one night some shit went down. I will not say what, because it was not good. Anyway, while I did not participate directly, I stood by and allowed it to happen. I wanted to stop it so bad,  but I did not.  Fuck I regret it to this day. Eventually, we all got found out. Police interviews and all that shit. Got tasked to community service. As word went around town, the bullies that were a bit older than me, came down hard. I would get jumped by groups of them when walking home at night. Lost teeth to their fists. Some of my assailants were cousins. Fuck that hurt even more. Family members hating me enough to do that. I think the brother next down from me knew what was going on. We had always fought.  Viciously at times. But during this period, he was just different. Noticeably so. Like he was trying to show love and be an awesome little brother, without making it obvious to anyone else. [BK][BK]Aside from him, I made sure no one knew how bad my life had become. I did not want to let my parents down thinking they had raised such a fucking loser. I would bottle it all up. From time to time it had all explode out violently. At school, then at pubs later in life. The switch would finally get flicked and I would explode. I would wind up getting hurt, but I always dealt some serious damage in the process. Was never proud of it. It was embarrassing.  And for some of my bullies it added to the fun.  The game became trying to set me off. How much prodding would it take until that looney cunt blows his top. Haha fun times right? [BK][BK]Anyway,  I am waffling on. I am not putting events together in a correct order etc. I guess the bonus of hitting this thread so late is its unlikely many will ever read this jumble of words. [BK][BK]First couple times, I did a shit job. Didn''t take enough pills. Didn''t tie the noose right.  Survived the drive off the cliff. Until I came to my final attempt at ending my life. I was older now. Probably 18. I had made the concious decision that this is the day I leave this world, and no cunt is going to get in the way. The plan was to overdose, and that is exactly what I did. I took a ton of pills late one evening, and then walked around behind the wood shed at home, sat myself under a big Norfolk pine and let my mind begin to close down. I did not give a fuck. I did not want to leave any lasting legacy. I just wanted to check out. No fucking note. No bullshit.  No final texts desperate to be talked out of it. Nope, fuck this world and fuck every bastard in it. [BK][BK]The final moments of consciousness I recall the porch light coming on. Dad coming outside and heading for my sleep out.  I did not really care that he would find pill bottles. I was on my way out. (God what an asshole I was. I cannot believe at the time I could not even muster some emotion for what I was about to put my family through.  I hate myself some times). Everything went black momentarily.  I was checking out. Barely popping in and out of consciousness.  I remember coming too for a bit. Dad calling out to mum. Sounding panicked.  Blackness again. Mum and dad calling my name. Clearly emotional and panicked.  Then, the moment that changed my life. Open my eyes for a moment. And dad comes clamoring through the shubs and grabs me. Tears rolling down his face. Can''t even remember what he said.  I was fucked. Something totally kiwi though along the lines of 'you fucking idiot, what have you done to yourself... come on mate'"". [BK][BK]That was the last thing I remembered until waking in the hospital. Mum and Dad right there by my side. I never shook that look on dad''s face.  The emotion on it. That moment when I realised that he really did give a fuck about me. Loved me, just like all his sons.  And that sinking sensation thinking how bloody close I came to realising it all too late. [BK][BK]I love my family. I know they all love me. While life can be a real struggle for me at times financially etc, I know I came through the pits of despair and came through the other side. Despite ALL of that, depression sneaks up on my a lot.  I am in my 30''s now, and at times I still have to fight back the urges to just let the darkness take over, and finally check out.  The main thing that prevents it is knowing how much pain I will put my family and girlfriend though if I did it. I do not want to find out there is an afterlife and have to live in the knowledge I destroyed the hearts of so many.[BK][BK][BK]Anyway, there is my story. I do not know why I told it on Reddit of all places. Just felt like it was time to get it all off my chest.  I am so emotional now. Sad in a way.  Feeling like a failure of sorts. But, also a little relieved.  And proud looking back, and seeing how far I have come. [BK][BK]Anyway  thanks reddit for allowing me the space to let that all out. I think I will look for somewhere on Reddit to talk about this stuff more regularly. I think it might be beneficial. [BK][BK]Edit: an amazing redditor sent me a deep and heartfelt pm that has me feeling a bit better. Talking about such things brings me back to a darker lonely place I try to avoid wherever possible. You, the awesome people of Reddit, make it much easier for myself and others to open up about such thoughts and emotions, thanks to your genuinely caring responses.  So, thanks guys. You''re amazing <3"""|hang|drug|jump

I realized that no one gave a shit if I lived or died as I spent almost three days out of it, puking my guts up only managing to stay alive because I ended up passing out on my side and did not drown in vomit.

I was told to stop being a whiny bitch about everything when I told her what I did and to knock it off. She then left to go visit her pedophile husband in jail because that is what you do when your grandkid tries to kill themselves.|drown
Oh man... I was very suicidal and had a few near death overdoses. One I woke up and pulled my iv's out and walked off, I got pretty far and got arrested and sent to psych. That was memorable because I got down the street.[BK][BK]One was very surreal. I woke up in hospital and the strangest feeling come over me. I slowly came back online starting with hearing and sight, then I could move my feet and hands. I was so shocked to be alive, not in a bad way at all. Sort of dumbfounded but relieved because I had insane night terrors. You're memory of events can trick you, especially with drugs, but in the darkness I felt something pushing me, trying to drown me and I could not breath but I was fighting it and did not have strength. Like a dream when you cannot clench your fist. I felt myself dying in the realest way, i was in the complete darkness, just 'okay, heart, beat, breath, you can do it, beat again and breath and you you will be fine' for what felt like days. It felt like 50 years, I swear on my life. I knew I was surrounded by lots of people in my house at one point. I was awake and talking to a doctor for half an hour before I touched my head and realized I had stitches all over and I had blood all over me. They'd cleaned it off my head and chest but sort of smeared it all over, I saw myself in the mirror and it was like a horror movie. Just in the sense it was so shocking and did not feel real and the stitches just looked like make up.[BK][BK]It still does not feel real and I do not have too many people to talk about it with, without sounding like a kook. I will open up more about my life one day but it is too soon and it got so dark for me for a little bit.[BK][BK]I did not start learning to love myself until the very moment I lay dying, what happened that day and in the months following was nothing short of life changing for me. It made me a believer in some kind of love energy that most people seem oblivious to, I feel enlightened in a way. I rearranged my priorities and I have been healthy and good to people around me for the last two years.[BK][BK]I am really happy with myself but I have a lot of issues, you would never guess though, I am doing really well and look great. I feel a lot more alienated from society, just in that I felt something and feel I know a secret I cannot share. I want to help other people but you cannot make them feel. Sometimes I feel like some sort of little godling and wonder how I have been so lucky my whole life, skirting death. I think when you grow up surrounded by tragedy, it is easier to find beauty in life, so I cannot say this is due to my experience but a reflection on my life when I got sober.[BK][BK]Ive got tears in my eyes. Anyone can do it. Anyone can change their life around and you do not need to die! You will find love or you will find a way and I promise, if you want to die young you can change your attitude/behavior and start to feel younger everyday! You'll hope to die younger than you are! Life can be meaningless but it doesnt mean it is not beautiful and you are not a tiny piece of this energy we all share. Most of us will die screaming, no matter how nice we are on this earth, is the reality. You do not get to choose your death, I have probably been saved for a much slower/violent one, but I will sure as fuck use newfound control over my life to choose to smile, maybe if I do not even feel like it, and try to be good while I can. This thing on earth is too short to be a shitty example.[BK][BK]I have lost a lot of friends to this darkness and I wish they knew that the darker it got, the higher the potential. You do not see the good without the bad, when you have seen the worst you you will be able to find happiness very easily in the things and people around you if you can learn to bend your willpower and change your ways. If you try with all your heart, you will come out a well rounded person. You will be told this by people close to you, which feels so relieving. When you take care of yourself, people take care of you. When you put good energy out and trust in yourself and your decisions good things will just flow into your life. [BK][BK]I elaborated on the question, I wanted to tell a bit of my story in case someone out there is looking for some hope. A lot of the responses were pretty negative and these people are still afraid, we are all better than that.|cut|bleed|drug|drown
"'Fuck I am still here'"" [BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]I almost do not want to share this because I do not know if it is helpful for people who are going through it right now. But I have seen and read so many accounts of people who changed their mind when it seemed to be too late, or realised all their problems were insignificant once they were almost dead. But that did not happen to me.[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]When I started vomiting blood and bile, all I could think was '""I really hope I am not throwing up the pills right now'"". I also felt disgusting and ashamed, but I did not want to live and I did not change my mind. When I woke up I was covered in blood (some from vomit, but a lot from my arms and legs which I would absolutely shredded with a blade.) there was sick all over the floor and in my hair, and my clothes and face were wet with tears. I was a mess, and I felt like I would fucked up my life in every possible way, and I have never felt so disappointed or disgusted with myself than when I properly realised it had not worked. [BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]And honestly I would have loved that to be a wake up call or the moment I changed, but it was not. I felt that same disgust for some years afterwards. To me, that was confirmation that I would never be happy, and that I would never settle into life in the way that everyone else seemed to. I just accepted that I would never be happy, and that I would never stop wanting to die. I cannot really explain why I thought this. I just believed there was something inherently wrong with me, an illness, or something about who I am as a person, which meant I would always feel suicidal. [BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]If I could go back and meet this younger version of myself, I would give her such a huge hug. But I do not really know what I would tell her. I do not know what it was that made everything finally click. I do not know what is happening in my brain now that was not happening then. I think I just finally realised that it is down to me. Of course you cannot think your way out of depression, but you can learn how to cope with it better, and eventually how to combat it. Over time I completely changed my attitude. Depression still plagued me, it was still there in my head, but I found ways to make it quieter, and ways to make it hurt less. Very, very, slowly, I even found ways to be happy. I realised that my happiness was my responsibility, and I could not just sit there waiting for depression to leave me. And I can honestly say now that I am a very happy person, I enjoy life, and even during stressful times I am ok and I can dea with it while still being happy in myself. It took a long time to get here but it was the most worthwhile thing I ever worked on. Being happy is pretty much the best thing you you will ever be. [BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]There''s a quote I found during that time which I really like: '""no matter how far from the truth we are led by histrionics and lies, the truly, objectively beautiful remains untainted.'"" I thought about that a lot and I still do. No matter how bad things get, no matter what awful things my brain throws at me, there is objective beauty in this world which can never be taken away. I worked really hard to see it everywhere. Flowers, the moon, my cat, my mum, strawberries, anything at all. I just reminded myself that to me, these things will always be beautiful, and my depression could not stop that. Eventually it was less hard work to find beautiful things. I saw them everywhere, and I still do. [BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]Another is from Oscar Wilde '""the only reason for a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.'"" When I first discovered that quote I believed myself to be useless. This quote made me smile. Everything here is useless really. The only point is to love things and sometimes to let them love you.[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]I am happy to be alive. Im happy to be here with all these beautiful things and people. If anyone out there is having a difficult time with suicidal thoughts, or depression, please know that it can get better. Please know that I love you very much and you are a beautiful thing that I am proud to share a planet with. [BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]**EDIT:** I really did not expect such a huge response to this. I am honestly overwhelmed by it and I do not know what to say. To know that a really awful time in my life has ended up helping people a little bit is really humbling. Those years of my life were pretty much wasted, but now it feels like they were worth something. Thank you so much to the people who shared your stories with me. I will be responding to everyone personally because this has all affected me a lot. You really are all amazing, and it made me cry to see so much love being shared in the comments. It''s so lovely that such a negative premise has created so much positivity. Thank you all![BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]**EDIT AGAIN:** I am sorry to keep adding to this but I really am blown away by all of this. Thank you for the anonymous gold.

"I used to have a horrible cocaine and alcohol addiction. Add into that an extremely emotionally abusive gf at the time and it was a true recipe for disaster. I lived in Hudson County NJ at the time, which is right across the river from NYC(I lived half way up between the Lincoln tunnel and GWB). We would get high and drunk, fight, and then I would wander around all night. [BK][BK]I made the walk up to the GWB several times but always turned back. Well after one particularly bad marathon binge and subsequent fight I decided this was it. I grabbed the bottle of Jack, stopped by my dealer for one last gram, and walked upto the bridge.

[BK][BK]I start walking across the bridge, and how I was not stopped idk(I walked past some cops on the footpath and I know I looked like k did not have all my with about me).

Never told anyone about this before, but I guess threads like this are a good place to kind of put it all out without freaking out friends or family. [BK][BK]One night I would decided that enough was enough stress from work and school. I put my earbuds in, put on some soothing music, and tied a plastic grocery bag around my head with some rubber bands. I was so out of it that I did not notice the bag had a tear in it. I ended up falling asleep from a fair bit of Xanax I had taken, but then I woke up the next day feeling even worse. I sat around the house for the rest of that day feeling like the biggest failure. |cut|hang|drug

"'This is gonna be a bitch to clean up.'""[BK][BK]I will share my experiences as candidly as possible.[BK][BK]I have only tried to go in a private way, if that makes sense. No gory mess, no hanging, no splat. I know if I survived that, that overwhelming felling would be unbearable. [BK][BK]The first thing that always comes to my mind is the overwhelming feeling of shame, humiliation, and failure. I had one job and I fucked up. I wake up and this feeling washes over me and I lay there shaking, crying, and ripping away at my skin. After shaking comes the vomiting. Anything and everything comes up. I beg myself to keep it in. I am convinced that if it stays in, perhaps even for a few moments longer that I will die. I beg and plea, covering my mouth and forcing myself to keep swallowing. Just swallow, breathe, swallow, breathe.... I hold my breath. 30 seconds go by and I begin to feel pain, 60 seconds and my face is turning red, 2 minutes the pain is becoming unbearable. I am determined to keep it in. 3 minutes, 4 minues I break. I gasp for air and continue swallowing. At some point the act of swallowing becomes too laborious, too painful to continue that everything comes gushing out. In that moment I wish I had more resolve, to continue swallowing, persisting through the tearing of my throat and the blood trickling into my stomach. I wish enough of the pills and alcohol were absorbed into my body to finish the job. I have struggled enough to get here, I want it all to end. I lay soaked in a pool of my own blood, bile, and tears. I think if I can lick up even one pill I will die. Eventually more gushes out of me. I am defeated. I have failed. A second wave of shame washes o er me as I lay weeping, begging every god that I have never believed in to have mercy and end my suffering. Every minute crawls by, eventually turning into an unknown number of hours before I am even capable of moving. I wake up again. Every joyous memory floods through my mind. I smile. I am thankful I have failed. I think of times I have spend at work or with friends, times that I have laughed and smiled. I think of times that have been rough and I realize that there is some way to get through it, there is something that is perhaps better at the end of the road. Maybe it will not be better, maybe if will just be over and that will suffice. A few months, perhaps years later I am at the beginning again. It''s maybe that I do not want to die, it is that dying would solve everything. I would not have to deal with anything, I would not have to go through this again.[BK][BK]For those that might be wondering. I have attempted 17 times. I have been taking medications for the past 19 months, seeing a psychologist and phychiatrist monthly. I might go through electro-convulsive therapy in the future. I have not attempted since seeking help. [BK][BK]To anyone else who is suffering, all I can say is that things will get better. Not today, not tomorrow, maybe not for a few years. They will not get better instantly. It is a slow progress towards ''better'', whatever that is for you. There will inevitably be slip ups and falls along the journey, but you will get there. When you are in a suicidal and major depressive state remember that whatever circumstances you are going through can be resolved or taken care of in one form or another. You are not weak. Seeking help is not weakness. It is simply seeking help. It is acknowledging you need help beyond what you can provide yourself with. If you choose to take medication, it will take a very long time. Not only do you have to find a medication that works well for you, with minimal to zero side effects, you have to get the right dosage. You might have to try upwards of 10 medications, and perhaps even combinations. It takes time, you have to slowly build up the dosage. Believe in yourself. Believe that some day you can get to a place that is ''better'', whatever that means for you.[BK][BK]"""|cut|alcohol|drug|drown|bleed|hang

This will probably be buried, but while I have had suicidal urges for as long as I can remember, I did not make an attempt until I was 32. That was in December. I really did not want to fail or to make a mess, or have to go to the hospital if I were found. These were all things I considered because even in suicide, I over think things.[BK][BK]I did not have a good place for hanging, and since I am quite overweight, I did not want to risk the mess of decapitation. I do not own a gun, and that would also be messy. Poison is usually ineffective, and I knew I would probably get scared and call for help. Gas is dangerous and could harm others.[BK][BK]I finally decided on aphxiation through helium. Most people who choose to go this way have to do a lot of research and planning to be effective. If I had had to leave my house, I knew I would lose the nerve. Because of my line of work, I was able to cobble together an apparatus that I thought would work in about an hour.[BK][BK]I knew my husband would be devastated, but my mind convinced me that he would be better off without me. He was getting quite handsome, he has an adorable dog, and I felt like women would be throwing themselves at him if I were not in the picture. [BK][BK]I felt like I failed my clients, and even though I knew a lot of people and was even a little famous in my line of work, I looked through my contacts and could not think of anyone who I would feel comfortable calling. I look somewhat professional and can put on an incredibly happy face, but that has only been through years of training and enormous mental effort. I had come to the point where I just could not pretend anymore.[BK][BK]A sick brain can rationalize anything. Anyway, when I actually made my attempt, I choose to do it in my garage so that my husband would not have to find me on our couch. I got everything set up, turned on the gas and very quickly faded into darkness.[BK][BK]When I came to, for one of the first times in my life, I was not thinking. I was just feeling. I felt terrible; my head ached and I was drenched in sweat. I stumbled inside, threw up and just sat on the floor of the bathroom. My legs did not want to work, but I forced myself.[BK][BK]The my phone rang. It was one of my clients calling to make sure I would be there in 3 hours. That put me on a mission. Somehow I decided that I could do my job and I started preparing to do so, even though I felt like shit. I took a shower, got dressed and did everything else I had to do for work.[BK][BK]I told my husband later that night and he is helped me to get help. I was really careful to choose method that did not leave physical scars, but my body was achy for about a week. Id never been actually treated for depression, but I had been non-compliant for several months for a thyroid condition. I really dislike going to the doctor, so I would avoid going at all costs, which was why I just stopped taking my medicine when it ran out.[BK][BK]I actually just recently found a word that describes how I was feeling: acedia. Its basically a 4th century monastic word for 1st world problems. Part of my despair had been guilt for my own success, and the feeling that I was not doing enough for the world, since I knew I was capable of more. It's a hard headspace to describe, but it is nice to know there is a word for it.[BK][BK]My doctor got me back on my medication and prescribed me zoloft. Nothing really changed, but my husband and I started making little changes. We started walking every night, eating healthier and talking to each other. The biggest thing that happened was that I actually wanted to take care of myself. I started looking for a more meaningful job.[BK][BK]The biggest change for me happened when I started doing yoga and meditating. I never have been very successful at turning off my brain, but there really is something to the breathing patterns that works. I need to do this alone, to music to be effective, but I am incredibly energized and focused by doing this. I am not saying that yoga is right for everyone, but I really believe that connecting with my body has helped immensely. I have lost about 20 lbs so far with no real effort, but I still have a long ways to go.[BK][BK]Anyway, this is long. But my real lesson that I learned was that it is okay to ask for help. I am incredibly fortunate to have a lot of freedom, so I need to take advantage of that and do more. I am making big plans again and it feels amazing. I might fail, but nothing that happens to me can be any worse than what I tried to do to myself. Yes, I failed at suicide, but it was almost like I killed that inner voice that was constantly telling me that I was worthless and did not deserve what I had in life.[BK][BK]I know this is long, but I hope it helps someone else. TL:DR failed suicide, got help and a new outlook on life. Edit-spelling |hang|drug|gun

 I am late here but yeah this is my story. I did not really do straight up suicide attempt, I first went for a full walk for some part of the city from morning to night and came back at night. I do not know why but I just walked the whole way looking at everything, the people and the next day I took some clothes and some money I saved up and got on a bus.  This is a 3rd world country so I could not really escape to  another state. My plan was to go to wild part of the world and just die there while enjoying some moments of my life left to me.[BK][BK]After almost 200 miles away I got off in a middle of nowhere and lied to the driver my family had estate around and just went to the forest. I had really warm clothes and it was spring almost early into summer.  So I got to the forest and enjoyed the sense of being alone where no one could see me you know? It felt so good and scary but at the same time... so free.[BK][BK]I walked about 5 miles off the road and came by a small waterstream in the forest, just put off my backpack. I had a very scarce food, embarassed to admit I only brought a premade food and ate a food while we were going on the bus (bathroom break with restaurant) and only a big can of Pringles with a jug of Cola. [BK]I did not plan to live there forever so it was fairly simple, I brought something I would enjoy and not last for long. That day I set up my things and ate half of my food and just sang like a crazy person doing stupid things because no one could see or hear me.[BK]I enjoyed myself, I masturbated and just did everything you could do. After some time, this things have decayed I felt very alone, forest was silent. I was not afraid of the night but that terrible silence actually got weird, summer was not exactly there yet so bugs were not out and birds seem to have avoided me.[BK][BK]I went onto different set of enjoyment, the subtle feeling of where I am and the raw nature that I am in. Felt good to be honest, I got my big winter jacket out and used it as a blanket and my backpack as a pillow and slept. Woke up in the morning at like dawn, it was fucking cold and I was all soaked up in damp on face and my pants, my winter jacket held out most though.  I knew it was not enough and planned to make some kind of roof just so I will not get damp because I hate that feeling. [BK][BK]I had nothing to do, so I just tried to wake myself up a little and ate the remainder of my food and went on for the shelter. I thought I could just build roof but abandoned that idea because damp would be everywhere so I made a little shelter out of dead branch, dry plant, whatever it is I am not sure what its called in English.  I got a really shitty shelter done and slept in it, it was pretty good. But that day I was thorougly bored and just went to look for the landscape.  I went onto this mountain range and inbetween one of those I saw a fucking deer, I was really lucky but I startled it and it went up like a bastard and run like hell after being still for awkward long time. I felt good seing those things but I was kinda worried about wolf now but at the same time thought it was better if I die faster. I went back but could not find my shelter for few hours then came in at night and slept.[BK][BK]I was so hungry the next day waking up, my Cola was out and I drank from the waterstream. So bored, no wolf. Thought about hanging myself but I did not bring any rope or something I could use. I had a belt but I did not think about it a time cause I am an idiot.[BK][BK]I lived there for about a week and a half then when I was fucking around I got spotted by a jeep. It was apparently an equalievent of ranger in here searching for me with the police. My parents had posted search notice to police and reported it. Apparently they searched for bus station and my equal of Social Security was recorded there on a bus, tracked the driver down and asked me where I got off. They had been searching for 3 days till they found me. [BK][BK]Coming back was the most shittiest feeling, I was kinda happy to be back but I wanted to die peacefully there in the forest. I did not like how they would be scared and shit. I met up with them in a bout an hour after the spotting. They were in their car searching as well, got a mouthful and rage. I got on the car and we had the longest fucking conversation ever.[BK][BK]Anyways we kinda got the commonground after that, I was an underachiever but when I came back I took some time off and worked a little then went full time. I have a better life now, I live alone and I love it. [BK][BK][BK]Sorry if that was a long one, but that is what happened to me. It was my twisted attempt of suicide or just dying peacefully while enjoying my time. I did not think much of hanging there or otherwise I would have but yeah. I just thought I would die of starving, but I guess you can do much fkin more when you are in the wild.[BK]I did not eat anything after the day 3, went on water and some plants that looked safe at the time ( but I think I just ate it to feel something other than grumbling)[BK]|hang|vehicle|alcohol
Pretty much just more ashamed. I was bullied severely for the way I looked and was raised and I tried to hang myself but the rope broke. So that just confirmed I was a fat cow who is hair was like a horse and all the other mean shit people said about me. Much like the top post right now, it was not like something clicked right after that that made me feel better. After my dad died my freshman year of high school and the news spread, people stopped bullying me and just ignored me instead. And after lashing out for awhile I got over it, identified that my depression was environmental and got the fuck out of state as soon as I graduated high school. No regrets.|hang|drug
"I did not think of a phrase, I was simply bummed out. As I came to, my internal monologue was like 'no, no, no, no, I fucked it up, this cannot be!'""[BK][BK]I was sure I took a lethal dose. As background, I was undergoing negligent psychiatric treatment against the advice and will of my wonderful psychologist. I took several pills, the main were a large blue one to normalize an anomaly in brain waves caused by irreversible brain damage to the right front lobe. The other two were an antidepressant and clonazepam. I was very depressed for many valid reasons, going through the darkest point in my life, and therapy was giving me a glimmer of hope that the medicines provided by my apathetic toad of a psychiatrist extinguished. [BK][BK]After a long period of slowly losing what I liked about myself and one too many disillusions in my love life, I decided the daily struggle would not improve significantly and I was no longer willing to put myself through it. I fancied the idea of the ultimate rest for my weary soul, the end of my sorrow through my autumn leaf landing. [BK]I was taking a massive dose of 8 of the largest clonazepam pills available per day, but that night I took more or less 70 pills, all that I had left at the time. With every nightly dose, I felt an overwhelming cloak of lethargy lull me to slumber within minutes. I felt it so much stronger than any time before and I dedicated my brief next minutes to cherishing that which had been good in life and making peace with my departing. [BK][BK]Around 18 hours later, I woke up still immersed in deep mental fog though acknowledging my continued existence, and it took several minutes before I was able to formulate my first thoughts about it. [BK][BK]Immediately after, I ceased taking all medications against all medical orders (I know now it was quite dangerous to quit them like that, but to be fair it would not have made a difference at the time, more encouragement even), only to endure several torturous weeks of adapting my body to live without benzodiazepines. [BK][BK]Today I do not feel the depression I felt. I do feel I have a depressive personality beyond my social mask, one that dwells deep inside and I allow only for myself to see. I have never felt I belong in this world, even in times of joy when I felt loved and generally in plenitude. There was always this ghost gnawing at me, occasionally reminding myself of its permanence. I simply do not belong here. [BK][BK]But I have found certain focus that keeps me going. In this thread is an amazing post that invites us to recall the inherent and objective beauty in this world. This is a wise thought, and though I probably could not have simply externalized it in any manner, let alone such an effective one, I believe that too is what keeps me alive today.  """|drug
"'How much longer do I have to keep pretending...until I can try again?'""[BK][BK]I tried to over dose in my teens.  I had high grades at school, a group of friends, parents who were supportive, a job that had great coworkers... On the outside, I pretended that everything was fine. No one ever knew or suspected that at the end of the day, I was kept awake at night  by thoughts of how useless I was, how I was a disappointment, how nobody would care if I disappeared, how great it would be to die in my sleep...

I felt like a sack of shit for putting her in that position, but was happy that it was going to be the end. I kept puking and and drifting, puking and drifting waiting and waiting. [BK][BK]At 10 years old she called 911 to get me help after she noticed all the empty bottles and cuts all over my wrists. [BK][BK]The next bit is fuzzy: the ambulance picked me up, I was taken to a hospital, one of my parents'' friends who worked in The ER recognized me and called them... I was shocked and amazed that I was not dead yet. I kept telling them not to bother calling my parents, because I would be dead soon anyway. [BK][BK]My parents came and were devastated. I drifted. I guess they pumped my stomach and whatever else they had to - because I woke up. What the hell was I still doing here. [BK][BK]I finally told my family my thoughts, how it had been months and they did not notice. I wanted to pretend to seek help long enough so that I could make another plan and try again. Until my sister walked in the room and threw her arms around me. I could not believe I was going to do that to my sister, let alone anyone else.  I got help after that. [BK][BK]The next few years were hard. I struggled as hard as I could to never do that to my family again. Some days were good. Lots were bad: many days I could not wake up, Many sleepless nights of self hatred.[BK][BK]During that time, everyone around me told me they loved me, that they were happy I was still there, and a lot of other caring words. I filtered them all out. I could not hear them. They were not true words. They did not really mean it. [BK][BK]I tried a lot of treatments and prescriptions before I finally started to feel better about myself again. I[BK]I am here today with a beautiful family. A home and a car that we own. Another great job. [BK][BK]If you are going through a hard time, keep trying. It''s so easy to stay the same and hate yourself. It''s even easier to end it. Just remember that there is always going to be someone devastated of your passing, even if you do not know it right now. [BK][BK]Sorry for any weird formatting.

"'It hurts so much'"". [BK][BK]Referring to the emotional pain, not physical.  My mother had walked into the room right as I was about to attempt suicide, I was about to cut my wrists at 11 years old.  I only remember my mom holding me and telling me she is going to get me help. """|cut

"This is about a friend of mine who i helped. I suppose it is loosely relevant but it might help any of you going through this or if you need to help someone. [BK][BK]Basically around about 10pm i got a call from my friend. She sounded upset and sad and just wanted someone to talk to. [BK][BK]We talked for a bit, and i do not remember exactly what sparked my comment, but it apparently helped her out immensely. She was talking about how she just seemed like a burden on people, and that she couldnt find anything going well in her life. I told her something along the lines of 'at the moment, yes. You are sad and you are latching onto people who do not want to hang out with a depressed person. It is draining. But i remember when you were happy and had goals and things you wanted to learn and do.  I do not keep hanging out with you because i like how you are now. I keep trying to help you get get back to where you were before. Happy and full of life. I want to help you become your old self. One who inspired others by being herself.'""[BK][BK]Basically i wanted to explain to her that in order for people to like you, you need to like yourself. I remembered when she wasnt moping around and instead was helping others push themselves. I wanted the old her back, and i knew she could do it. [BK][BK]I found out about 2 or 3 months later, after she started seeing a therapist, that when she called me she was in the bathtub with two razor blades aside her. The phone conversation was one of of a few i got from her, but that time seemed different to me. [BK][BK]She now works for Microsoft and while not completely happy with her job, is working on being happy. I think she has finally gotten to a stable part in her life, and it is still part of my life where I was happy that she called someone before she did anything. I guess I will leave with this.[BK][BK]If you are going to try anything, call someone who cares about you. If they are close enough, they can help you. They know you and will help let you live another day. There is no need to give up. Someone put there wants you to live again.[BK][BK]If you think you are getting one of these calls, think back to why you care about that person.  Think back to when you said  '"" hey, you are someone i want to be around'"". Give that back. Be there for them.[BK][BK]And finally, if you or anyone you know seems to be slipping down that abyss, ask for help. For women, you tend to have friends there for you. Hold on to those friends. For guys, talk. Say something to someone. Most men feel like they will be seen as weak for expressing anything important emotionally. My personal take. Suicide is for the weak. It is for people who couldnt find a way out and they felt they had no other options. No other way of ending this sorrow. There is always another way, and you need to find another way. You only get one life. Don''t throw it away in a rash decision or some '""well'"" thought out plan to release the burden. There are tens of options. Call a friend, call a help line, seek some help. There is always a person who will listen and who will care. Take fives minutes, and anyone can find someone to talk to about anything. We have the entire internet to help us, and we have people a phone number a way who will listen to any shit you throw at them. Hell, message me and ill see what i can do. Dont throw away this one chance you have to live your life and be happy."""|hang
"'Shit'"", basically. Then followed by anger and embarrasment. I did not want to be seen doing it.[BK][BK]My parents found me after I cut my wrist with a scalpel. Somehow the blade had broken and could not fully complete the cut. They heard a weird sound when I threw the thing against a wall in frustration in the middle of the night. I then ran outside onto the highway, with the blood dripping all over the place. [BK][BK]My father sprinted outside with a lamp to signal cars there was someone walking on the road, putting himself at risk. I walked off since I did not want him to get killed. They then drove me to the hospital and claimed I had cut myself cleaning up glass. Minutes after we got outside, my mother said I now had the choice of talking to them or we had walk back inside for professional help. I simply nodded, it was all I managed to do.[BK][BK]The next 5 days I did not eat, did not respond to anyone and just sat on the couch. I did not even hear people talking, never even saw they were there. During all that time, whenever possible one or both of my parents just sat next to me. My mother took time off work for personal reasons to look after me and get me to eat. I lost 8 kg in a week.[BK][BK]I am stable now, did the last two years and my PhD public defence is scheduled. My boss was extremely understanding. I went back to work after two months. Everyone that knows me has said I aged a lot. It''s probably true.[BK][BK]If anyone with suicidal intents reads this, **please reconsider** before you do it. If you are not sure you want to do it, do not as you will mess it up anyway and will cause yourself harm. If you are sure, reconsider as well and **talk** to people you trust or a professional helper. **It is not a shame.** When I got back to work, I was surprised to find out two of my colleagues and my boss struggled with depression as well when they were younger. I will never forget them and what my family did for me.[BK][BK]I know it is hard to make that step and open up to someone about it. I failed to do it, but try. Life does not suddenly get better. It has been two years for me and I still have moody episodes, but the time between them increases. During those my life still feels like '""the show must go on'"" instead of Louis Armstrong''s '""Wonderful world'"", but you do learn to live with it. Slowly, things improve.[BK][BK][BK]Remember, once you have tried killing yourself, you have to learn how to live with the scars, both physically and emotionally.  The white line from my lower arm to my wrist will never go away and keep reminding me of what I did. I will also never fully grasp what I put my parents through. Don''t put yourself in that place. **Talk** to someone, before you stop considering doing just that.[BK][BK]It''s the first time I ever speak about this (and type on Reddit, so sorry for the bad formatting), but if it has made one of you reconsider, it has been worth the hour it took me to write this."""|cut|bleed

I thought long and hard about whether I wanted to answer this, but I have massive scars on my wrists that tell (a) the story itself, or in some cases simply (b) the one that people are going to infer and predicate judgments on. I am not ashamed of going to battle and having come out scathed anymore, though, so here's hoping this brings something of value to someone else caught in the trenches.[BK][BK]I sliced my wrist in two lines down to the last dermal layer; I drank myself numb and capped the sensation with painkillers.

As many chances as I have had to say and think the same words, they have still never rode in on the same kind of panic that they did that afternoon.[BK][BK]*Oh, no.*[BK][BK]I had no idea what to do. I did not expect this. I panicked as I considered the next step; I was too weak, too exhausted, and just too scared to try and finish the job. I was *terrified* to go out into the world, though, because my injuries were impossible to hide; I would either bleed through my clothes or have to wear an incredibly obvious and makeshift splint. I tried to just shake it off and press on as I had in recent days; I was not going outside much anyway. I could lay low for a while and put off deciding anything, I told myself.[BK][BK]I showered, guarding my gaping-open wrist from the water. I sent an email politely excusing myself from work that day due to a personal emergency. I tried to spend the day hiding at home and processing out all the frightened and confused feelings. It did not work out. It culminated in the police coming to check on me when my absence drew concern and me getting taken off to the hospital.[BK][BK]That was not the last time I would ever sink that low, but it is still the last time I would ever attempt to end my life. This life is at times very dark, and *very* scary, but if you are reading this and you feel that same sense of despair and panic, for God's sake, do not do it.

I am not one of those impulsive suicide attempters, I planned waaay in advance, and also did a lot of prep. Not that that is any better, just different. [BK][BK]I acquired lots of Xanax, Oxycodone, GHB and also bought some vodka and ciders. The ciders were mainly just to add more alcohol into my system because I cannot really stand spirits.[BK][BK]My intention was to overload my system on CNS depressants (all of which the above are), so that I could just stop breathing. I did not even care if I aspirated vomit, I just wanted to leave. So I took 14mg Xanax, a quarter litre of vodka, three ciders, 3-5ml GHB and snorted 40mg Oxycodone to be exact. Obviously, do not ever do this, it is awful. [BK][BK]Well, I felt high for about a minute but then I was wretching over the sink. I do not think I have ever vomited in my life, it is weird, but when I drink too much or whatever, I usually just get extremely nauseous but hold it in. [BK][BK]Then immediately after it was just like complete darkness. I was completely unconscious, and it was just...nothing. I am 100% certain if I had succeeded, that would be what death is. Just nothing. I mean, who knows if you are reborn or if there really is an afterlife or something but that was my experience. [BK][BK]I time travelled a couple of hours into the future, so it seemed like only a couple seconds had passed when I awoke in a hospital bed with an IV and my parents plus lots of medical staff stood around. Apparently, I had told my flatmates that I was going for a walk and managed to get pretty far away before collapsing. I had no memory or awareness of that, and that is the scariest part to me; drugs can really mess you up, especially the ones I mentioned. Someone found me just in time; much later and my breathing could have completely stopped, and worst case scenario I would have been brain damaged. Yes, that would be worse than death imo.[BK][BK]So I was lucky, well, depending on your perspective. To be brutally honest, when I woke up my only regret was that it did not work. I spent the night in the hospital, they told me to speak to a mental health team and let me go. I am not sure if they thought my overdose was accidental or not, so they might not have considered me a suicide risk.[BK][BK]I spent the next couple of weeks recovering, sleeping days away, and I am pretty sure I have done some kind of damage to myself. Sometimes I feel drunk, I slur my words, my concentration has deteriorated, my thinking has blurred, but I only have myself to blame. [BK][BK]Reflecting on it now, I kind of think that I was just desperate and wanting to relieve the intense suffering I was going through. But there is a lot life has to offer. I want to see the world, I have so many experiences awaiting and I would have squandered that.[BK][BK] I am only 21, so regardless of your past or your situation, any death at that age is a complete waste. The only constant in life is change. I am sure I will have even higher highs and even lower lows, but I can also be sure that I will not be doomed to feeling miserable constantly. The average life span is only around 70-80 years old anyway, which is just a tiny blip in time. Cutting it short is like flipping an hourglass when there are only a few grains of sand left to fall...if that analogy makes sense![BK][BK]If you are feeling suicidal yourself, my advice is to really dig deep into those feelings. Sounds counter intuitive, but by letting yourself experience those emotions and seeing what is causing them through meditation and such really helped me. You could come to realise that it is purely a chemical imbalance, which is easily treatable. Or that it is purely situational, and like I said, that will change in time. Or a mix of both, which is still manageable.[BK][BK]Someone cares about you, and your life is precious. Keep going.[BK][BK][BK][BK]|drug|alcohol

"Well, this is my story. (TL;DR I am a homeless youth with life threatening depression, you can figure out the rest)[BK][BK][BK]I grew up in a well-off family (not like rich or anything, be we had enough) living on a 5 acre (~20200m squared) farm with my mum, dad, younger brother and sister. At the age of 8, my parents split up, and mum took us kids. We moved to the Gold Coast, Australia, where to this day, I still live. Moving to a new primary school was tough, since I was the quiet type. [BK][BK][BK]All through school, I was bullied for not having friends, and I could not make friends because everyone was an asshole. By this point, both my original parents had found new partners, and I rarely saw my dad. I have been dealing with depression since about my parents break up, but have never told either about it, because they were not the type to care, so I left it to myself.[BK][BK][BK]I told myself that I would try to make friends during high school, and I did. But my life took a huge turn for the worst after I left school. During my entire life living with my mum, there had been lies flung between her and my dad. Because of that, I had learnt to never trust anyone. The trust issues go further, but I might leave that for another time.[BK][BK][BK]The first weekday (so a Monday) after I had finished Grade 12, I had a very serious ankle injury, where I had torn almost everything in my right ankle. I was in bed for a good few weeks. While I was still recovering, my mum had told me that she does not want me living there anymore, and that I had to go live with my dad. So I moved to live with my dad, just months before my 18th birthday.[BK][BK][BK]For the next couple of months, I was living at my nan''s place (he lived with his mother due to financial troubles) where I had gotten a job. But a couple of months into the job, they had found a better staff member, so I was laid off. For about a month or two, I had been looking for more work, but nothing was suitable for me. [BK][BK][BK]Then, one morning, I woke up to my dad telling me; 'We cannot have you living here anymore, you need to leave.'"" I was given a day to pack my stuff and leave. [BK][BK][BK]It had not hit me at that point, but I had ended up homeless, with no roof over my head, no food to keep me alive, and not even a single cent to my name. As I prepared m6self for the first night sleeping alone in my car (thank FUCKING god I had a car and a license) I got a call from my mum, she had heard about what had happened, and told me to come back around to her place until I found a place.[BK][BK][BK]So I spent a day or so looking for places, until I came across a homeless youth service based on the Gold Coast; the [GCPHY](http://www.homelessyouth.com.au) (Gold Coast Project for Homeless Youth). I called them and moved into the house that day.[BK][BK][BK]Fast forward a few months, I had moved out of the Crisis Shelter (Lawson House) and moved into a Medium Term Shelter (Jessica Dunne Lodge), I had started to yet my life back on track, and I met some really great people within the system. [BK][BK][BK]There have been days/nights where I feel good, even happy, but there have been times where I have wanted to end my life. One of those nights, I felt so bad, I almost drank a bottle of Bleach. Before I did though, I had told one of the workers, and I was sent to Hospital so I would not try to harm myself any further.[BK][BK][BK]For what I thought after being sent to Hospital, my first conscious thought was; '""Maybe it was a better idea to end myself.'""[BK][BK][BK]It has been about 2-3 months since that had happened.

I have been suicidal since I was 11. My best friend and I were victims of physical, emotional and verbal bullying and it ended up with both of us self harming and I took about 15 Panadol pills (the only medicine we had left from all the times I faked sick to avoid school). It did not do much except knock me out  (my first thought after I woke up was 'why am I still here') and leave me dizzy for the next 48 hours. My self harm continued and I tried drowning myself multiple times after because I did not want to do the pills again and I did not have a convenient place to hang myself or jump off of. I am 16 now and I am 6 months clean after I realised how useless self harm is, and also as someone who is into Marilyn Manson and avenged sevenfold and stuff like that I got called Emo a lot and people would mimick cutting and stuff and it motivated me to stop.

[BK][BK]A year of ineffective therapy later and things had not improved much, I could feign laughter well enough but that cold hollow feeling never left.

When I finally did, my brother just happened to come into my room, he tackled me down before I had even registered what was going on. I have never forgotten how grateful I was to be saved, I realised how selfish it was to leave my family to grieve, how self-indulgent it was to leave it all behind and most importantly how senseless it was to throw away my only chance at living so soon. Pain, suffering, fears and doubts are only ephemeral, so why not wait them out I realised, maybe it will turn around, maybe things do get better.  [BK][BK]Three years later and I think of killing myself everyday, but there is no risk, nor questions to ask myself. I have gone as far as I want and realised that I was wrong.

"For what may arguably have been my most serious attempt: 'Why are there bees everywhere?'"" [BK][BK]I was in a psychiatric hospital and decided that my treatment was not going to work, and I just could not stand living for another minute. The hospital I was in was designed for long stays and people who were not at immediate risk of suicide (people who became acutely suicidal  while admitted were transferred to a locked SCU ward for a few days, before returning to the clinic). As a result of this, the rules about what you could have in your room were not as strict as on a typical locked ward, so nobody had taken my dressing gown sash away from me. I went into my bathroom and rigged up a setup for ligature strangulation - which I will not describe in detail - and strangled myself. I remember losing consciousness very quickly, and the last thing I remember feeling was a sense of warmth and safety and peace that I had not felt in years. [BK][BK]I do not know how much time passed (felt like forever, was probably not too long or the nurse would have come in for checks), but I just remember suddenly hearing...bees. Like, a loud intense buzzing, like there was a hive in the room. I wondered why there were bees, and then I remember clawing at myself and I must have been pulling the ligature off, because next thing I knew I was coughing my guts out on the floor. When I got a bit of sense back and realised that there were no bees, I was panicking - I had a big bruise on my neck and was terrified that if the nurse saw it they would send me off to the SCU place and that felt like a fate worse than death at the time. I also remember crying because I remembered the warm and safe feeling and wanted to go back to it and not be alive and trapped. I eventually covered my neck with my hair and took my dressing gown sash down to the nurse''s station and asked them to hold onto it for me, and then asked for my prn meds because I felt anxious. Idk what they thought, but I did not get sent to the SCU, so.[BK][BK]Equal to that attempt was the time I tried to drown myself, but that was a lot less deliberate. It was about five months after the attempt I described above, and this time I was dissociated out of my brain, and in said dissociated state I absconded from the hospital and wandered away, apparently eventually jumping in the nearby river in some weird suicide attempt (I say weird because I would definitely plan a self-drowning a lot more carefully than jumping in a river on impulse while dissociated). I have very little memory of any of this and really only '""woke up'"" from the dissociation when I hit the (cold) water, which was a shock - I guess my first thought was really '""what the fuck?'"". After swallowing and gagging on some filthy river water, I tried my best to hold on to rocks and things  and swim to the bank to get out, but the current was strong and by the time I got to the river bank I was exhausted. The river bank was incredibly steep - it was like...a four foot high stone wall, kind of? the river is in a city area - and even though I tried to haul myself up onto the pavement a few times, I could not do it. I was clinging to this pipe thing and crying, and I remember looking up at the river bank and thinking '""I could just let go. If I let the current take me I would probably drown. I should just give up on all this and let go.'"" I remember thinking about that warm/safe feeling from my previous attempt and desperately wanting to go back to that because I was so tired. I decided to try a few more times and then give up - and on the second to last try I managed to throw my leg up over the top of the bank and like...roll up onto the pavement. And when I realised that I had fucked up/chickened out from killing myself *again*, I remember just....panicking and not knowing what to do. I ended up calling my (long-term, trusted) outpatient therapist, who - bless him - drove out in the middle of the night and somehow found me based on my extremely fuzzy and incoherent description of where I was (I did not remember how I would gotten there), and he calmed me down and convinced me to go back to the hospital. [BK][BK]There were also a handful of overdoses when I was younger, because I did not really know what I was doing, and my first thought on waking up from most of those was '""Goddamnit'"", or something similar - I just basically felt pissed off and really sick. Once I attempted to give myself sleeping pills and go down to the river to drown myself (this was years before the river incident above), but I passed out on the street on my way there and ended up staggering home when I woke up several hours later. I was pissed off and fucked up about that one too, but I do remember thinking some darkly amused thoughts about how absurdly incompetent the attempt had been.[BK][BK]Wow, that comment got long. Idk if this is what you wanted OP, but thank you for making this post. I do not really talk about my suicide attempts at length with anyone - not even my therapist. I had a friend who I used to talk about this stuff with, but we kind of mutually uncoupled a while ago, and nowdays...I guess I pretend none of it ever happened, for the sake of the people who care about me. But it did happen, and these were huge horrible life events, and it feels kind of cleansing to really just...get it out of my head and tell someone. [BK][BK]"""|hang|drug|drown|jump

"I thought 'Fuck. I failed.'"" This was in September of 2015-- I would gone into an extreme manic state (based on some really awful things going on in my personal life), downed a bottle of pills, and slashed my wrists repeatedly (scars which I will always bare as labels forcing me to wear long sleeve shirts for the rest of my days) and did not want to wake up ever again. I do not know how, but my roommate knew something  was wrong (he would seen me the night before and I was a complete mess-- drunk, crying, not making sense) and kicked open my (locked) door, saw all the blood, and immediately took me to the hospital. I got thirty seven stitches across my wrists and greatly damaged my kidneys from the extreme amount of pills I had taken. I was 51/50''d and spent a week in a mental hospital. Which only made things worse as it was one of the most wretched and downright scary places I would ever visited-- condescending and unhelpful staff, being forced to share rooms with dangerous patients (my '""roommate'"" for lack of a better term, threatened to kill me repeatedly and when I reported it to the staff they just said, '""well, we will check in on you every now and then'""), hell-- I did not even see a counselor or an internist for three days (I was supposed to see one within the first twenty four hours). I was eventually discharged and diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I have since become medicated and go to therapy once a week. In all honesty? I am still most DEFINITELY suicidal, but I will never act on it again for fear of going back to a place as hellish as the mental ward where I was sent. I try to focus on the good things, I truly do-- I have a place to live, a good family, a car, a job, good friends-- but every day is still a struggle. I will never forget the look on my parent''s faces when they saw me in the hospital, I will never forget hearing my brother cry on the phone (it was the only time I have ever in my life heard him cry) when he called me in the hospital. I will carry guilt for my selfish act for the rest of my days, but I know that being free and able to live day-to-day is much better than the alternative of being confined to an institution. I am trying-- I really am-- but it is still so goddamn difficult to silence these dangerous thoughts in my head.

My depression is entirely brain chemistry, I have a loving family, great friends and nothing truly traumatic, but it is almost worse because of it. Most people who survive suicide feel better, they realise that all their problems are fixable and life can move in. Mine is not.

I also did not want to have to explain to the nurse, the principal, my parents etc. about the awful things (or lack of things sometimes) that I felt. So I said nothing and continued moving through my life. School, homework, sleep. I was very mechanical for many years. I never attempted again but I certainly thought about it, sometimes daily. When I was younger, I was dissuaded by the idea that I would just fail again, but as I aged I needed soemthing more to hold on to. At this point I did not want to die, but a part of me was actively self-destructive. [BK][BK]Late in high school I hit a turning point. I do not remember exactly what happened but it involved something to do with studying existentialism. A good friend of mine had said something to about living life to its fullest, to which I internally scoffed. But then, I started thinking, although my life was worthless to me, perhaps it could be worth something to someone else. So I started volunteering, I started helping people whenever I could. Even if my life was empty, I might as well make other people''s lives better right? Because I had already failed once to die, so while I was still stuck here, I might as well be useful. [BK][BK]My volunteering led me to work with teenagers, some dealing with the same issues I had. I find it easy to connect with them sometimes, because the thoughts they have are the same ones I endure. I have also discovered something else. Regardless of how awful my thoughts are (I still think about killing myself daily), I know that I am winning my battle because I would NEVER do that to the teens I work with. I can rationalize away the reactions of my family and friends (they are strong, they would get through it) but I cannot rationalize betraying so many people who have confided in me over the years. And that keeps me going, every day, every night. When the back of my mind howls at me to end it, I know that I will not -because I am living for more than just me. I am a lifeline, I can help others, and killing myself would cause more destruction that I am willing to take responsibility for. [BK][BK]Which brings me to the crux of this post: To anyone who feels worthless or numb or has no reason to live, start looking inside and outside yourself for the one thing you can seize and hold on to for dear life.

Im first thought was disappointment to wake up and see that i was still alive. then came the sadness. my mom was sitting right beside my bed crying and had not left my side since i had arrived. 16 year old me tried overdosing on trazadone and i took about 10 or 17 pills so i woke up feeling REALLY really gross, my throat hurt and so did my stomach. then came the fear because i realized where i was about to go and i did not really want to be in the ward. i tried to lie my way out of going but they decided i was at risk to myself. kinda sucked. never again|drug
Wasn't really a thought, more like a feeling. I just felt completely defeated, exhausted, pathetic. I would tried to overdose, went to sleep, and woke up feeling sick and nauseous but ultimately alright. I just felt so tired, emotionally. I had tried so hard for so long to stop feeling the way I was feeling and now even my last effort, suicide, had failed. I just felt tired, more tired than I would ever felt in my life.|drug

oh man a thread I have an answer to. I took aprox 500 pills to try and end myself. The pills consisted of my antidepressants, allergy meds and a few other prescription i was on at the time. after taking them i fell asleep and then mid way through the night woke up and threw up some of the pills and then fell right back to sleep. After waking up again in the morning I though about why I was still alive as well as how shity I felt as the pills I took make me very  nauseous.  a few interesting notes after I went to the hospital they did not have room for me so I had to wait over 24 hours after I had taken the meds before I got admitted to the emergency room and then had to drink charcoal which is single handedly the worst thing I have ever had to consume. I ever ended up going to the emergency room and then left and came back because the wait was so long.|drug|alcohol
Not sure if this is exactly what you are asking for because my attempt was to jump in front of a train so there had not really been a way for me to survive but I will type down my thoughts after the train passed. [BK][BK]I felt confused at first, puzzled as to why I survived what happened, then I started to cry. First it was a cry of pain and misery because I realized what I had just tried to do, then of relief and joy because my best friend saved me at the last second and pulled me away. He made me realize at that moment that despite how shitty your life may be, given some time and work and everything can be much better. |vehicle|jump
Attempted school shooting. A boy brought a gun to school and held a class hostage until two other students tackled him and disarmed him.[BK]We got to see lots of different rumors fly around afterwards. The two boys were thought of as heroes in the town and another teacher bought them the fanciest class rings of there choice. When it started an assistant slipped out of the class became ambiguous whether she did it to abandon the kids to the shooter or to alert the police. Everyone had their own story of what they were doing at the time. My favorite was my friend's Archery teacher, realizing they could not hide in an open field during the lockdown, sent them with there bows and arrows to hide in the hills and bushes.|gun
I had tried to OD and slit wrists at the same time.  I ended up panicking because I was high and out of it and bleeding and my roommate noticed and called 911.

Tl:dr My very first conscious thought was that I could not even succeed at killing myself. How useless and stupid was I that I could not do anything without fucking it up. [BK][BK]I was depressed and failing out of school. My father was deployed to Bosnia and was my only real support, only I was not even sure if he was ever coming home. My mom was in the middle of a debilitating addiction and undiagnosed mental illness. She could not help herself let alone 3 children.[BK][BK] I was 13, my brother was 11 and my sister was 18months. My mom had moved us off base and away from all family and support because 'they are trying to turn everyone against us'. At least according to my mom. [BK][BK]A week after we moved mom started disappearing. She could be gone anywhere from 12 hours to 5 days. There was no way of knowing when, if or in what kind of state she would come home. We had no support, we knew no one and I did what I had to. I stopped going to school to take care of the baby and I walked to the food bank every 2 days with a wagon to get some food. My mom eventually came back but was mostly catatonic; I was used to it, she would realize she fucked up then spiral into a deep depression and forget we existed. She might as well have stayed gone.[BK][BK]At 13 I was aware that my life was probably not going to get much better than this. I loved my little sister and I tolerated my annoying brother, but to them I was an essential need. I fed them, tucked them in at night, tried to get my brother to the bus on time, went to the food bank, shoplifted the items I could not find at the food bank etc. My life sucked. [BK][BK]The week I decided I would had enough was 8 months after we had moved to this 'new beginning'. The school had called and I answered, they wanted to set up a parent teacher meeting about my brother because at 11 he had shown up to school drunk and high. We set it up and I said my mom would be there. I knew she would not she was not even home. I decided I would go instead; the teacher did not take it well. She did not for one second consider that I was trying to do the right thing for my brother, she assumed it was a prank/joke. Trying to convince the teachers that I was my mom say I left crying and they were calling my mom (good luck). [BK][BK]I went home feeling defeated and completely useless. I knew I was basically done with school. The teachers were figuring out slowly that something was wrong and I knew from stories my mom had told; my innocent baby sister was going to get taken away and my brother would be thrown in the system and if I was lucky I would not go to jail for stealing. I was 13 and really did not have any reason to believe otherwise. I was scared and could feel my world crumbling. [BK][BK]If I could have kept my brother out of trouble, if I could have helped my mom, maybe if I would been smarter.. all the questions of a 13 year old way way over her head. I decided that I was the problem and I really did not want to go to jail. Everything was going to change, i miggt never see my family again. I was desperate. So i decided my best plan was to end my life on my terms. [BK][BK]I got all of mom's crazy pills from before dad left and some crazy new ones from the last few weeks, I grabbed a pop from the 711 across the street and downed as many pills as I could. My brother called 911 when he got home. It was grotesque, I was almost dead surrounded by vomit, my eyes were completely red from the vomiting and I was barely weazing. (I have no recollection of any of this). [BK][BK]I woke up in the hospital was a cps worker and no one else. I had never once considered surviving and now here I was, I had ruined my family.

"I have bit long story behind my suicide attempts. There were 3 in total, but i tell you from first of them. I know, my english might be bit sluggish... but, i just want to share this story of mine. To help all who struggles with same feelings i had, (and traumas i cannot still get rid of)[BK][BK]I was only 12 and middle of may. Spring was coming and darkness of winter passed by. At that point, i was bullied for 3 years. Lived in fear of people coming to hurt me and making fun of my clothing, appearance or my attitude to nature. I like nature, and always escaped into woods and climbed tree so high so bad people i hated could not to climb.[BK]One day, like eny other day. It started. I do not know the real reason they pick me. but several months later i was mentally so broken, that i wanted to just pass by. Unnoticed and become part of shadows.[BK]This is how they killed my bright and smiley me: I got trapped by this one group. They made circle around me so i cannot escape. They pushed me back in middle of circle if i tried. They started to poke me with names: 'Treehugger'"", and many more rude and humiliating ones. I shouted help and cried. Then i saw through my teary eyes the first punch. These people never let me go before hurting. Leaders '""right hand'"" started it. He punched me in shoulder (i was able to dodge it somehow, or otherwise it would be head) Then circle of bad, shouting ppl started to rage. I leave rest to your imagination to cover, I am still too broken to tell it in actual words. This kind of bullying i was trapped in 3 years.[BK][BK]I felt miserable. I wanted my abuse to stop. I told my parents about that but they thought i was exaggerating the problem and they did not believe it entirely. Only idea i came up with was killing myself, since pain mental and physical i felt was far more greater than killing myself would cause.[BK]So, i jumped of bridge, in water, (from 34m high) and i wanted to drown to death. I know, I had pretty decent percent to survive, and so i did. Water did hit me unconscious.[BK][BK]I woke up in one shore of that river. I was wet, my head was pounding, i puked water out of my lungs and stomach and i was alive. I floated almost 1km from bridge i jumped off.

I dried my cloths in early springs sun. Walked home, and went to shower. Put new clothes on and cried in my bed for rest of day until i fell asleep. In morning my lungs hurt, i was sick since i caught cold and i did''t speak a word what i had done. I was so shocked i could not talk in month. This was the point my parents really realized all i said was truth. I was sent to psychologist and my parents tried to make me talk again, to tell names of bad ppl. I never even realized they had names. So, i remained silent.[BK][BK]And i still fear them. Now, they are just nightmares. But they do not go away. Currently I am 19. And still.

"Ouch. My belt broke and I fell out of the tree.[BK][BK]***Edited for the whole story when I returned from Chic-Fila[BK][BK]It started off as a stupid move on my part over a pointless argument with my Mother. I have a history of Manic Depression and I had thought about suicide a lot. I never went all out before, though. I ran outside and climbed a tree, wrapped my belt around my neck/tree, and pushed off from the branch. The belt broke after a few seconds and I fell to the ground. That is when I thought ouch and screw this, I am going to eat a bottle of generic Advil. I was then informed by my Mother that the pills would not really hurt me, except for probable my liver. I then called my Friend to come get me, so we could drive around or go see his Brother. His Brother also had a history of trying to kill himself and I thought that maybe talking to someone else who suffered from depression would help. My Friend informed that his Father was home and we both did not really like being around him. We drove around for a few hours getting stoned and then the guilt hit me. I had to go home and apologize for my stupid actions before my Mother went to sleep. My Friend then tried to talk me into going to his house to say hi to his Brother, but conceded that we were all going job hunting in the morning, so we could meet up then. I got dropped off, apologized to my Mother, and then got paranoid about falling asleep with all the Advil in my belly. I finally passed out at around five. Now, I sleep like I am dead and usually nothing can wake me up. I actually have slept through two hurricanes. Well, around 6 my eyes opened and I saw the caller id lit up. I closed my eyes and re-opened them with the phone in my hand and next to my ear. 'What''s up?'"" I  asked and my friend says'"" My brother hung himself last night, can you come over?'""

I lived with them for a year and they basically lived with us for around ten years at that point. My friend was my Sister''s first real boyfriend! Well my Mother said let us go and we both jumped in different showers, took off driving, and made a fifteen minute trip in four minutes. We got to the front door and my Friend opened it and just lost it when he saw my Mother. I went looking for his Mom and she lost it when she saw me. The police were questioning the Father and the body was in the back yard under a blanket. My Mother went over to the cop and started chewing his ass over how he was treating my Friend''s Dad. She was threatened by arrest, but she would not back down. She won the argument and then called a Priest. I was in shock. This is my own A Christmas Carol. I could not put two and two together. I was watching a horrible play entitled '"" How to destroy a Family aka You almost did this to yours'"". I walked out front and around to the driveway. I saw the paramedics on the driveway waiting on the cops to finish up so they could take the body away. I light up a cigarette and walked to the backyard to say good bye to my friend. I saw the familiar Vans poking out from the blood stained blanket underneath the basketball goal where I learned how to dunk. I lost it. What a waste. It all hit me how horrible this was and how if I had just gone over there last night it might have changed something. My Mother came outside and looked at me. Without a word we both knew what the other was thinking. I was so lucky that my belt broke and I spared my family from this horrible nightmare. [BK][BK]I went home and called my Father, who was well on his way to exiting our lives for better pastures, and he did not answer the phone instead choosing to draft me a letter. He gave me some actual parting wisdom. '""Suicide is the last selfish act of a selfish person, set to hurt a select group of people.'""

I can understand that sometimes it is overwhelming and it weighs so much that some people just cannot take it anymore, but seriously, think about your friends, family, hell even your acquaintances! The guilt and fallout from suicide is something that no one can ever forget.

Tried to OD on OTC medications during my freshman year of college. I did it in the morning and fell asleep, but kept waking up in tons of pain.

Apparantly I wrote a note (and a coherent one, at that) and told everyone goodbye.[BK][BK]I still have no idea what the hell happened, and everyone knows that I do not want to know."""|drug
I tried taking a bunch of painkillers when I was about 16. My parents had gone through an horrendous divorce, I was dating someone terrible for me, I was failing school, and had this crippling depression since I was nine. I had been addicted to prescription drugs for a while and I guess I either did not take enough or my tolerance was too high. I just slept and threw up a lot. Then when I sort of came to, I was still heavy under the effects of the pills and sort of attacked my mother (not my proudest moment). She grabbed my arm and I clawed her trying to get away from her. Ick.[BK][BK][BK]When I fully regained lucidity, I just cried a lot. I hated myself for it not working, but I also hated everything about who I was. I remember feeling like a disappointment to myself and how utterly defeated I felt when I realized I had to still be me.|drug
After slitting my wrists and blacking out I woke up in a hospital bed. Alone in the dark and restrained to the bed. The only thing I could think of how easy it was. A lot simpler than I figured it would have been. After that the only worries I had were about the process of getting things back to normal. It was not easy. Not at all.|cut|hang
"I remember thinking something along the lines of, 'This is not set up correctly.'"" Partial hanging ended up being more difficult than I had expected, so I was fairly reluctant in fear of it not working and my mother consequently finding me still alive.[BK][BK]I had been sitting on my bedroom floor beneath the doorknob, hardly able to breathe, to the sound of beautiful classical music playing on my radio. It took maybe ten minutes before I gave up, thought the phrase above, hid the rope, and went back to bed. It was 10AM. I was supposed to be at school."""|hang
Took a bunch of pills then went to sleep. My best friend knew I had been having a hard time and woke me up at 4 in the afternoon. My first conscious thought was that I was embarrassed that I had thrown up in my sleep, followed by realizing how hungry I was. We went to Subway afterwards.|drug
Almost 2 years ago I attempted to overdose, woke up in the hospital...I just got sick of the verbal and emotional abuse of my parents and I did not see any other way out at the time... When I woke up i felt even worse... I had lost my fiance... He broke up with me because he did not want to be with a crazy person... I am doing better now I moved out and have a job and am looking to go back to school.|drug
I was pretty hungover, covered in blood and wondered why my throat hurt so much.|bleed
That I was so much of a fuckup that I could not even kill myself properly. I tried to OD on pills but ended up puking them up after I had driven away from my house, and onto a nearby hill.|drug

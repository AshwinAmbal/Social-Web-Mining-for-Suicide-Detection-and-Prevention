Hey everyone,[BK][BK]This is just a friendly reminder that discussion of suicide can be really difficult for those who are going  through a tough time and may bring up some scary feelings.|12782
If you are feeling like you are not coping, please know that there are resources out there available to you.|12782
[BK][BK]There are [crisis services worldwide](https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/) that are trained to provide support.|12782
These centres are designed to give temporary relief from feelings that are overwhelming you and while they are unlikely to fix any underlying problems, can help you get through a tough hour/night/week.|12782
[BK][BK]Otherwise, if you feel like you may be suffering from a mental illness or your thoughts/feelings are making it hard to cope, I strongly recommend trying to find an appropriate professional in your area.|12782
Just as you would see a doctor when you are sick, you deserve to take care of your mental health.|12782
[BK][BK]Stay safe people.|12782
I started immediately crying because I thought everyone would hate me.|12782
Everyone was going to be angry at me now that they knew what I would done.|12782
[BK][BK]The doctor was kind enough to have me on no visitors for a while.|12782
Only doctors and nurses, who were all very very kind to me.|12782
I could not look most of them in the face when they came in.|12782
I felt embarrassed.|12782
Ashamed.|12782
Normal people want to live, right?|12782
The doctor, two therapists, and a nurse assured me that my family and friends would not hate me or be angry.|12782
They'd maybe be confused or a little sad, but they would be supportive.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]The saddest part?|12782
[BK][BK]I was right.|12782
They did all hate me.|12782
*all*.|12782
[BK]Did wonders for my depression, let me tell you!|12782
[BK]|12782
Maybe I should ask mom and dad for help if I cannot even get this right.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]I was 12.|12782
Well I had attempted to hang myself when I was 15.|12782
I have a birth defect (deformed legs) and just could not take the bullying anymore.|12782
So I got myself all strung up by a belt stuck in the door jam of my closet, stood up on a stool, and tried to get the courage to knock the stool over.|12782
[BK][BK]Then I accidentally knocked the stool over.|12782
[BK][BK]I hanged for about fifteen seconds, just long enough to make things start to go black.|12782
And then the cheap plastic belt I was using broke.|12782
"[BK][BK]I hit the ground and just yelled out loud 'OH FUCK'"" because 1."|12782
The belt broke and I was still here, and 2.|12782
Thank god the belt broke and I was still here.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: Thank you guys so much for your wonderful kind words and support.|12782
As for what happened to the people who bullied me, one is in jail and the other is up to be a CEO.|12782
No clue how that happened but oh well XD  [BK][BK]I have found something I am truly passionate about (comic books and animation) and things have been on a steady uphill climb.|12782
And to anyone currently struggling, PLEASE PM ME!|12782
Feel free to just rant or get something off your chest; I am no psychiatrist, but I *am* a very good listener.|12782
"Keep your chin up guys! """|12782
Bit late, but I tried hanging myself in my closet in the clothes rack.|12782
I used a dressing gown rope which ultimately broke.|12782
[BK][BK]When I regained consciousness I did not know where I was and my lamp light was very bright.|12782
I had drool running down my chin.|12782
When I got up it took me a minute or so to realise what had happened.|12782
I guess I was in shock as I sort of just put on a movie and went about the rest of my night like nothing happened.|12782
[BK][BK]It was during my psychologist appointment the next day the reality came crashing down on me and I broke down and was sent to the psychiatric ward[BK][BK]For a while I was so angry that I did not succeed and sometimes I still am.|12782
I am alot better now although I still battle with suicidal thoughts and severe depression.|12782
When I feel another bout coming on I choose little things to hang onto like the next episode of a tv show I like to come out or realising I need to read a book series.|12782
[BK][BK]|12782
Just never really saw the point of living as a kid.|12782
I always watched the news and read things that a kid probably should not have been reading.|12782
Agonizing over every horror in the world.|12782
I can remember being six or seven and reading articles on tensions in the middle east(like those are new!)|12782
then watching the news and hearing that we were minutes from nuclear war and just thinking, 'So, why?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I would lie in bed and spend hours trying to imagine what it would be like to be dead."|12782
To be nothing.|12782
It was scary at first but then it just seemed better.|12782
I had friends and was popular.|12782
I was college bound and gifted in academics and the arts but every night I would close my eyes and try to be dead.|12782
Hoping that if I could lock my mind in on what it was like it would welcome me.|12782
[BK][BK]Fast forward a few years and I had just lost a job I hated, felt like my parents and family hated me.|12782
I went to the beach one afternoon and decided it was just time to be done with it.|12782
I had a prescription for a powerful sleeping aid so the method was clean and easy.|12782
I came home, boxed everything up so no one would be inconvenienced by having to sift through my things, wrote a letter expressing my deep sense of hopelessness and apologizing to everyone for every small wrong I would committed, outlined a brief will, carefully folded the letter as to make sure it would fit perfectly into the envelope I had labeled **DNR**, and washed down the pills I had with whiskey.|12782
"[BK][BK]Woke up or rather regained any sense of consciousness eighteen or so hours later and sat there feeling like shit and screamed, '""Are you fucking kidding me?"|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I have no idea how I did not die and it still kind of pisses me off."|12782
I have not gained any sense of enlightenment or hope.|12782
I am not suicidal anymore and while I think about being dead often the periods between such thoughts are longer as I get older.|12782
[BK][BK]Even as I experience success in life and allow my creativity to come out more than I did that voice is still there:  *This is pointless.|12782
No one is going to remember.|12782
No one is going to care.|12782
Everyone is in transit and all things are fleeting.|12782
* it got easier to not listen after I unpacked those boxes and burned that envelope.|12782
[BK][BK]I talked to a therapist about it but I could see the look in her eyes and knew there were no answers.|12782
She would prescribe something that would not fix anything.|12782
It would just change the nature of my misery.|12782
[BK][BK]I have happy moments but they are always stained with the awareness of everything that is wrong, everyone who is in pain, and that in the end none of this really matters.|12782
I doubt I am less sad.|12782
"I think I have just gotten used to it."""|12782
“I instantly realized that everything in my life that I’d thought was unfixable was totally fixable—except for having just jumped.” - Ken Baldwin, Golden Gate Bridge.|12782
"'Fuck, This is embarrassing'""[BK][BK]I tried to kill myself on the 1st of February this year, I am currently staying in University halls, the way I tried to kill myself was just to down a bunch of alcohol."|12782
That was the first thought that popped into my head and I obviously was not thinking straight.|12782
I drank a full bottle of wine, three bottles of cider, two beers in the space of about 10 minutes.|12782
"I hoped that if I drank them fast enough (I am only 5'""2 and about 120 pounds.)"|12782
I would get alcohol poisoning.|12782
But alas I just got super drunk and emotionally messaged my boyfriend what I had done, went to the bathroom and smashed my head on the sink intentionally in the hopes of giving myself brain damage, then passed out in his room.|12782
I awoke to paramedics standing around me doing all sorts of tests.|12782
(Blood pressure, sugar levels etc etc.)|12782
They asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital and I said no, they could not force me and since I was not in any actual danger they had to leave.|12782
"[BK][BK]It was embarrassing for me because I am a very awkward person and quite a lot of people in the halls had seen this commotion and wondered what was going on, two people who were not my boyfriend actually saw me passed out on the bed."""|12782
It was less of a conscious attempt, but once I took about 20 or so sleeping pills and a few benadrylls.|12782
I wound up starting to hallucinate extremely vividly to the point I could not differentiate reality from the hallucinations.|12782
I was tripping the fuck out, at one point trying to make myself throw up cause I began to worry.|12782
Eventually I passed out.|12782
"Woke up the next morning... [BK] [BK]'Wow I feel well rested as fuck'"""""|12782
No throwaway please excuse Grammer and format I am just putting this out there.|12782
I am just going to type it out.|12782
I deal with ptsd and depression at the time I was dealing with my issues that I hid after coming home from over seas my divorce and I was getting close to losing my apartment I got drunk as hell got in a fight with my then girlfriend I racked my shotgun with my girl in the room and her daughter in the room next to us and pulled the trigger.|12782
The shell was sitting on the floor and the shotgun did not discharge.|12782
I was put in hand cuffs and had the police surrounding me with weapons drawn.|12782
I tried to fight but gave up.|12782
I was loaded in to an ambulance and taken to the hospital.|12782
The sergeant walked in to my room and said you are a lucky son of a bitch and showed me the shell that should have killed me.|12782
I spent a week in the psychological ward.|12782
The things I saw there were worse then iraq.|12782
I saw people shit the last selves and use it like make up.|12782
My first thought when the fog cleared was I should have died and the barrel of that shotgun still looked oddly tasty.|12782
Today I  am not doing the best but I want to live.|12782
Mental heath is no joke and we need to look at it a lot better.|12782
If any one is interested in will reformat and clean this up in the am other wise this will just get burried In the reddit pit of comments [BK][BK]Edit.|12782
[BK]Thank you to all of you for your comments really can feel the love.|12782
I did have a few tears from all of you.|12782
Good thing I am cutting onions at my part time job[BK][BK]I still have my bad days but have not had suicidal thoughts in a cupple of years.|12782
[BK][BK]To any one else who know a vet the 22 a day is real.|12782
If they are on facebook tag them to battle in distress.|12782
They are trained and usually help with in minuets.|12782
Also have them look up warrior pointe.|12782
It is a group of vets that do get together and also offer assistance with va claims.|12782
Any vet out there feel free to pm me if you are ever having a problem[BK][BK]Again thank you all|12782
Immense guilt.|12782
[BK][BK]I was 13.|12782
I would been raped by a man.|12782
I could not get my head right.|12782
I overdosed on everything I could find and went to bed to die.|12782
My next memory is laying in bed on the hospital ward with my dad next to the bed.|12782
He looked at me and asked: 'this was not because of me was it?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I will never forget the guilt I felt in that moment."|12782
He''d been sat there all night scared shitless that his son might die and - wrongly - that he might somehow be the cause of it.|12782
He''s not what you had call an emotional man; he is gruff, pragmatic, conservative.|12782
Seeing the tears in his eyes and hearing his voice crack... it will stay with me.|12782
[BK][BK]20 more years later, that guilt is what stops going through with it now.|12782
I stand at the platform edge waiting for the tube train to roll in, or walking over Waterloo bridge on my way home, and I wish I had it in me to jump.|12782
I even went to Canada to try, hoping that the distance would somehow ameliorate the memory.|12782
But I feel such guilt ... for my family and friends... who, despite whatever note I might leave, would be caused immense grief.|12782
[BK][BK]Don''t do it kids.|12782
"If you feel like you cannot go on, talk to someone."""|12782
"'This is either hell, or the worst hangover ever'"" after a ton of under the counter sleeping meds with two bottles of whiskey."|12782
Woke up on the ground after apparently locking my room.|12782
I could feel how dry my eyes were from the crying.|12782
"[BK][BK]I checked myself in the mirror and my only reaction was '""please, just tell me it is over'"" and then I burst out in barely dry heaving tears."|12782
[BK][BK]As soon as that was done I went back to my room and double checked.|12782
Yep, two bottles of cheap whiskey, no puke, all the meds taken, what had gone wrong?!|12782
[BK][BK]Charge up my phone, see that it is been a whole day and a half of me being passed out, my housemates (busy with studies so not in the house) asking whether I want to join them for a pint.|12782
[BK][BK]Definite no and up to this day I have yet to mention this all new low I reached to anybody.|12782
It was despicable.|12782
Driven by hatred, scorn, alcoholism, egoism and all the vile things that a human at the bare age of 20 can acquire.|12782
"[BK][BK]And then it hit me, with an extremely slow delay, '""Fuck this, if everything can fuck me over viciously in completely undeserved ways, I can do better on its own terms by proving to be the victor.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]And that is exactly what I strive for nowadays, proving that there is a point to it.|12782
"Even though I still despise every second of my life, I found meaning in seeing my close friends smile, having deep and meaningful conversations, struggling to become better not for me, but for the people who care about me, because that is what happiness proved to be for me in the end. """|12782
After the click of the pistol, I sat there in a state of shock.|12782
I do not know what really happened.|12782
I swear I saw an angel floating in front of me, and that is why the gun misfired.|12782
My first conscious thought was I needed help.|12782
[BK][BK]The chaos of war while I was in Iraq, the ungodly vivid memories of the smell of rot and the way the skin of the water logged bodies slopped off in my hand while I was deployed to New Orleans for Katrina; and every life threatening mission I was on was going to kill me if I did not get help.|12782
[BK][BK]If you are facing the temptation of suicide I beg you to reach out to someone.|12782
If you are a veteran there are amazing resources for you.|12782
There is:[BK]https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/ or 18002738255 then press 1[BK]Http://www.woundedwarriorproject.org or Call the Resource Center at 888.WWP.ALUM (997.2586)[BK][BK]Also I help veterans around me with claims and letters to congressional leaders to get claims moving.|12782
Whatever I can do to help do not hesitate to message me.|12782
Over 22 veterans a day are lost to suicide.|12782
Don't be one of them.|12782
I got your six.|12782
[BK]|12782
I have been suicidal since I was little tiny.|12782
Common events like riding home from church would have me looking wistfully at the door handle, thinking how easy it would be to slip out onto the highway.|12782
[BK][BK]I only acted on it after a situation went from physically abusive to emotionally ridiculous (I was 18, and my much larger brother unexpectedly turned and started wailing on me, pinning me down, repeatedly punching me in the face.|12782
The part that really hurt was my mom walked down after hearing me screaming, saw puddles of blood, and did not stand up for me.|12782
Even though my brother had his own place a couple hours away, he stayed at home, just watching T.V.|12782
with the family like it was a normal evening.)|12782
[BK][BK]Back to the topic, I felt so overwhelmed that I created a concoction that obviously failed.|12782
[BK][BK]I never told them.|12782
I decided to pack my things and move in with my boyfriend (who was a piece of shit).|12782
We lived together for almost a year before I could no longer stand his drug dealing, and inability to pay rent.|12782
I moved back home where I was treated like the prodigal son, because to the outside world I had simply shacked up with my loser boyfriend.|12782
[BK][BK]I have never told anyone the full story.|12782
Kind of embarrassing.|12782
"Kind of an 'impostor syndrom'"" thing going on."|12782
[BK][BK]I am married with two kids, and I have not had a suicidal thought in about five years.|12782
I guess because I have been busy doing life.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway, thanks for the prompt...|12782
I guess a psych would probably tell me this is emotionally healing?|12782
"[BK][BK]"""|12782
"'I guess if I cannot do it suddenly I will just have to kill myself slowly.'"""|12782
[BK]I had just taken 45-60 benadryl (not sure how big the bottle was, but it was the whole thing) and did not expect to wake up.|12782
I have done a lot of drugs, but nothing feels stranger than ODing on benadryl.|12782
The idea of quantum suicide is what really kept me from trying again.|12782
If there is always a version of myself that survives the attempt, and that is the one I experience every time, then there really is no point in trying to kill myself.|12782
I am gonna die when I die and there is nothing I can do to make it happen any faster.|12782
Except smoke cigarettes and do as many drugs as possible.|12782
After this attempt, that is exactly what I did.|12782
[BK]Then I tried LSD and life was pretty cool again.|12782
For a while.|12782
[BK][BK]I have been fighting the urge to kill myself for over a decade and I am pretty sure I always will.|12782
Even when things are nice it always feels like things would be easier to just be dead.|12782
[BK][BK]I hope you all find happiness, or at least a way to cope.|12782
Making everything a joke helps me cope.|12782
"I will keep fighting the good fight, whether I want to or not. """|12782
I had just been told via public Facebook post that my ex, who raped me, was HIV+.|12782
It was snowing that day, and I was too early to get into work, so I thought I would treat myself to a nice, hot breakfast nearby.|12782
After ordering, my phone buzzed.|12782
I was that person eating alone in a crowded restaurant who burst out into tears out of fear, confusion, frustration.|12782
I decided to rush to work.|12782
[BK][BK]The bus depot is the last road I needed to cross to get there.|12782
There was a bus coming.|12782
"I thought, it is snowy, I might as well 'slip'"" and end this."|12782
[BK][BK]Miraculously, the bus was able to stop quickly even on the slick pavement.|12782
The bus driver rushed out and helped me up, saying that I was lucky to be alive.|12782
[BK][BK]But my only thought was that I was not.|12782
They were lucky to not have to witness that; I could have ruined that bus driver''s life, and the lives of the other passengers.|12782
Sure, it would have been a mistake in their minds.|12782
[BK][BK]Then I thought about what would happen if it did not kill me.|12782
I could be paralyzed, brain dead, or comatose.|12782
I could have made my life worse.|12782
[BK][BK]I finished work that day, and went to get tested.|12782
Over a year later, and my results are still negative; I do not have HIV.|12782
I still struggle with the events that led up to the scare.|12782
I have since lost two people to suicide; a coworker''s daughter who was brought into work with us several times, and my second boyfriend.|12782
The fact that I opened myself up to dating again after the first experience, only to lose my closest friend two days after he had the courage to ask me out, was devastating.|12782
But the pain I still carry with me to this very moment is keeping me here.|12782
I cannot do that to anyone, strangers or family.|12782
And I am too afraid I will mess it up and live.|12782
It''s bad either way.|12782
"When you are not sure whether to call your result a '""success'"" or a '""failure,'"" maybe it is not worth doing at all."""|12782
I first read this as survivors of Reddit...|12782
I am a diabetic.|12782
I can remember deciding to use my insulin to go.|12782
Figured that passing out and dying of a seizure due to hypoglycemia would be a quick and easy way to go.|12782
[BK][BK]So I give myself the biggest dose that I could at one time, 60 units of fast acting insulin (it usually takes care of around 600g of carbs) and instantly regret it, so I run to the corner store across the street and get like 4 liters of sodas, and assorted chocolate bars, and dial for a Chinese delivery that arrived about 20 mins later.|12782
I got an odd look from the delivery guy as I start eating the chow mein right in front of him.|12782
[BK][BK] The entire episode lasted an hour before my blood sugars start to level out.|12782
I have never had to fight for my life before that, and it was pretty terrifying.|12782
But I totally have a new appreciation for food now, because it literally saved my life.|12782
[BK][BK] I cried for a while, prayed.|12782
"As far as what my first thoughts were after I injected myself was probably 'omygod, what have I done!'"""|12782
And just ran out of my house.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: some words and punctuation[BK]Edit: thank you everyone for your gold support and love!|12782
I really appreciate all of your kind words.|12782
"It may be a bit hard or embarrassing to talk about it, but if you ever need anything, or want to talk, please PM me."""|12782
'All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy.|12782
That''s how far the world is from where I am.|12782
Just one bad day.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]This was the spring of 2012, I had broken up with my girlfriend and few weeks earlier, my grades were slipping, I was living with two other people who I did not relate with, and I just felt alone."|12782
[BK][BK]I had been out to the bars, and even being around so many people, I felt even more lonely.|12782
As I pulled my car into the garage, I closed the garage door without turning the car off.|12782
I just sat there with the car running.|12782
My first thought was, we will I am here, and if I do nothing then it will all be over.|12782
Then it set in what I was actually doing.|12782
[BK][BK]And I laughed, I laughed harder than I had in months, I realized how stupid and foolish I was being.|12782
How weak and stupid I was.|12782
I  laughed and cursed at myself for doing the one thing I told myself was unforgivable.|12782
At that point 4 of my friends had killed themselves, and I would never do it to my friends and family.|12782
[BK][BK]I shut my car off, went inside and went to bed.|12782
The next day, I moved out of the apartment, I applied and was accepted to study abroad, and even though it took some time, I am graduating this spring and moving forward to my life.|12782
"[BK][BK]Going back to my the quote, I had two paths before me, I had my one bad day, and instead of giving into the insanity, I came out just a bit more sane."""|12782
Back in summer, I tried to do it with the car.|12782
I drove down a major road which ends in a roundabout.|12782
I pressed the gas till I was going 150 (km/h) then pulled the steering as hard as I could.|12782
I closed my eyes when I did it, and did it when I was entering the roundabout...|12782
It was night, so there were no other cars.|12782
[BK][BK]The fucking thing did not flip.|12782
It spun around and almost slammed into the fence.|12782
The first thing I remember, was the terror.|12782
Once I yanked the wheel I was terrified it was really happening, and when the screeching stopped I looked up, and it was as though in the aftermath of a cataclysm.|12782
I saw the smoke, the tire tracks, the stars above (cabrio banger), realized I was still alive, and could not begin to understand how was that possible.|12782
I stayed in a trance like state, until my senses returned to normal, still hearing the music playing.|12782
Eventually, some other people drove in the roundabout and were honking at me since I looked as though I would thrown the car about, which made me snap out of the trance.|12782
"[BK][BK]'You could have pressed the gas harder'"" was the first thought, followed by guilt over thinking, I would just left my friend''s house."|12782
How would it have been for them, to get a call in the morning that I died in a car crash just as I was leaving their house?|12782
How would it have been for my parents to hear that I killed myself in a foreign country?|12782
[BK][BK] The guilt almost made me throw up, but it also forced me to realize that I have a hell of a lot to lose if I go through with that again, and that death is the one thing that cannot be taken back.|12782
I still do not know how is it possible to be still alive.|12782
How did I make it without a scratch; but in them 3 seconds when I was expecting to go head first with 2 tonnes of metal on top of me, the fear of losing my life was greater than the wish to die.|12782
"Never tried it since, and although I had thoughts after that moment, and impulses, I never took them seriously ever again, having known that fear and guilt."""|12782
I swallowed two full bottles of seroquel, went to sleep, and woke up in the ICU .|12782
My mom had a weird urge to check on me in the middle of the night and found me unconcious and hardly breathing.|12782
"I opened my eyes and saw her and she said 'how could you do this to me'"" and i remember shutting my wyes really tight and hottest sadest tear rolled down my face and i thought the same thing."|12782
I was crushed that I was still alive.|12782
[BK][BK]I can still remember that pain over the pain of giving birth to my daughter.|12782
Who is now the reason i live and thrive today.|12782
She makes every second of my life worth it.|12782
"Everything is for her. """|12782
Posted my story in a similar thread a while ago, my first thought though was that I wanted to watch some Star Wars, so I cleaned myself up and went to it.|12782
Story is as follows:[BK][BK]My plan was to take a bunch of my parent's old hydrocodones and drink Southern Comfort until I passed out.|12782
Call it cowardice or whatever you will, but as young and as dumb as I was I started drinking before I took the pills.|12782
About half way down the bottle I choked down 8 tabs and chugged as much as I could.|12782
[BK][BK]To make a long story short, I blacked out and at some point barfed up the pills.|12782
Woke up slumped against a wall at 4:30 am on Sunday, February 21, 2010.|12782
[BK][BK]To this day I live my life as if I were supposed to already be dead.|12782
To me each day is a gift, and I choose to take each gift as an earnest sign that I have something to do on this Earth.|12782
I do not consider myself to be the same person that chose to take his life that Saturday night.|12782
When my eyes opened to the black basement of my house I knew that I had changed.|12782
[BK][BK]That said.|12782
You must pay attention to those around you whom you hold dear.|12782
If you suspect someone is contemplating suicide do not leave them in the dark.|12782
And please, if you are considering suicide, do not attempt.|12782
I cannot stress this enough.|12782
I beg of you to please seek help.|12782
I decided to hang myself with an extension cord in the rafters of my garage.|12782
I decided to do a quick test run to make sure the beam would hold before saying my goodbyes to my family.|12782
During the test run, I slipped off my chair and actually hung myself.|12782
The panic I felt during those few moments I was dangling was all it took to convince myself I should live.|12782
I needed desperately to tell my mother I loved her before I went.|12782
My father too.|12782
I could only think of getting out of it, so I could give them their well deserved goodbyes, and let them know how much I loved them.|12782
When I luckily managed to get my footing back on the chair, I realized I was not ready to go.|12782
I had so much love left in me.|12782
I felt like it gave me a second chance to realize I did not want to go through with it.|12782
I am doing well now.|12782
I have two beautiful girls, and a man who would give me the moon.|12782
I am happy I had a botched run, because I am sure I would not have realized how i really felt if I got to text my final goodbyes.|12782
[BK][BK]EDIT: Wow guys.|12782
I was really unsure about sharing this, to be completely honest, and nearly deleted it still after posting.|12782
This morning I woke up to so much compassion, and so many kind words, I am awestruck.|12782
People are awesome.|12782
You guys are awesome.|12782
Thank you so much for being the sort of people who give others hope and inspiration.|12782
What an amazing community.|12782
Really.|12782
Not so much a thought, more the realization that my mother was not upset because I had just tried to kill myself but was angry because the rope had dug deeply into the ceiling rafter and ruined the paint before it snapped.|12782
Posted this before but I will go again.|12782
"[BK]My first actual conscious thought was 'Wow, I am so weak I cannot even kill myself.'"""|12782
"A few moments later my thoughts were '""I am so strong, I cannot even kill myself.'"""|12782
Shit changed my life.|12782
"Started viewing the world down the lines of '""What does not kill me only makes me stronger.'"""|12782
"now I push myself to my limits and try things that I am afraid of. """|12782
It's actually a funny story.|12782
I hung myself.|12782
But the rope broke after I would passed out.|12782
I came-to on the floor.|12782
I sat up and felt something wet on the back of my scalp.|12782
It was blood.|12782
I would hit my head on the corner of a dresser.|12782
There was a nice pool of blood forming.|12782
I freaked out and called 911 because I would split my scalp open.|12782
Here I was, ready to die, and now I was scared that I was going to bleed to death.|12782
I will say, there was a young male medic that was with the group that showed up.|12782
He walked into the room and came back out white as a sheet.|12782
He did not like seeing the broken rope hanging from the beam.|12782
It really freaked him out.|12782
So I made up my mind to never attempt suicide.|12782
If a complete stranger reacted like that, I could only imagine how the person would feel who found me.|12782
I just could not do that to anyone ever again.|12782
As for the split scalp, I received   fourteen stitches.|12782
Serves me right.|12782
"'Should have used a better rope, I need a reason to explain my neck'"""""|12782
I took a huge aspirin overdose, about 200 pills, and then got into bed and waited to fall asleep.|12782
However, sleep did not come.|12782
Hours passed, I developed stomach pains and the pains got worse.|12782
I became sweaty and agitated and tossed and turned.|12782
After several hours, I realised I was not going to fall asleep.|12782
I realised I would be awake while dying, and it might take days.|12782
The pain was already so bad that I realised I could not take that.|12782
I had no choice but to go and wake my mother up and tell her what I would done.|12782
I stood outside her bedroom door for ages, trying to summon up the courage to go in and tell her what I would done.|12782
It was just awful.|12782
We went to the hospital, and I was taken through immediately.|12782
It was too late to pump my stomach, I had to be put on a drip and given activated charcoal to drink instead.|12782
But the aspirin had really taken hold and I became terribly confused and spent the next few days having audio and visual hallucinations, and often not being sure where I was or what was going on.|12782
When I came back to reality, I think my first conscious thought was hurt and dismay that everybody - medical staff, friends and family - were being so unsympathetic and downright nasty to me because of what I would done.|12782
I was given no psychiatric help, just discharged after my physical ailments had been seen to.|12782
I was 17 years old.|12782
I am 32 now and despite repeated requests, still have not received any psychiatric help.|12782
I would still commit suicide now if I could find a sure-fire way of doing it.|12782
this happened in the UK if anyone is wondering.|12782
The NHS is fucking useless for dealing with this sort of thing, and my family are totally unsupportive.|12782
First thought three months ago when I was discovered and involuntarily admitted to hospital: “Fuck off.|12782
I don’t want your help.|12782
I just want to die.|12782
I don’t want to be at a hospital, I want to be dead.”[BK]First thought when the rope snapped a month ago: “All that pain to my neck for nothing.|12782
How the hell did that slip?|12782
I’ll leave it up and try again tomorrow.” [BK]No feelings of regret, shame, or guilt here folks; just incomprehensible anger that I still didn’t/still haven’t succeeded.|12782
The first time I was rather young, so when I cut myself and did not bleed, I freaked out and decided ''the universe'' was not going to let me kill myself.|12782
"Turns out, you can totally cut yourself and not bleed for a variety of reasons; but I thought I had tried to cheat some divine plan and not bleeding out was the cosmos saying 'nice try, but not today'""."|12782
[BK][BK]The second time was a few years later with a handful of pills.|12782
I woke up two days later.|12782
I was super groggy and dehydrated, took me a few minutes to figure out my muscles again to stand.|12782
"First thought after I stood up and realized it was a completely different time of day was definitely '""Well..."|12782
"fuck.'"""|12782
And then, of course, remembering the first time, and this time thinking that the universe was rather cruel for not letting me die, again.|12782
[BK][BK]I have made plans twice since.|12782
A few years ago when I had been abandoned by my father and abused by his most recent girlfriend, I had decided on a method and had begun writing final goodbye letters.|12782
After sending out the first one, my grandparents called me up and ''talked me off the ledge''.|12782
I had a deep, heavy, ugly cry.|12782
I could not do it, knowing someone actually cared about me.|12782
[BK][BK]Last month, I started planning again.|12782
Things have been hard.|12782
This is all very upsetting for my shrink, who has not been much help.|12782
She pleaded with me not to go through with it, so...|12782
I have been self medicating pretty hard on top of my anti-depressants.|12782
[BK][BK]It keeps the demons at bay.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: Well this got much, much bigger than anticipated.|12782
I had a good cry over all the incredibly positive feedback.|12782
I do not really have it in me to give meaningful replies to everyone, but thank you.|12782
[BK][BK]My last session with my current shrink is tomorrow, but I do not have anything else lined up yet.|12782
Mental health care is not cheap, even in some nationalized systems, and living in the US... well, if you cannot afford to be healthy, you are not.|12782
[BK][BK]I am not actively planning to kill myself anymore.|12782
Like I said, I have just.. stepped up the drugs.|12782
Weed is legal in this state, but I still feel like a useless addict because it is one of the only things that can make me immune to despair for a few hours.|12782
[BK][BK]I cannot afford school anymore, and I have accepted that, once more sweeping my broken dreams into the box of things best not dwelt upon.|12782
I am just going to find a job I can get by on, and hopefully get a cat; and maybe having something to love and love me back will help fill the void a bit.|12782
"[BK][BK]Thank you all for your rare kindness."""|12782
The first thing I remember is being in the  ambulance with them forcing me to drink something disgusting.|12782
[BK][BK]Next thing I remember is laying in a room on a table or something begging the nurses to just let me die.|12782
I kept saying 'please let me die, why will not you let me die.|12782
"Everyone would be so much happier if you just let me die.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]Then I was in a room in the cardiac Ward with an aide who was not allowed to leave my side.|12782
[BK][BK]It was a horrible experience, they were overly full in the psych ward.|12782
I saw a psych doctor once and they released me within 48 hours.|12782
I spent the next four years in deep depression until I got tired of them experimenting with meds and feeling like I wanted to die.|12782
I finally broke down and told my mom that I have wanted to die for years and that this weekend either I am killing myself or something is happening to fix it.|12782
[BK][BK]She took me into my urgent care and I talked to this sweet older grandfatherly doctor.|12782
He very kindly explained that I needed more help than he could give me.|12782
That I needed to go home and pack a bag for a week away.|12782
He was going to call the hospital and tell them that I would be there within an hour and a half.|12782
[BK][BK]Going home and telling my husband and children that I was going away for at least a week was the second hardest thing I have ever done.|12782
[BK][BK]When we got to the hospital they were full, luckily I WANTED help so they were able to send me to the voluntary Ward at the UW.|12782
I will be forever grateful to them.|12782
Once I got there, I felt so much better.|12782
The option of suicide was off the table and they were going to help me.|12782
"[BK][BK]I still struggle with major depressive disorder every day but I have not thought that I wanted to die for years now."""|12782
When I was 16 I tried to slit my wrist.|12782
(I went the correct direction and everything) I was just numb.|12782
I tried to hide it from my parents by wearing a black hoodie but that did not work.|12782
My mom (who is an RN) saw it, wrapped it up and rushed me to the E.R...They patched me up and the next day I woke up in the psych ward.|12782
"My first thought was 'fuck that hurt, gotta do it again?!'"""|12782
I was kept in the ward for 1 week.|12782
"They gave me Haldol which basically turned me into a zombie, after a week of taking the med, I started to have a terrible reaction where I could not control some of muscles and all I could think was '""I am not willing to try this again, fail , and end up in another institution. '"""|12782
still struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts every day, 10 years later.|12782
"Having a family helps, but it is still tough. """|12782
That feeling of failure that some other folks have described is so real.|12782
I remember feeling really angry at myself, and disappointed, and like all that effort had not been worth it.|12782
I was also really concerned about my relationship with my mom, and whether it would ever be repaired.|12782
[BK][BK]Happy to say, ten years on, that my relationship with my mom is excellent.|12782
I cannot say, however, that I do not wish I had succeeded.|12782
"Even though my life is better than it was, my brain has lingered in a 'thoughts but no plan'"" state this whole time."|12782
A therapist once called me a suicide opportunist, and it felt like the most real characterization of my mental state I would ever heard.|12782
"Her feeling was that my '""no plan'"" was really that I would eventually seize an opportunity (bridge, etc), very spontaneously and with literally no warning."|12782
[BK][BK]I do not know.|12782
Things are better and I am the same.|12782
"Thank you everyone, for sharing your stories. """|12782
I was with the boyfriend.|12782
He fell asleep, I wanted to forever.|12782
I remember nothing clearly after the ambien.|12782
But as soon as I came to, I have weird memory flashes.|12782
The boyfriend being in the drivers side of my car...|12782
The glaring lights of the first response.|12782
[BK]He tried to get me in the car, but my breathing slowed dramatically.|12782
He had to call 911.|12782
He saved my life.|12782
[BK]Those flashes haunt me, as I am sure they do him.|12782
For me, those memories force me to understand the pain and fear and panic he experienced.|12782
[BK][BK]EDIT: This was quite recent and I have had to drop from school and as a result have been crazy looking for work.|12782
I have actually been head hunted.|12782
Had an extremely promising interview today.|12782
I know it may not come through but just seeing that I am of that much value to be sought out is amazing.|12782
[BK][BK]EDIT: I got the job!|12782
Fantastic!|12782
Pretty much along the lines of 'Well shit.|12782
"I am not dead'""."|12782
And then spending the rest of the day real pissed off and in tons of pain.|12782
Except the last time I tried in February, I was relieved when I woke up.|12782
"Maybe that is a good sign but I still want to die in general."""|12782
I am not doing something right.|12782
I hope this does not get buried, but here it goes.|12782
Maybe no one will read this, but I hope someone does and it can help.|12782
[BK][BK]My first feeling was not relief, it was more anger and pain.|12782
I felt like a bigger failure than I already felt, and since I was handcuffed to a hospital bed and on my way to a psychiatric hospital, the tremendous weight of the process I had to now go through was overwhelming.|12782
I was in a locked facility for 17 days, and I lied to every doctor evaluating me the whole time.|12782
Told them I regretted what I did, that I wanted to live, that the incident seemed like it happened forever ago, blah blah blah.|12782
Just a steady stream of bullshit coming out of my mouth.|12782
The truth was I was playing for a quick release so I could go home and do the job properly.|12782
[BK][BK]I obviously did not.|12782
The way my mother cried when she visited me in the hospital has stopped me so far.|12782
Also, my best friend''s mother, whom I love like my own family, gave me the best advice I got during that time.|12782
"I was talking to her about what happened, and I was kind of beating around the bush explaining what happened, and she stopped me and just said 'own it'""."|12782
That''s made a huge difference.|12782
[BK][BK]So here''s my advice to you if you are reading this all the way at the bottom of some Reddit thread.|12782
If your life seems worthless and you hate yourself and you see no point in living, the hard fucking truth is you are right.|12782
I am not going to sit here and beg you to get help.|12782
You have a choice to make, so make it.|12782
But remember that killing yourself has consequences for your family, friends, community.|12782
And also this:  just because your life does not matter does not mean it is automatically better to be dead.|12782
Own who you are.|12782
"To quote a certain half-man, '""never forget what you are."|12782
"Wear it like armor, and it can never be used against you'"""""|12782
I attempted suicide about 3 years ago, took 190 10mg ambien and 100 50mg tramadol to try an overdose.|12782
My dad found my body colapsed on the floor with major scrapes on my legs.|12782
He called 911 when he found me, and I very faintly remember being taken out if the ambulance (this was a Wednesday evening) and I did not fully wake up until late Sunday night.|12782
At first I tried to tell my family it was just a really heavy night of drinking etc etc, but I eventually broke down and told them everything while we were in the hospital.|12782
I do not really remember much about those few days I was in a coma, I 100 percent swear I saw 2 people sitting next to me, and talking to me at one point, but all of my family and the doctors say there was nobody there.|12782
I did not believe them, so they showed me the security footage of the time I swear 2 people were there, and on the screen there was nobody, it was a very surreal though (for those wondering yes I do believe in God, but that is not about this post).|12782
After I told them all what happened, and was finally released from the hospital I moved back to my home town.|12782
Now currently, I am finishing a computer science degree at my local community college, got promoted to management at my local Best Buy store, and just recently for the first time since the ordeal, moved back out on my own.|12782
I had been living with my mom since that time.|12782
I am still seeing a counselor and a psychologist once a month.|12782
I do currently take zoloft once a day as an anti depressant.|12782
[BK][BK]For anybody who is thinking about doing anything like that, I urge you to take the step and tell a family member, they will react completely different then you think.|12782
I have never seen my family be closer together as we are since I decided to attempt my suicide.|12782
They were, and still are, very supportive, and it changed everything about our lives.|12782
I really want to stress to people who are thinking about it to get help, do not be afraid like I was, go get help now.|12782
[BK][BK]I will talk to anybody who wants to talk about your feelings, or any questions people have for me.|12782
I have spoke some to churches and schools here as my testimony, since suicide is very prevailant in our society now.|12782
Please, if you want to commit suicide, talk to somebody first, I will be here for anybody who wants to talk, or if anybody had any type of questions.|12782
[BK][BK]I am typing this from my phone, and have already taken my medication so I will be asleep shortly.|12782
I will answer or talk to anybody who messages me while I am awake, otherwise I will respond/fix typos etc tomorrow.|12782
"'Not like this'""[BK][BK]I became conscious in the ER."|12782
I still wanted to die, just not in a hospital in a traumatic atmosphere.|12782
I had taken paracetamol (too many to count) and had fallen unconscious after vomiting all over myself.|12782
My heart rate was dangerously low and my respiration was not ideal.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]After I came to consciousness, I accepted all treatment just so I could get out.|12782
Now I float round everyday, waiting for the ideal time to try again.|12782
[BK][BK]EDIT - thank you for all the support.|12782
Regarding the situations leading up to my attempt, I came to the sudden realization that I am one in six billion, an insignificant speck in the grand scheme of things.|12782
This is an overwhelming concept and I am still trying to confront this problem.|12782
"I am not sure if I can handle another 60 years of insignificance."""|12782
Who's talking to me?|12782
(Was my family Dr) Of course I know what year it is and what my name is.|12782
(She was asking tons of questions)  Why are my arms and legs restrained.|12782
(Apparently I attacked the nurses and Drs)|12782
Honestly, my first thought was fuck, now I have to clean this up.|12782
My second though was, I am kinda glad I am not dead.|12782
[BK][BK]Before anyone can ask, I cut my wrists.|12782
Deep enough to need stitches that I did not get, but not deep enough to die apparently.|12782
That was eight years ago.|12782
I am so thankful I did not succeed.|12782
I am grateful for my life now.|12782
I have an amazing fiance, a beautiful God daughter, and a fantastic best friend.|12782
[BK]All I can say is, if you are feeling like suicide is your only option, it is not.|12782
Seek help and support.|12782
Life sucks, but it does get better.|12782
What my mom's reaction would have been if she had found my lifeless body swinging from the rafter on her way to get her work clothes out of the laundry.|12782
Her trying to explain what had happened to my little sister.|12782
Above all, the thing I remember the most was the momement when I kicked the stool out from under me and felt weightless for a split second and realized that every problem I had, every situation I was in, except for the one I had just put myself in, was not permanent and could be fixed.|12782
After the first attempt: Fuck.|12782
Still here.|12782
[BK][BK]Second attempt: How did that not work?!|12782
What the fuck!|12782
[BK][BK]Third attempt: Alright, there is probably a reason for this.|12782
Maybe I should do that whole 'keep on keeping on' thing and figure it out.|12782
[BK][BK]Almost had a fourth attempt, gun was under my chin.|12782
Only thing that saved me was that I did not know how this woman I was developing a  relationship with would find out.|12782
We'd just begun talking through text and Skype, and I had not told her how I felt about get, yet.|12782
So I put the gun down and got a tattoo instead.|12782
Death's Head Moth on my hand to signify the change in my life.|12782
And now, we have got plans to live together by the end of the year (hopefully) and we are trying to bring life into this world.|12782
Hopefully this is not too buried, and someone reads this.|12782
It honestly does get better.|12782
Daniella, if you see this, I have loved you from the first day, you chase away my dark clouds.|12782
You're the best thing to ever happen to my life.|12782
"'i have to try again.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]this was my first attempt, one of 4.|12782
[BK][BK]after realizing i could not end my own life, and saw how difficult it is to end a life, and its not as easy as it sounds, and saw for myself thats its not really an easy way out, i realized something very important.|12782
[BK][BK]that there is difficulty even in death.|12782
so no difficulty should surpass that of death.|12782
[BK][BK]i lived by that, i make my problems less complicated, at least less complicated then suicide.|12782
[BK][BK]if anyone is reading this, and you need help [BK][BK]message me.|12782
[BK][BK]ill respond as fast as i can, i can help you.|12782
i know you do not want help, but just know that i love you, and i care for you.|12782
"I am always here for you. """|12782
Made a throwaway for this one.|12782
My friends know my real account.|12782
[BK]___[BK][BK]I have been secretly depressed and have deep anxiety.|12782
I take seroquel and zoloft daily.|12782
I fake enthusiasm so well that no one around me realizes that I am actually kind of dead inside.|12782
I put up a good smiling face for my family and friends and then crash and burn when I am alone, anxiety so strong it feels like I would die any second.|12782
My first attempt, I used my old belt around my neck and tied it around my neck.|12782
I tied the other end on my bed frame and I tightened and pulled hard till my vision was blacking out.|12782
The metal buckle broke and I lived.|12782
I felt nothing.|12782
No joy, no regret, no happiness.|12782
It was life as usual.|12782
I do not think I will try again, I just get tired of smiling for everyone else while I am breaking down inside.|12782
It''s hard.|12782
My life is an act.|12782
Everything I do is a act.|12782
My life is fake.|12782

"[BK][BK]TL;DR: 'Oh well'"" thought"""|12782
"'I want my mom. '"""""|12782
Fucking car ran out of gas.|12782
Fuck me I stll exist.|12782
Seriously, that happened.|12782
Throw away because my family knows my reddit and they think I am doing well.|12782
The first real thought was confusion.|12782
Confusion in where the plan had gone wrong, and confusion is where I was now.|12782
I jumped off the tallest bridge around, honestly there was no reason why I should still be alive.|12782
It was the world's cruel long con against me and gravity was it is method of torture.|12782
After the first thought, the second was anger.|12782
Angry because the entire point was to end my family's suffering because of me, and here I was in an obviously expensive hospital room.|12782
[BK][BK]The next thought was actually quite peaceful.|12782
Yes, there were new problems, quite immediate problems to deal with, somehow the older ones had gone to the back of my mind.|12782
Things felt calm, and for a few brief moments, I could listen to the silence and not hear it laughing at me.|12782
[BK][BK]Trying to kill yourself is not fun.|12782
It is not a first option either, not a second, third fourth or fifth.|12782
It's the last option.|12782
It's like being trapped on the top floor of a building that is burning slowly beneath you.|12782
You try to deal with i, try as long as you can.|12782
Then it starts consuming you and clouds up everything else you are doing, and sooner or later all you can do is think about the fire, see the fire, feel the fire.|12782
Any other plan you might have had soon disappears, and the only option in front of you is your very last option: jump.|12782
It's not because you think you will survive the fall, it is because you accept death and understand that jumping is the easier way to go.|12782
Either stay and suffocate, or jump and feel a few brief moments of peace.|12782
[BK][BK]It was the highest fucking bridge around and it was not high enough.|12782
Maybe next time I will just try and find a gun.|12782
The first time I attempted suicide, I hung a belt from a hook on the ceiling, put it around my neck, jumped off a chair, and tore a huge chunk out of the ceiling of my room as I crashed to the floor in a pile.|12782
"I think my first thought (after 'owwwww'"") was '""How am I going to explain this hole in the ceiling to my mother?"|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Second time, it was '""Crap, how am I going to explain these slashes on my wrists to my mother."|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Third time, it was '""Fuck, I hope these slashes on my wrists heal before I have any job interviews."|12782
I do not have any long sleeved shirts that fit me.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Fourth time, I was in the Navy and ate 4000 mg of dextromethorphan powder with a pocket knife on hand to cut myself if that did not work."|12782
Never got a chance to use it as I got so messed up from the dextromethorphan that apparently I spent two days in the hospital constantly trying to strip off all my clothes in front of everyone.|12782
"After I came to, it was like '""Shit, I am in the hospital..."|12782

When can I go home?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Fifth time, it was '""Crap, my commanding officer saw the slashes on my wrists; I hope I do not get kicked out of the Navy.'"""|12782
Note: I got kicked out of the Navy.|12782
"[BK][BK]Sixth time, after consuming all the Nytol, Unisom, and alcohol I had in the house, it was '""Dammit, I woke up."|12782
"'""[BK][BK]In other news, I think I might be a Highlander."""|12782
I did not even realize I was still alive.|12782
I rolled over that car like it was nothing.|12782
I thought I would died, thought what I was experiencing was death.|12782
[BK][BK]I found my friends, my real family, and broke down in front of them, crying and screaming in silence that I was sorry for leaving them and that I would do anything to undo my actions.|12782
[BK][BK]They turned to me one by one, they could hear me, it must be a miracle I thought, and it was, I was alive.|12782
[BK][BK]I told them what happened and they just held me, not letting go, I could feel them shaking and the tears from everyone.|12782
[BK][BK]For anyone considering suicide, there are people who love you, and when you are gone it will destroy them, and you cannot undo that|12782
throwaway because this is my biggest secret and is not something I am proud of.|12782
[BK][BK]Was 15.|12782
Retrospectively I lived a wonderful life, but decided to choose a permanent solution to temporary problems.|12782
Got my older brothers gun (Merica), went to the garage.|12782
Loaded it.|12782
[BK][BK]I swear my thoughts were ripped straight from the lyrics of a shitty 2000's pop-rock album.|12782
I imagined how bad it would make that whore feel, how all my friends would come to my funeral, how my parents who were going through a divorce would cry, how my brother would probably hear the gunshot upstairs and be the one who finds me, how my band would write a song in my honor – what an awesome show.|12782
Lot's of cool people ended this way – Kurt Cobain, Hemingway.|12782
You will miss me, I will be a legend.|12782
[BK][BK]I pulled the trigger with the gun to my temple.|12782
It felt like a hammer had hit my head, my eardrum exploded and I remember time decreasing in viscosity as I slipped out of consciousness.|12782
I felt warm.|12782
[BK][BK]I opened my eyes to a burning sensation going straight through my head.|12782
My eyes were on fire, I was coughing, I could not breathe.|12782
I could not see.|12782
I could not hear.|12782
Tears were rolling down my face.|12782
Blood was gushing down the side of my head.|12782
I did not understand what was going on.|12782
I did not think shooting off my head was this painful.|12782
[BK][BK]Then I stood up, dizzy as hell.|12782
I bolted outside from the gas filled garage and let the sun hit my face.|12782
I could not open my eyes, nor could I hear anything.|12782
The neighbors saw me and called the cops with an ambulance.|12782
[BK][BK]Turned out my brother only had tear gas bullets.|12782
I managed to make an excuse that it was an accident, that I was playing with the gun in the garage and shot myself by mistake.|12782
I had squeezed the trigger too hard, jerking the gun upwards so the burn-mark on my head was not at a direct angle.|12782
Everyone believed me.|12782
I got insane amounts of attention in the hospital from my family and all my friends.|12782
[BK][BK]I got exactly what I wanted.|12782
Now looking back – Jesus Christ what a dumbass I was.|12782
[BK][BK]EDIT - Spelling|12782
Panic.|12782
"[BK]  [BK]'Where am I?'"""|12782
"[BK]  [BK]'""Oh.'"""|12782
[BK]  [BK]I tried to strangle myself with a rope.|12782
The knot I tied managed to loosen itself enough so that I woke up again after two minutes (I passed out in < 5 seconds).|12782
I woke up gasping for air and panic in my chest.|12782
Had no clue where I was for a few moments.|12782
After realizing I failed, I did not really think much about it.|12782
I just double knotted the constrictor knot and tried again.|12782
I failed again and same reaction waking up.|12782
Then I figured I needed a rougher rope that had more friction, so I stopped for the night and went to sleep.|12782
Figured I had to get ready for school tomorrow.|12782

"'""[BK][BK]Slashed my wrists and put them under water, but gave up midway."|12782
Bandaged them up, called my counselor who told me he had a legal obligation to have me checked out.|12782
Spent the week before finals in the psych ward.|12782
Needless to say I failed that term and it killed my grades to the point where it snowballed into me dropping out of college two terms later.|12782
"Most of my family still does not know (they blame me for being '""stupid and lazy'"") and I will keep it under wraps till I die ... or until someone on Reddit asks for it, I guess :P"""|12782
So far through my life I have attempted to end it three times.|12782
The first time, I instantly regretted it, feeling guilty about being so selfish about everything, and reached out to my friends, who got me the help I needed to survive it.|12782
[BK][BK]The second attempt was more serious.|12782
I went to sleep after taking an overdose that by rights should have killed me, expecting never to wake up.|12782
Didn''t tell anyone I would done it, just did it and went to bed.|12782
The next morning I woke up, completely unable to process how the hell it had happened.|12782
Just pure confusion.|12782
[BK][BK]The third (and as of now final) attempt did not really get too far.|12782
I was on my way to the place where I was going to do it, when the police picked me up.|12782
"First thought: 'Shit, they are going to section me, are not they?'""."|12782
Yep, they did.|12782
Off to the hospital I went.|12782
Definitely the lowest points I have ever been, and not something I ever wish to repeat.|12782
It''s been 5 years since my last attempt, and I am doing better mentally than I have in a long time.|12782
"Things are looking up for me."""|12782
'Holy shit, my ear.|12782
"'""[BK]I was around sixteen and in the depths of my depression and other psychological disorders without medication when I decided to try and end my life for a third time."|12782
But this time I was sure I was not going to fail, so I took my fathers gun that he keeps for self protection, aimed at my head and fired.|12782
"I am a relatively small girl so the kick from the gun instantly blew me back and as I laid on my parents bedroom floor all I could think was, [BK]'""I am dead."|12782
I am dead.|12782
Fuck, I am dead.|12782
"'""[BK]But as I laid there for longer and longer and felt the hot blood rushing out of my ear did I realize that I was in fact not dead and in deep shit."|12782
All my previous attempts had been relatively quiet, just pretending to have a stomach bug when I was sick from trying to OD or covering the marks on my neck from trying to hang myself with makeup.|12782
But I had just fired a gun in my house and SHOT A BIT OF MY EAR OFF.|12782
I had intended to die instantly so I would not have to face the consequences of firing a gun, but I was now missing a chunk of my ear and laying in my parents bedroom.|12782
Everything was so vivid but once my parents got home it was all a blur, probably due to blood loss.|12782
"All I can remember is my mom screaming, '""What have you done?"|12782
Oh God, what have you done?|12782
"'""[BK]I got sent to inpatient for four months after this and slowly recovered and got my ear reconstructed, the only reminder being a small scar on the back of my ear, but even then, hearing loud noises scares the shit out of me and puts me into panic attacks."|12782

I had no legitimate reason to feel the way I did.|12782
My family loves me so so much and every single day I am so thankful for my mom who helped me help myself.|12782
":-)"""|12782
It's sickening how depression lies to you.|12782
It tells you your situation is uniquely inescapable.|12782
No solutions aside from that final decision that so many people make every day.|12782
If life is a bastard, depression is a sociopathic, manipulative murderer.|12782
[BK][BK]Depression is not you; it just lives inside.|12782
Starve that motherfucker to death.|12782
Everytime you go outside your comfort zone, you are telling that darkness inside you to go screw itself.|12782
[BK][BK]People always suggest the services all around to help you through suicidal behavior, but threads like this are truly the best service.|12782
[BK][BK]EDIT: Sorry for this not actually being a suicide story.|12782
I started to write something personal, but apparently I am not ready to dredge that up yet.|12782
'Plantains?|12782

Every breakfast growing up my mom made plantains.|12782
I can imagine her right now, slicing and frying them.|12782
The sound, the smell.|12782
I loved them.|12782
I can picture her now, leaving them with beans and coffee on my desk for when I woke up.|12782
A small cup of strawberries.|12782
It was such an act of love.|12782

I was so lonely.|12782
I was so stuck.|12782
He was out of town for a week and I left my dogs at a shelter for the week.|12782
I was ready.|12782
After so much vomit I remember smelling my neighbors cooking.|12782
Plantains sucked in Texas so it had been years since I had them.|12782
The small was so triggering I just balled up and wanted my mom but I did not want her know how sad I was.|12782
I moved back to LA and asked for a divorce.|12782

I really wish my friend was here to answer this question.|12782
Thank you to all of you that answered, i just miss him so goddamn much.|12782
He had PTSD like so many that we have lost.|12782
He was an amazing person that lit up the room whenever he walked in and i never heard a negative word spoken about him ever.|12782
To those of you that failed, please try to remember that there are many people that care about you and will listen to you, even if its just us internet strangers.|12782
I cant stress this enough.|12782
Please please please talk to someone.|12782
I got a message from my friend the night he went through with it, but i thought it was just one of his bad moods he was in.|12782
I regret not driving to his house every single day of my life.|12782

I know he was going through hell but please please please talk to someone and try to get help.|12782

I once tried to commit suicide in front of my brother.|12782
I did not realize I would scar him for life but I wanted to end it (I was 14 and he was 6).|12782
[BK][BK]That school year, I went through a family crisis (my parents ALMOST divorced).|12782
"I was bullied constantly and all the adults did NOTHING but tell me to 'man up'""."|12782
[BK][BK]I beat up one of my bullies and was put on six months probation and home based for a week.|12782
"Texas takes '""Zero Tolerance'"" seriously and '""self defense'"" does not exist in schools."|12782
[BK][BK]I thought the bullying would end there but it was just the beginning.|12782
My classmates knew what was in store for me if I fought again and did ALL they could to antagonize me.|12782
They knew I could not fight back; they wanted to get me out.|12782
[BK][BK]After getting another bad report card, I decided to end it.|12782
I tried to jump off the stairs.|12782
I tried to stab myself.|12782
When those things did not work, I decided to hang myself.|12782
[BK][BK]What stopped me?|12782
[BK][BK]The Holy Spirit and my brother''s crying.|12782
"[BK][BK]While I was choking on the rope, I heard a voice saying '""Don''t do it."|12782
You got something great coming.|12782
"Just stick around'""."|12782
The voice was very calming.|12782
My brother crying out for me helped too.|12782
[BK][BK]Though I did not kill myself, I went through a HARSH 15 year addiction to porn afterwards.|12782
Porn was a great stress reliever.|12782
What started as a means to get over the crap I went through became mandatory.|12782
Over the years, I lost relationships with great people due to my addiction.|12782
[BK][BK]By the grace of God, I got over my addiction coming up seven months ago and my life is back on track.|12782
[BK][BK]People say that black people do not commit (or attempt to commit) suicide are wrong.|12782

"[BK][BK]All I wanted that time was for someone to listen to me."""|12782
I was only 14 when I really tried to kill myself.|12782
I would always chickened out last minuite every other time.|12782
So this time I did something I could not back out of.|12782
I mixed some pills with a bottle of alcohol, all stolen from around the house.|12782
I knew my parents would be back late and I was home alone.|12782
I told the one person who I hoped still cared about me goodbye, then I lay down.|12782
[BK][BK]My dad came home from work early.|12782
I had not passed out, I was groggy and sluring my speech and he kept asking me what I would done.|12782
I think I had acess to something sharp too and he was scared I would hurt myself further but somehow I do not exactly remember he got me to the hospital and I spent all night throwing up and blacking out and in the morning I was still there.|12782
[BK][BK]And I thought, I would have died if it were not for my dad.|12782
The person I told did not do anything to try to stop me.|12782
I thought I needed to sort out my priorities and to see who actually did care and cut out those who did not.|12782
[BK][BK]I never tried again.|12782
Mainly because I did not want to mess it up, I was told that what I had taken would be more likely to seriously innure me and give me a life long disability than outright kill me.|12782
I do not know if that is true but it svared me far more than death ever could.|12782
I spent a long time depressed and suicidal but eventually I got better.|12782
When I was teenager and have very deep depression I somehow managed to find my father''s revolver and several bullets.|12782
I loaded three of them so the chances will be 50/50 and actually did the thing.|12782
I was so nervous that when I heard quiet click noise I thought that was the end.|12782
"After couple minutes of shock I finally realized nothing happened, and first thing came to mind was 'OK, so if fate do not want me to die I will try to manage myself'""."|12782
"Can''t say my life was not shit after that, but it was definitely better."""|12782
Shiiiiiiit the one time I could actually add something to the tread and it is a little late .|12782
But I am still gonna type it cause it is 1 a.m. and I cannot sleep well I have tried to kill myself about 4 Times, first time was in high school I took a razor blade to my neck , luckily a nearby student saw it and told an officer (I was outside behind the school) at the emergency room the doctor on call told me if I went just went a little deeper I could have hit a artery and I would have died .|12782
After I was stitched up and question by the hospital psychologist I was admitted to the mental care wing of the hospital  .|12782
After a week I left and for some reason I never really thought of it I never realized how big of a deal it was I guess I still  do not.|12782
"I did not really think it was  crazy or an insane thing to do it, to me it was the same As spilling milk it was something people should not cry over, I did not think ' boy I am glad I did not die '"" I just did not care ."|12782
"The next couple of times I just kinda shrug my shoulders and thought '""oops that is my bad, that is my blunder'""."|12782
"I do not know what that says about me but suicide was never an unspeakable or unforgivable act it just is """|12782
When I was 20 I was going through a rough spot and I was in a really bad relationship that lasted 6 years.|12782
She cheated on me all the time, was verbally abusive and an all around horrible person.|12782
One night (Around 2am) I could not take it anymore and I decided to take my car down a local street where many others have lost control and died.|12782
There are some serious bumps and hills where every tree has flowers/memorials on it.|12782
[BK]  [BK]I was doing about 95mph when I hit the bumps and lost it...  [BK]  [BK][BK]My car spun out of control and it felt like time completely stopped then went in to fast forward.|12782
[BK]When my car had finally came to a halt I was in the center of the road.|12782
Untouched.|12782
[BK]  [BK][BK]At that moment I felt a purpose.|12782
I was not supposed to die.|12782
[BK]There was something more waiting for me.|12782
[BK]I did not know what the reason was but there was this deep sense of life.|12782
[BK][BK]After sitting there in silence for about 10 minutes, I turned around, went back home and cried myself to sleep.|12782
[BK]The next morning I drove down that same road.|12782
[BK]I remember exactly where I started to lose control because there is an old gate to an abandoned barn right where the first bump is.|12782
[BK]I saw the tire tracks...|12782
They went straight in to the woods...  [BK]And the tracks came back out about 10-20 feet down the road and continued to spin until I stopped.|12782
[BK]I was never one to believe in miracles or guardian angels but God had my back that day.|12782
[BK]I finally broke it off with my long term girlfriend that weekend.|12782
[BK]I met the most amazing girl not long after and we are married now.|12782
[BK]I have graduated college and I am living a pretty awesome life.|12782
[BK]Total 180 from where I was at a few years back.|12782
[BK][BK]The moral of the story is just let time & God do his thing.|12782
[BK]There is purpose in everyone, even if you do not feel it.|12782
[BK]You have worth and meaning to someone, somewhere.|12782
[BK]Don't give up.|12782
Don't lose hope.|12782
You are loved.|12782
Probably will get buried, but I think in some ways I need to share this for me.|12782
[BK][BK]I have attempted twice.|12782
The first time I do not even know if I was intending to die...I just knew I did not want to wake up, if that makes sense.|12782
I was just so so tired, endlessly tired, so I swallowed a bottle of pills to finally get some peace and quiet.|12782
"My first thought upon waking up was 'Damn, I want to go back to sleep'"", followed by '""Shit, let me hide this."|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I am miles away from the person I was then, thank god."|12782
I am generally pretty happy and have lead an exciting life so far (I am only 21), but still I  acknowledge I will have to continue to fight off depression and anxiety the rest of my life.|12782
If I do not think positively or just use ''mindfulness'', I can easily see my thoughts start to dip.|12782
And you know what, fighting a naturally negative mind is exhausting sometimes.|12782
"Today it sure is, I feel pretty lonely today, but writing about this helps me acknowledge why I feel the way I do I guess."""|12782
I have never posted on Reddit before, but I think it could be helpful to someone, so I think it might be useful.|12782
Another thing I should mention is I have attempted on numerous occasions, so I can give a few thoughts after several of my attempts.|12782
[BK][BK]I was bullied quite badly, when I started comprehensive school, and it was when I would just started there too, and the teachers did not really do much about it, and my family picked on me quite a bit too, so with everything piling up, I started attempting, at first I would get my dressing gown, and tie the belt around my neck, a part of me knew this would not kill me, without me hanging, but I believe on a subconscious level, I wanted to find out if I would be able to hang myself.|12782
[BK][BK]Another attempt was to drown myself, in the bath, I submerged myself, and after a few tries of this I got very close, but at the last minute, my body just brought itself out of the water, and I started breathing, and the closer I got, the more unpleasant it felt, so I stopped, I did not really have a thought, after this, I just got out and carried on as normal, but I did find it too unpleasant to try again.|12782
[BK][BK]On another attempt (this was my first year of college, I had taken 2 weeks off, due to feeling badly depressed, and when I had started college I started getting suicidal thoughts as well, which I would never had before and some other issues got worse as well.)|12782
After the 2 weeks off, I was feeling really low, a bit worthless and insecure too, and in a way, I felt inferior, so one morning before college, I put a can of aerosol up my nose, thought for a couple of minutes, but I decided to do it, so I sprayed, but with the way it was directed, it was more directed at my nose, rather than up it, so it failed, I was still a bit down and guilty (something which I usually feel, after an attempt) but I just went to college as I should have.|12782
[BK][BK]I am better now, I do get bad every now and then, and I do sometimes, wonder what would everything be like if I were successful, or if I was not here, but I found hope, it was not easy, but I started to look after myself, not in a vain way, but at those times, I did not really love myself, so I started to do that, and it does help, I took it one step at a time, but I eventually got through it.|12782
Also, if anyone here ever needs a chat or something, then you can feel free to PM me, I know this sounds cliché, but I am a good listener, and I care, so I will do my best to help, if I can.|12782
I am not a counsellor or doctor or anything like that, but if anyone needs help, I will do my best to help.|12782
On 12/12/12 (easiest day to remember) I overdosed on 40 Tylenol with codeine.|12782
I had a really bad eating disorder in highschool, so bad that I ended up getting an ulcer (excessive stomach acid from bulimia) and got a prescription for the Tylenol.|12782
I was being reckless at school and smoked some pot and got in trouble so my dad had to pick me up.|12782
decided I could not fuck up anymore than I had so I went home and took all the pills I had left in the bottle.|12782
As an aside, I would been cutting and burning my arms for a while and had been in and out of different psych hospitals for a few years so my dad figured I would do something reckless after the suspension.|12782
He noticed I was twitching and looked not like myself and immediately knew I had done something stupid.|12782
Either way one thing led to another and I was at the hospital fighting a nurse who tried to give me Pepcid (medicine to counteract the OD) and I remember screaming and telling them to just let me die, things were all a bit fuzzy from this day.|12782
Then it got worse because as it turns out I am deathly allergic to Pepcid and I went into anaphylactic shock right infront of my parents after they would just watched me scream about wanting to die.|12782
So this was a shitshow.|12782
Just a mess where 16 year old me is ruining everything.|12782
I faded out of consciousness and woke up with a headache but saw my parents at the end of the bed.|12782
My first thought was 'fuck.|12782
"I cannot even kill myself.'"""|12782
So of course I was put into intensive care and four years later I am doing really well at college and do not deal with the same issues anymore.|12782
I think what changed things was seeing how distraught my parents were at the end of the bed watching me hopelessly.|12782
I am really good at a lot of stuff I do, I can run 10 miles and I have a 4.0 and in general am doing really well, but I cannot fucking kill myself.|12782
"Today, I am pretty glad I am bad at suicide and I am even more thankful that I was given parents who never ever even thought of giving up on me. """|12782
'The baby too?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Pregnant teen."|12782
Couldn''t deal anymore.|12782
Did lose the baby.|12782
"[BK][BK]and recently it was  '""I thought I would not feel the cold this much'""  walked deep into the woods and into the snow."|12782
Found unconscious by my SO.|12782
But I guess more than my actually thinking was the feeling of shame.|12782
I knew I let him down.|12782
And As much as I would like to say I wouldnt do it again.|12782
I think about it every day.|12782
"Just waiting for the most convenient time in my loved ones lives honestly."""|12782
Waking up the next day completely fine, wondering how I could have failed myself again.|12782
Ended up trying again the following week with the same results, and just kind of gave up and accepted the fact that I am a failure.|12782
[BK][BK]Although for the record, I am doing a lot better now.|12782
Six five hundred mg Vicodin and a bottle of rum did not do the trick.|12782
But it put me out for an entire day.|12782
I woke up still depressed but with an odd sense of hope.|12782
Difficult to describe.|12782
"'Thank you, Jesus'""[BK][BK]I blame a guardian angel for being the only thing getting me down."|12782
The way I was hung was correct.|12782
Something undid my rope nice and slowly, in mid air as if it was mimicking the movements a human would make holding it, then I felt something lift me and gently place me on the ground.|12782
Been a stern believer in my fate from 90% to 200% from what I saw as I hung there blacking it.|12782
I luckily never succeeded.|12782
Started the process of a new life afterwards.|12782
Even when times are extremely tough, I plow through.|12782
"I get stressed, but never depressed or suicidal anymore."""|12782
"The first few times was just 'Woah.'"""|12782
"then after that it was '""Of course, I guess I cannot die.'"""|12782
"repeatedly. """|12782
'I see my own blood.|12782
Cover the wound!|12782
Cover the wound!|12782
"I do not want to die yet!'"""""|12782
This should have worked is there a reason I am still here??|12782
[BK]I find it strange the first post I saw was this one:[BK]   Ironically enough on April 9th (just a couple days ago)  marked it a year since my attempt.|12782
And I guess my conscious thought now would be im thankful it did not work because now I will get to see my 20th birthday this Wednesday I have learned a lot even though sometimes there are still weak moments.....|12782
'What the hell is going on!|12782
Why are there spiders everywhere?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]My first attempt was with two full bottles of Tylenol."|12782
I knew over the counter stuff was less likely to work so I took a lot.|12782
I woke up in my room like 18 hours later.|12782
I could understand people, but there was this sort of a delay in my reaction time.|12782
The worst part is I was so messed up I was hallucinating that my skin was covered in small spiders, and so was the floor.|12782
I stayed curled up in the corner of my bed for another full 24 hours until the hallucinations stopped.|12782
Fucking terrible.|12782
[BK][BK]I remember feeling this weird mix of guilt, fear, and disappointment.|12782
How did that not work?|12782
Why did I do something so stupid?|12782
Am I going to be okay?|12782
What will actually work next time?|12782
[BK][BK]I am ashamed to say it (and honestly I have never told anyone), but I have tried a total of 26 times to kill myself.|12782
Most of them were in the span of just a few years when I was at my lowest.|12782
I have tried hanging, drowning, asphyxiation, rat poison, bug poison, alcohol, cutting, and more over the counter stuff than I care to admit.|12782
"Every time I came to I had this sort of sense like, '""better luck next time,'"" or something to that effect."|12782
It''s like I was not even sad or scared anymore.|12782
I just was not anything, and that is why I kept trying.|12782
[BK][BK]I am transgender.|12782
"It took me a very long time to accept who I am, and not feel like I should be dead because I will never be '""normal'""."|12782
Three years since my last attempt, and I am proud to say I am glad I am not normal.|12782
I am a stronger, more compassionate person than I ever thought I would be back then, and I am so elated I am here to experience life as a happy healthy version of me.|12782
I am in love, i have a great job, and a huge network of people who i know genuinely care about me.|12782
I am even finally gearing up for my surgery!|12782
Just working on saving some more of the money I need and I will be all set!|12782
[BK][BK]By this point I am pretty sure I am immortal, so I might as well so everything I can to make the best of things.|12782
Anyway, thanks for letting me share.|12782
"I feel better."""|12782
"And I quote 'AW COME ON'"""""|12782
"'shit, man I feel fucked up'"", only in spanish."|12782
"I was really woozy and felt really '""dry'"" from all the pills."|12782
"Like a really strange hangover times 1000."""|12782
I woke up in a hospital bed, and I swear to God, the most beautiful woman I have ever seen was hovering over me and said everything is going to be alright.|12782
I then realized where I was, and how much I regretted swallowing a bottle of pills and then I saw the looks on my family's faces and realized that if I have people that care about me that much, how can I be so selfish?|12782
I had long suffered depression without ever knowing what it was, and for most of my life thought it normal to feel like I had to atone for some nameless, unmentionable atrocity.|12782
[BK][BK]In my early twenties it all came to breaking point during my first year of postgraduate research.|12782
"Just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong that year - my projects were failing (and not even in a useful, 'I could go in that direction instead!'"""|12782
kind of way), I was given a fortnights'' notice to vacate the family home, my 4-year relationship was on the rocks, and I was excruciatingly lonely at the bottom of the totem pole at the lab, with a supervisor who did not know how to and/or want to relate to me.|12782
[BK][BK]My then-partner found me sobbing in my underwear in the kitchen that night, halfway through making the first cut.|12782
It took two people (the flatmate helped) to pull clothes on me, then drag me to the local Emergency Department.|12782
"[BK][BK]My first thought on being tackled in the kitchen was a bitter, '""Great, so I am even a failure at this as well.'"""|12782
That echoed through the next five hours being watched by the beady eyes of three no-nonsense orderlies, who did not hesitate in almost literally sitting on me when I was caught trying again while the nurses'' backs were turned.|12782
[BK][BK]Over a decade''s worth of therapy and meds later, I am much more functional.|12782
"Progress has been slow but definite, and I can emphatically now say that the place I was that night is a place where I never want to be again."""|12782
'I must look like a fuckin idiot.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I had cut my arms to pieces, took silly amounts of painkillers, huffed exhaust for 45 minutes, and then got in my car and drove it 70 miles an hour into a light pole."|12782
Turns out the pole was designed to give when hit, so my car just flipped and spun and landed upright 100 yards or so from the interstate.|12782
I was then confronted with loads of Good Samaritans who wanted to help, among them a nurse who knew what she was doing.|12782
At first I would not get out, but when she explained that she was going to wait until I did and that the car might explode, I could not help but relent.|12782
Apart from the self-inflicted ones, I was completely uninjured.|12782
This was seven years ago.|12782
I have been searching spiritually ever since.|12782
This is the most succinctly I have ever managed to tell this story.|12782
Gotta get back to work.|12782
Also, fuck a throwaway.|12782
"I did what I did and it is now part of who I am. """|12782
'Ew.|12782
Ow.|12782
Oh fuck, I did that.|12782
Fuck, this is embarrassing.|12782
Oh shit, the nurses called my mom.|12782
Oh fuck, this is embarrassing.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I came to in the internal medicine ward, hungover and with teeth stained black with medical charcoal, two IV bags dripping into my arm."|12782
[BK][BK]I would gotten shitfaced and od''d on acetaminophen (I would had to visit three separate pharmacies to buy enough for my intentions).|12782
In what in my recollection is a fuzz of intoxication and darkness of the night, I would called the ambulance on myself.|12782
I would spent the night vomiting black and scream-crying in the ICU.|12782
"I remember being wheeled out of the ICU and asking a nurse '""Am I going to die?'"""|12782
"and her answering '""No'""."|12782
[BK][BK]Before leaving my home, I would packed a spare pair of pants - not a book or phone charger or anything useful, really.|12782
After the nurses trusted that I was not going to bolt, they allowed me to drag the heavy IV pole down the hall, into the elevator, through the emergency room lobby and out to the parking lot to smoke cigarettes.|12782
[BK][BK]The next day, I was interviewed by a pair of medical health crisis workers.|12782
I told them I was embarrassed (because I would tried to kill myself and also because I would executed it so half-assedly), and fine, and scared of going home.|12782
[BK][BK]They put me in the closed ward.|12782
No door out, no asking to leave.|12782
A self-described manic gave me a (thorough yet short) tour.|12782
I needed to pee, and learned that I needed to ask a guard to open the door to the bathroom, and was not allowed to lock it behind me.|12782
I smoked a cigarette in a smoking booth with a lighter chained to the wall.|12782
After only an hour, the doctor came to get me out of the ward.|12782
[BK][BK]And just like that, they showed me the door.|12782
There I was, in the January cold, feeling absurd.|12782
I walked home.|12782
[BK][BK]Returning to my apartment and my room was the strangest thing I have experienced in my life.|12782
I felt reborn, and like an archaeologist.|12782
The empty bottles of pills and liquor.|12782
The computer still on, the clothes, the guitar that I only played when no one heard - the scattered artifacts of a normal life.|12782
The things that held meaning only to me.|12782
What would my family have thought at the sight?|12782
It was bizarre to think that if the me that tried to kill me had been more ruthless, that would have been the remains of me.|12782
[BK][BK]And at the end of that, I find it hilarious that the stress of cleaning up before people come over would not end at death.|12782
Fuck having people over.|12782
"[BK][BK]I have never shared much of this with anyone, so if you read this, thanks."""|12782
Well, I was succeeding, but I realized how amazing it felt to be at peace and ended up using my last strength to call 911.|12782
[BK]After the whole drug trip and recovery 4 days later I went- fuck.|12782
Im so fucked.|12782
[BK][BK]I was leaving a horrible relative foster home to a horrible group home.|12782
At least a year later I got to be with a lovely lady for two years who I still keep in touch with.|12782
She really saved me and would stay up all night with us when we felt that way again.|12782
When I was starting high school I decided to move to Florida with my mom.|12782
My parents had divorced and my mom packed up and left one day.|12782
I went from living her to living with my dad suddenly.|12782
My dad was incredibly poor and mean to me (looking back it was because of the stress of raising five kids with no money, we wasnt mean he was depressed).|12782
Anyway I moved to Florida and everyone was cruel to me.|12782
I had no friends, no one was even nice to me.|12782
I was alone all the time and incredibly depressed.|12782
No one in Indiana wanted me and neither did anyone in Florida.|12782
[BK][BK]So one night I went out and threw myself off of The Pier in Saint Petersburg (its a large shopping building that is on a Pier that extends into Tampa Bay).|12782
I just sort of climbed the railing and jumped in during high waves because of a storm.|12782
I figured no one would find me because it was late at night.|12782
[BK][BK]When I came to there were a group of four or five homeless guys that were trying to help me.|12782
I had worn a bunch of heavy clothing to weigh me down.|12782
They had stripped me down to my essentials (shirt and shorts).|12782
One was sprinting down the beach leading the EMTs to me.|12782
[BK][BK]When I actually was able to make thoughts again I remember just thinking about how people that had nothing in life worked so hard to save my life.|12782
I vowed to never let my struggle with the feeling of having nothing ever get the better of me again.|12782
I moved back to Indiana and started donating and working with the homeless.|12782
I vowed to dedicate my life to those less fortunate than myself, because I owe them my life.|12782
[BK][BK]I never did meet the five guys that saved me again.|12782
[BK][BK]TL:DR Tried to drown myself, was saved by group of homeless men, vowed to dedicate life to helping others.|12782
Shame.|12782
That I had gotten myself into such a dark place I was willing to put my close loved ones back into the same position we had all just experienced with the loss of my grandfather to suicide just a few months prior.|12782
Shame.|12782
That I was willing to hurt myself and potentially my future daughter as the result my failed attempt.|12782
Even almost three years later, I still think about dying almost every day.|12782
It's a struggle and it is very hard when you want something so badly though you know it is wrong and you should not allow yourself to have it.|12782
I guess as difficult as it is I am lucky to have her to remind me to not give in.|12782
Who else is going to be dependable enough to care for her the way I do?|12782
It was fragments of things.|12782
All I remember from the first part after it is wanting things to go back to the way they used to be before all the bullshit in my life started, wishing it had worked, and just wanting to sleep for a very long time until everything was okay.|12782
[BK]I was 18 and in an a relationship that that was abusive in every way possible except physically.|12782
I have no doubts that it would have turned physical if I had not left.|12782
And I only left after he raped me.|12782
That was over 5 years ago.|12782
Things have gotten better but you do not forget or leave behind something like that.|12782
Most days are fine but there are some I just cannot handle certain things.|12782
Nights are the worst.|12782
I have had multiple exes tell me I have nightmares far more often than I remember.|12782
My dog helps me out with that now though, she is learned to wake me up if I am having a really bad one.|12782
"I asked the police officer, 'do I have to pay the trespassing charge?'""."|12782
He laughed and said not to worry about it.|12782
"Turns out I did not. """|12782
*God damn, okay tell them it was a mistake.|12782
*[BK][BK]'I got confused about my meds, it was just a mistake.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]They believed me the first couple of times."|12782
They did not believe the hanging was accidental though.|12782
[BK][BK]Oddly, the one time I overdosed on accident, it was assumed to be a suicide attempt.|12782
"I was given codeine cough syrup and between the pharmacist mixing it at double strength and me reading '""4 tsp a day'"" as '""4 tbsp a dose'"" I ODed big time."|12782
I had pneumonia on top of it so ended up waking up three days later in a hospital.|12782
[BK][BK]On the other hand, I felt GREAT when I woke up.|12782
My cough was so much better after getting some sleep (I had not slept more than fifteen minutes or so for the last few weeks) and while I was out they used some kind of breathing treatment on me that cleared up at least half the yuck out of me.|12782
[BK][BK]Thankfully my doctor asked for the remaining syrup to be tested and found it was mixed to the highest strength, not the lower strength the doctor ordered for me.|12782
Doc figured if it had been an actual suicide I,would have swallowed the whole bottle, not just the mega dose I thought was a normal dose.|12782
"(He was right)"""|12782
I got consumed by an immense fear.|12782
The moment I realized what I had tried to do, it dawned on me.|12782
[BK]My pain would stop, but so would everything else.|12782
[BK][BK]I would miss so many things if I had ended it on that day.|12782
I would not ever again walk in a calm summer evening, a slight chill breeze in the air.|12782
I would not ever sit on a balcony and watch the light clouds roll through the skies at night.|12782
I would not ever know true love, the feeling of being held by someone, early in the morning, just listening to each other breathe.|12782
I would not ever be able to see my friends and share our laughter, our tears, our aspirations, our late night talks, ever again.|12782
I would miss so many amazing stories being told.|12782
I would miss seeing so many places.|12782
Experiences.|12782
[BK][BK]So I just broke down and cried for a solid couple of hours.|12782
I carried on the next day.|12782
[BK][BK]I still experience depression.|12782
But I have never felt low enough again to get to that place.|12782
Because no matter how low I feel, I make myself remember: there is so much more beauty in the world.|12782
We are what we choose to be and what we do.|12782
We can form the experiences we want.|12782
[BK][BK]I have had so many wonderful things happen to me since then and I hope everyone who feels this way realizes there is so much they can contribute, that they can do whatever they want.|12782
There is so much beauty out there.|12782
I promise, there is so much out there waiting for you.|12782
It eventually gets better.|12782
It's not an easy road.|12782
But it is so much better to take that road than not at all.|12782
There's a reason I am still here, and it is not my time yet.|12782
To this day I help others who struggle with depression and self destructive tendencies.|12782
I swore to myself that day, as long as I am still alive, no one would ever feel as lonely as I once did.|12782
I was very delirious when I woke up.|12782
I was in the ICU connected to a few IV''s, a heart monitor, and a catheter (and probably other things, but I do not remember much).|12782
I remember my sisters concerned face above me, and I remember the room''s TV in the corner.|12782
I was not aware that I was in the hospital, or that I would tried to kill myself.|12782
All that I could think of was the stupid television.|12782
[BK][BK]See, I had a television about the same size.|12782
A 50' Samsung.|12782
But this TV was a Sharp.|12782
I could not figure out why someone would break into my place, steal my Samsung TV, and replace it with a slightly shittier TV.|12782
I spent 2 days trying to figure it out.|12782
"[BK][BK]Anyways, apparently I did nothing but say '""I am sorry'"" for 3 days, so I guess I was sorry that I tried to kill myself."""|12782
I tried to hang myself.|12782
On a very desparate day, i watched a video on how to make noose and that night i set it up to just stop me about 1m (?)|12782
above the floor.|12782
I pushed away all other furniture just so i wont be able to reach them and survive, steped on the back of a chair put the noose on and kicked the chair.|12782
[BK]I immediatly felt some sort of blackness (did i pass out?|12782
), severe pain around my neck and above all, i felt my feet touching the ground!|12782
Turns out climbing rope can strech out like a motherfucker.|12782
It was the only rope at the house and i didnt even think that this might happen.|12782
"[BK]I came to, and for a blink of an eye i thought 'fuck yes i am alive!'"""|12782
I looked around and reached for the desk by extending my leg, fortunatly i did reach it and pulled it towards me.|12782
There were scissors on it.|12782
I cut the rope and went straight to a mirror, i had a huge round burnmark around my neck, (went away after a year) and some hair pulled out.|12782
[BK]I remember how fucking scared i was and how fucking relieved i was to be alive!|12782
[BK][BK]That was about 3 years ago and i m still glad i didnt die.|12782
On very intense awful moments i will fantasize that i have to-will do it, but i KNOW that i will not.|12782
[BK][BK]Please nobody do this.|12782
"Life is everything."""|12782
I was bullied when I was younger mostly, because my looks, but also for my behaviour.|12782
The reason behind my behaviour was the fact that I have ADHD, which nobody knew at the time.|12782
so to the main point, i´ve tried to kill myself several times but have failed everytime and every time I fail my reaction has been both happy and sad.|12782
Happy because my family wouldn´t get the new that I killed myself, but sad because I was still here and that I knew that I would still get bullied...|12782
When I was in something in between 1:st and 5:th grade i tried to strangle myself with a jumprope and later on I tried to do the same thing but with a regular belt.. Been depressed and suicidal for years, but now im just depressed.|12782
[BK]But If i wouldn´t be here today I wouldn´t have had the chance to go to Dreamhack Masters Malmö (CSGO event) and interview two of my idols and rolemodels, whereas one has been my rolemodel since I started watching CSGO, and he´s like a mentor to me so... yeaah.|12782
hope this answers your question a bit..|12782
Needed to get out some feelings aswell, hope that´s okay xD|12782
"'god dammit'"""""|12782
I felt more alone than I ever had before.|12782
The few people in my life that I thought may care I was gone were now angry with me and distant.|12782
No one wanted to associate or talk with me.|12782
I was now in physical pain, not just the emotional pain I had been in, and wanted some positive attention but all I received was anger.|12782
I was in the hospital, and even the doctors were upset.|12782
[BK][BK]I had not expected that.|12782
I thought I would either succeed, or at least if I failed receive an outpouring of grief and understanding of the real struggles I faced.|12782
It turned out so completely different than I imagined.|12782
In the end, I hurt the only people who I cared about, and pushed them out of my life.|12782
That was several decades ago, and I have only reconciled with my mother -- I was never able to repair the relationships with anyone else.|12782
[BK][BK]My second thoughts were how to move forward.|12782
When you plan suicide, you do not spend much if any time thinking about the aftermath if you fail.|12782
Lying in a hospital bed you spend a LOT of time thinking about what comes next.|12782
It took a lot of therapy and life changes to move forward.|12782
Way too late for any visibility, but I will share it anyway.|12782
[BK][BK]When I was in the fifth grade I had a lot of shit going on (bullying mainly), so one day I just said fuck everything and got a .357 out of the cabinet and put it to my head.|12782
[BK][BK]Against all odds the piece of shit jammed.|12782
"So after I realized what happened I just thought 'is it really that bad?'"""|12782
Then I took a shower and wiped all the shit off.|12782
[BK][BK]It''s funny because I take that for granted a lot, but that gun should not have jammed.|12782
It was using .38 special rounds which is why, but it still is not very common.|12782
"[BK][BK]Nowadays I am never depressed and I am pretty much the opposite of who I was 5 years ago."""|12782
I have never personally attempted suicide but I have been through and still go through my own bouts of depression and my best friend has struggled with it a lot more and has attempted to kill himself twice now.|12782
For those wondering, he is doing much better now and I am doing alright.|12782
Every day has it is own challenges, big or small, but I always try to remind myself of the quote, 'This too shall pass.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I cannot quite remember the details of the story/origin behind it at the moment and do not feel like looking it up but it is something along the lines of a king was bored with his life so he told someone to make or write him something he could look at or read that would make him sad when he was happy, and also make him happy when he was sad."|12782
After puzzling over it for some time they finally came back with a ring for him that was inscribed with that quote.|12782
[BK][BK]It has always been comforting to me, because it has always proven itself to be true in my own experience.|12782
It may help some, it may not, I just wanted to share it either way.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: I know I probably should not share or say what I am about to say because some may find it in poor taste but fuck it, I am going to anyway because I am laughing and I want to try to help others laugh as well.|12782
Even if it is only one other weirdo like me out there somewhere in the void, it will be worth it to me at least..[BK]My Dad has gifted me a dark sense of humor and he recently passed away which has been really hard for me.|12782
"But reading through this thread, seeing all these quotes from people who had just tried to kill themselves and the inevitable '""it can only go up from here'"" comments, I cannot help but think of what my dad might have said and just smile."|12782
"Like, '""Sure, life may go up again, but that''ll just give me a higher place to jump from.'"""|12782
I realize some, probably most, do not find that funny.|12782
"But I do, because it reminds me of my dad and I really miss him."""|12782
I had accepted I was alive just from where I had gone.|12782
[BK]Apparently I did die and had to be brought back.|12782
[BK]And I remember exactly why and how I came back.|12782
[BK]I realized I was too scared of how people would be hurt and I forced myself back into myself.|12782
[BK]So when I woke up I just thought 'This sucks but it is the right thing.|12782
"'""[BK]I did not realize I had actually succeeded in killing myself until I was in the psycheward and was let know."|12782
[BK]Now I sometimes wonder what would have happened had I not decided to come back.|12782
"[BK][BK]But then I remember everything that is happened since then and come back to the first thought '""This sucks, but it is right."|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I was only 14 at the time, I am 23 now and I know I would have lost just as much as everybody else had I passed."""|12782
I attempted suicide once when I was 17.|12782
[BK][BK]My mom and sister came home and caught me just as I was doing it.|12782
[BK][BK]My first thought and feeling?|12782
Instant regret.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not mean the regret you feel when you pass up on an outing with friends, or do not ask out your crush.|12782
This was a regret which was crippling.|12782
The look in my mom''s eyes that night is something I will never ever forget.|12782
"[BK][BK]Up until that moment, I have heard the whole 'suicide is selfish'"" on TV and from school and blew it off as insignificant."|12782
How could a bit of brief sadness from my family be worse than the pain I thought I already put the and myself through?|12782
[BK][BK]But her eyes.|12782
The look on her face when she knew I was almost gone.|12782
It hurt me worse than anything, and I knew I could never ever let her feel that way again.|12782
[BK][BK]The first month after that was hard.|12782
She worried non stop, but we talked more.|12782
In a way.|12782
The experience made us closer.|12782
[BK][BK]Don''t get me wrong.|12782
"If I could go back, I would stop myself before she had the chance to. """|12782
"'I just fucked up royally.'"""|12782
[BK][BK][BK]I wished I had not done it, not because I wanted to be alive, but because not succeeding meant that I was going to be forced to get help (obviously, I am thankful for that now).|12782
I was bitter about it for a long time.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]Now, I am meeting with my doctor tomorrow to discuss weaning me off of my SSRIs.|12782
"It will be four years to the date of my attempt in another month. """|12782
"'I am covered in vomit'"" did not remember vomiting at all but it was everywhere in my bathroom I took two bottles of acetaminophen."|12782
All I remember of the night before was taking the pills going to the bathroom and walking around in the dark unaware of where I was I got really mad because I kept banging my face on the walls and stubbing my toes,then all I remember is waking up with vomit all over me and the bathroom.|12782
"[BK][BK]On a related note about two years later under the influence of ambien I was in my usually state of mind for being alone which was talking to myself about the need to kill myself and how much I hate myself when I had the realization that [BK]'""If anyone else talked to me the way I talk to myself I would fucking kill them; I have wasted three years of my life like this, either I can kill myself now or try something different.'"""|12782
"I am trying something different."""|12782
"'What now?'"""|12782
[BK][BK]I saw my dad come into the room I was in while they were forcing me to stay awake, while they were pumping my stomach.|12782
The look on his face will always stay with me.|12782
"But '""what now'"" is what I remember thinking first."|12782
What do I do with myself now.|12782
"What happens now that it is all out in the open. """|12782
I wanted my Mom and Dad.|12782
'Damn, I thought it would work this time.|12782
"'""[BK]I have actually tried a couple of times, with the worst experience being trying to hang myself."|12782
It hurt so much, especially when you are conscious throughout the first few minutes.|12782
The only saving grace was that I fainted halfway through and did not know what happened afterwards.|12782
Apparently, the rope snapped right after I lost consciousness and, well, let me live.|12782
The worst was that I was only starting high school.|12782
I had so much to live for, but I chose to throw it away so carelessly.|12782
"I will not go into details about my other attempts, but this one was definitely the worst. """|12782
I do not remember what my first thought was.|12782
I attempted to poison myself with carbon monoxide in my car far in an isolate parking lot, far, far away.|12782
[BK][BK]The car I had at the time was shit and shut off because of a bad engine before I could finally succumb to the poisoning.|12782
But I remember I was incredibly hazy and confused.|12782
Like a drunk confusion.|12782
Disassociated.|12782
Eyes swollen as fuck.|12782
[BK][BK]I drove home to see my best friend and mother in a panic (my best friend was my last call good-bye and my work informed my mother I rage quit my job and was very unsafe).|12782
For the first time my mom believed how serious I was about my depression and desire to die.|12782
And it took a while, but I got counseling and help.|12782
[BK][BK]I wish I could tell you my first thought, but the only thought I can have right now is that I am happy my car was a piece of shit and life gave me another chance.|12782
[BK][BK]Now I am married, a college grad, and doing really well, counseling those who struggle with depression through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.|12782
First time I pulled the trigger and the gun did not go off I was pissed that it did not work.|12782
Getting pissed off about it brought me out of the state of mind that night.|12782
Turns out my dad had removed the firing pin when he inherited the gun.|12782
A couple of years later I overdosed my self with 100 units of my fast acting insulin and a bottle of southern comfort.|12782
Woke up in the hospital and was amazed that it did not work.|12782
I started smoking figuring that would eventually kill me.|12782
Although I am not suicidal anymore I still smoke, knowing it will kill me, so maybe I am suicidal to some small degree?|12782
"As terrible as it sounds, my first thought was 'Why am I still here?'""."|12782
I was puzzled and upset that the shotgun did not go off.|12782
The shell was a either a dud, or older than I thought.|12782
I even checked it to make sure the pin had struck it.|12782
I struggled with depression for a long time after my attempt, but I made it through somehow.|12782
[BK][BK]To this day, it still amazes be that the gun did not fire.|12782
I am happy to be alive today, and I am here if anyone needs to talk about what is going on in their head.|12782
"[BK][BK]Stay strong."""|12782
This will probably get buried so fuck it- first person I saw was my dad and I got pissed off that he was there because we are estranged.|12782
"I think I said something like 'why the hell are YOU here?'"""|12782
After the overdose wore off and I was in the psych unit, I flipped shit at a nurse and slammed my door.|12782
She told me something about who knows what but I was still not all there and thought she was lying to me.|12782
I was livid that I was still alive.|12782
Apologized to her a few days later when I came around.|12782
I was mostly really angry I had failed at killing myself and completely out of it from overdosing and monoxide poisoning.|12782
Here I am, four years later, I still wish I had died but I do not think about killing myself very often anymore.|12782
My life is extremely boring, unfulfilling, and I am pretty resigned from it.|12782
"I am just waiting now. """|12782
"'My mother loves me, what the hell am I doing'""[BK][BK]Id had a huge fight with my mum, and on my newly prescribed medication i just blacked out."|12782
The first thing i remember after asking my mum to leave was sitting on my bed with an empty sleepingpill container.|12782
I have no recollection of conciously deciding to take all those pills, but i remember lying down, feeling a little drowsy and then rushing into the bathroom to try and make myself throw up when the realisation fully hit me.|12782
[BK][BK]My mum took me to the doctors immeditately  (i dont have a gag reflex so i couldnt make myself throw up) and they said the dose i took wasnt lethal, that id just be sleeping for a long time.|12782
[BK]Which i did.|12782
[BK][BK]The stupid thing is that i tried to kill myself multiple times, but the only time i almost succeeded was the time i didnt even conciously really want to.|12782
"[BK][BK][BK]"""|12782
I woke up in a hospital.|12782
At first my mind jumped to: where am I, what is this, what is going on, why cannot i move?|12782
[BK][BK]Then eventually things become less hazy and you put it together that you are in a hospital hooked up to some machines, and nurses going back and forth periodically checking your vitals.|12782
Then you start going over in your head, trying to relive what happened in the hours before and how you got here.|12782
[BK][BK]Did i fall down?|12782
Did i get in an accident?|12782
[BK][BK]Eventually you remember getting home belligerently drunk and running into the bathroom and...that bottle of pills...did i down it?|12782
what was it?|12782
am i fucked?|12782
[BK][BK]And this all took place over a course of several hours, maybe half a day, but you keep coming in an out of consciousness and rare moment of lucidity.|12782
[BK][BK]Eventually you ask where you are, they tell you you are at this hospital.|12782
you might have a phone nearby, you try to let somebody know because you do not know where anybody is.|12782
you are just alone, and afraid, and every moment running scenarios on what the worst case scenario is and for the doctor to wear that grim look.|12782
[BK][BK]eventually you see your family.|12782
that look in your eyes after your parents drove 8 hrs in the middle of the night after getting the call from your roommate....shit.|12782
[BK][BK]edit: funny this question comes up.|12782
anniversary of that night is april 26th, a few weeks from today.|12782
I celebrate that year the same every year, getting as drunk as i can.|12782
expect the same out of it this year|12782
Tried hanging myself with an Ethernet cable from my doorknob.|12782
It did not work and I woke up to my mom trying to open the door screaming.|12782
I was pissed it did not work, and my life took an even worse turn after, which made me consider trying it again.|12782
But by the time I got out of high school, I was over it.|12782
I stopped caring about everything, and because of false accusations by an ex, I was terrified of women.|12782
[BK][BK]I remember walking down the stairs at my university and bumping into a woman I would never met And had a debilitating panic attack because I was so afraid of anything coming from it.|12782
[BK][BK]So I went home with a bunch of prescription pain killers to off myself again, and just before taking them, my dad came in and cried about all of the shit I had to go through, And how much he regrets it all.|12782
[BK][BK]We talked, and I have never tried since.|12782
Nothing in life has ever seemed to be a big enough deal to even consider it.|12782
[BK][BK]Tl;dr, same As everyone, oh shit it did not work.|12782
I was at point in my life where I did not care.|12782
I have 11 unsuccessful suicide attempts already from hanging myself to drinking acid.|12782
There is only one attempt that I walked away from that really left me with something to think about after I woke up.|12782
I ended up waking up in a hospital bed full of machines and I was not strapped down.|12782
I had drank a full months supply of my epilepsy medication.|12782
When I woke up I remembered a few things while I was out.|12782
The feeling of being completely helpless unable to move, talk or breath.|12782
I woke up and my first thought was fuck another failed attempt.|12782
I had doctors surrounding my bed all excited I survived but I just wanted to die|12782
Not sure if this counts, but I had a somewhat intentional heroin overdose last year.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]I was at the bottom of the pit of despair, things could not get any worse, and I had a good amount of heroin on me.|12782
I knew as I was drawing up the shot that it was going to be a big one, but it either did not click in my head, or I just did not care it was most likely going to kill me.|12782
"[BK][BK][BK]I pulled the needle out of my arm, said 'oh fuck'"" and that was it."|12782
I woke up to my friends surrounding me, but I did not fully regain consciousness til about an hour later.|12782
"The first thought I remember was '""I am so glad I am back'"" followed by '""I cannot do this anymore."|12782
"'""[BK][BK][BK]That was my last shot of heroin (9 months ago) and my life has since been fucking great."|12782
I am so grateful for my friends who knew CPR and we are able to bring me back.|12782
"I cannot ever imagine leaving my family behind, and the fact I almost did makes me want to slap myself"""|12782
Most of it was a very irrational haze, the first conscious thought I remember was to immediately call my girlfriend, and tell her I loved her.|12782
I explained what happened and she did not say anything , and just cried.|12782
I was alone at college and I have suffered from PTSD, severe addiction, and Major Depressive Disorder.|12782
This was not my first attempt, but the most serious one.|12782
I just finally got so exhausted, death just seemed like the next logical step.|12782
I had failed at everything in my life and I could not take the shame and guilt of being me anymore.|12782
[BK][BK]I took as many pills as I could.|12782
I picked up a bunch of pain pills and xanax bars.|12782
I took more than I could count.|12782
A girl I had known for two weeks came over to see why I did not come to class.|12782
She found me blacked out on the floor barely alive.|12782
She dragged me to the elevator and managed to get our advisor to drive us across the street to the hospital.|12782
I woke up afterwards wondering how and why I was alive.|12782
I was so angry that I could not get that final release of all the pain.|12782
[BK][BK]She told me that I needed to quit using and try to get better and we could try having a relationship.|12782
I had never been in a relationship before so I had no idea she even liked me.|12782
I went to treatment for the 6th time and we started dating.|12782
[BK][BK]I had never been shown the kindness she gave to me and the unconditional love.|12782
It changed who I was and made me realize that I am not the only person who would be affected by my death.|12782
She is the most beautiful, loving and caring person I have ever met.|12782
[BK][BK]Four years later we are engaged to be married later this year.|12782
I am sober and about to finish up my degree.|12782
Now when I know a friend or relative is depressed I tell them that they could be right around the corner from something life changing.|12782
I cannot say it is been a perfect ride, but my life is better than I could have imagined.|12782
There were a few major hiccups along the way, but I am still here.|12782
I have tried a couple times, the first time I woke up and vomited for what seemed like a week straight and swore I would never try again.. Several years later I attempted again, I vividly remember how scary those last moments of consciousness where and thinking about how I should have said goodbye and that I would never see my loved ones again.|12782
After I woke up, two days later in ICU, I was scared because I did not know where I was, but then I was thankful to have a chance to see my family again.|12782
[BK][BK]I swore after that hospital stay, and the hefty bill that came along with it, I would not attempt again.|12782
It's been 5 years since then.|12782
I would be lying if I said I have not thought about suicide again.|12782
But I always remind myself of those moments before I blacked out, also I think of my brother who found me (we have never talked about it because I am ashamed and I know it deeply hurt him).|12782
I have also started getting involved in the community working with survivors and people affected by suicide.|12782
All of these reasons keep me from attempting again.|12782
There is not a cure and the feelings never fully go away, but you can find things worth living for.|12782
Well I have never had the balls to straight up kill myself but I used to be addicted to heroin for 4 years.|12782
I never consciously tried to overdose but if I just so happened to and died from it well that would have just been alright.|12782
Shit everytime I stuck that needle in my arm I was playing Russian roulette.|12782
Like I said I did not have a death wish but I used to be super depressed and did not feel I had much to live for.|12782
Once I saw the light and knew there was much more to live for I moved on.|12782
Now I can deal with daily life and most emotions I face.|12782
Basic thing is to know you cannot get through anything like this alone.|12782
Help is always there do not be afraid to ask.|12782
I was for 4 years and I could have very well died.|12782
Now I have almost a year clean and life is okay.|12782

"'Wow what the fuck was I thinking?'""[BK]2."|12782
"'""I hope mom does not tell dad'""[BK][BK]I tried to hang myself when i was 12."|12782
I had a lot of trubble in school, I could not concentrate and people called me names, threw food at me during lunch and beat me in the showers after gym class.|12782
[BK]I was just so tired of trying and not knowing what to do.|12782
[BK][BK]But after getting cut down by my mom I sort of snapped back into reality with a whole different perspective.|12782
"[BK]'""If i die, I am just gone."|12782
Everything goes black, i cease to exist.|12782
I lose.|12782

Probably the first bad trip I have had with any kind of drug tbh.|12782
"So no more overdosed pills for me unless it is cyanide."""|12782
"'It''s fucking cold'""."|12782
Middle of winter, tried hanging myself from a tree, woke up lying in the snow with a branch crushing on my chest.|12782
"[BK][BK]Second time was a '""Fuck, why did he have to miss?'"""|12782
as I sobbed into the asphalt of a highway and the driver of the truck came back to pick me up.|12782
"[BK][BK]446 days since then though, and sure it am not good, but it is life."""|12782
"*long drawn out sigh*[BK][BK]'It''s going to be a really long day....And someone took my cigarettes.'"""""|12782
When I was 13, I tried to OD on pills.|12782
My family life was in shambles, my boyfriend (who, looking back on it, was a pretty toxic person) had gone missing, and I was being bullied at school.|12782
"I remember that while the pills were beginning to take effect, my mother and brother were fighting over a school project of his and I  remember thinking 'Can''t I die in peace?'"""|12782
before blacking out.|12782
"When I woke up the next morning, my first thought was '""God dammnit, I cannot even kill myself properly!'"""|12782
My failure had only served to make me more suicidal and I tried two more times before my mother realized how depressed I was and that me being suicidal would be great leverage over my father, so she got me help.|12782
3 years later and I am not really suicidal anymore thanks to medicine, some things my therapist said (but not many), my friends, and various support groups for dealing with my family.|12782
"The thoughts still bug me sometimes, but that is just part of my life. """|12782
First time I tried to hang myself, door broke off what I was trying to hang my self on.. Knocked me out, woke up thinking 'IVE DIED AND IM IM IN MY BEDROOM?!|12782
IS THIS THE AFTERLIFE?'|12782
Then realised due a lack of oxygen and head injury was just making me confused..[BK][BK]Second time many years later threw myself over a bridge at night onto train tracks, hit a post/ pillar in he middle of the tracks, landed on the floor managing to knock myself out.|12782
I was severely injured but survived.|12782
My first thought then was how funny it was I had headphones in, my phone had hit shuffle and 'do not fear the reaper' was playing..|12782
I tried with an old belt tucked into the top of my closet door, I remember visualizing what happened when you die as I was choking, it was a really surreal moment, the blacker it got, the more vivid the image in my mind became, it was really beautiful, I saw clouds.|12782
"the belt snapped just as I was about to fade and I fell to the ground, I felt really sick and the entire room was spinning, I remember looking at a mirror on the wall next to me and thinking, 'is that me?'"""|12782
That was several years ago, I have since have not tried.|12782
"I have found that in every negative situation there is a positive outcome in some form and if you instead focus on that and the fact that it exists it really softens the blow."""|12782
My first thought was probably depression based.|12782
I am an overweight woman and have been trying my entire life to lose weight to stop the bullying and beatings at school.|12782
Now in my adult life, I do cardio, tai-chi, and run at least a mile a day.|12782
No change.|12782
Have had this routine for the past seven months.|12782
ONE pound lost.|12782
Yes this is true and yes I see doctors about this.|12782

What''s the harm?|12782
Just following the majority, like we are taught to do.|12782
[BK][BK]Started attempting suicide when I was nine, around one of the many times my father was raping me, and sorta tried now and again ever since.|12782
Only things that made me stop were when my PTSD triggered flashbacks happened and I froze up.|12782
[BK][BK]My last attempt was April 2nd, 2016.|12782
I failed.|12782
Again.|12782
"[BK][BK]My thought was: 'If there is a god... why does not he let me out of here?'"""""|12782
A day after Christmas last year I found myself extremely desperate to make my life come to an end, so conveniently my parents were out in town and we just happen to own two rifles and some ammunition from when we go shooting at a gun club.|12782
[BK][BK]You can probably see where this is going but yeah I decided to get one of the rifles out and load it with some ammunition.|12782
So I did exactly that and then I put the rifle up under my chin because that was easiest way I found to have it.|12782
I had the gun loaded and the firing pin ready.|12782
[BK][BK]Just as I went to pull the trigger, I had decided I was not going to go through with it and so I went to move my finger away from the trigger but instead actually accidentally pulled the trigger and I was sure that was the end of it.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway lucky for me somehow the bullet got jammed in the barrel because when I loaded it, it managed to go in on a weird angle.|12782
Anyway so that is why I am here still and things are getting a little bit better as they go.|12782
Although I especially feel like a douche for making an attempt on my life on the day after Christmas, let alone doing it at all.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway still here so hurray.|12782
[BK][BK]TL:DR - Loaded gun, realised I did not want to do it, accidentally pulled trigger and luckily the bullet jammed in barrel.|12782
Tried to hang myself at 20.|12782
The last thing I thought before my roommate walked in on me was how horrible it was going to be for my roommate, my friends, my parents, my brother.|12782
Bless the dude's heart though, he literally saved my life, and will always be my best friend.|12782
[BK][BK]Still think about suicide almost every day (26 now) but it is easier to manage with therapy and medication, and I know I will never try it again because that thought about the people who would be affected still chills me to the bone.|12782
I swallowed 66 Ativan during a time when I was homeless for a few days in 2011.|12782
There is a huge list of reasons as to why I did it, but suffice it to say I did it.|12782
[BK][BK][BK][BK]I swallowed them in a super Wal-Mart parking lot in the early afternoon.|12782
I woke up the next day in the hospital feeling like crap.|12782
I turns out I had swallowed them and for some reason in my drug-induced delirium decided it was okay to try and drive somewhere else - I ended up hitting a parked police vehicle that had an officer just sitting inside doing whatever.|12782
I was told the officer said he went up to my window and noticed I was passing in and out of consciousness and he dragged me out of my car and put me in his cruiser and took me to the hospital.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]While there, they pumped my stomach but that was not the end of it.|12782
The nurse told me that I had repeatedly tried opening or smashing open the window on the 3rd floor I was on so I could jump.|12782
I kept screaming something along the lines of, 'I just want to die!|12782
"Just let me die, I do not want to live anymore!'"""|12782
They then handcuffed me to a bed or something.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: Wanted to clarify as I wrote this in the morning when I had just woken up.|12782
When I said I tried to drive somewhere, that is true.|12782
However, I left out that I did not get very far as I hit the parked police car IN the Wal-Mart parking lot.|12782
Furthermore, I was driving slowly enough that there was absolutely no damage to either his police cruiser or my own.|12782
I had to have been going >5 MPH when I hit him as the officer said it was no more than a light bump for himself in the vehicle.|12782
The morning I woke up he and I talked for a few minutes or seconds, the time is very jarbled for me until the day after or so, I just remember him telling me that and then him shaking my hand and hoping I get help.|12782
As to my first thought, I do not remember.|12782
"Just confusion.   """|12782
I was coughing.|12782
Coughing black.|12782
I would tried to light a charcoal fire in my class B RV trailer with no plumbing or electricity that I was behind on rent on and wanted to just die in my sleep from CO poisoning.|12782
My gambling addiction got me to a point where I was going to become homeless and eventually jobless and I was going to die on the streets anyway.|12782
I knew no one would check on me except the landlady or sheriff who would come to throw me out after a few more days.|12782
[BK][BK]I called 911 to Baker Act myself.|12782
You''d think my coughing would be a clue that I needed help.|12782
The operator told me that I could not Baker Act myself, someone had to call and report me, and that my attempt had to meet some threshold of severity before they would send help.|12782
[BK][BK]I learned that help was for others and not for me.|12782
That attempt was over 2 years ago and I still have the cough.|12782
I will probably have it forever.|12782
[BK][BK]That was not the most recent time, but it was the time that affected me the most.|12782

[BK][BK]Put down the book I was studying for a final the next day then very calmly went and hugged my roommate and told her I may have done something pretty stupid.|12782
After that it was a whirlwind of ER and IVs and vomiting and psych ward.|12782
I got of there thinking I will do anything not to go through all of that again.|12782
[BK][BK]Four years later, I am back in college and aiming to finish well this time, have an adorable dog who is the bedrock of my emotional stability, and am in a supportive and healthy relationship with my SO who I had a massive crush on for years and who saw me at my worst those years ago and still wants me (and is wonderfully validating of the progress I have made).|12782
So for all those who replied to this thread who''re still struggling to deal with suicidal ideation and depression and any of that, from someone who is been through all that shit, all the doctors and hospitals, it eventually does start to get better.|12782
Slowly, painfully, but it does.|12782
"Please hang in there, seek help, and keep fighting. """|12782
"My first thought was 'oh shit, I am not done yet.'"""|12782
I tried to overdose on about 400mg of concerta(its an amphetamine like adderall.|12782
The maximum amount someone my body weight should have taken was 150mg.)|12782
I was failing out of school.|12782
My parents made me feel useless and told me that I was never going to achieve anything in my life.|12782
None of my friends understood what I was going through.|12782
As a kid I had all these dreams of things I wanted to do and I here I was just wasting away my life.|12782
[BK][BK]After I took the pills and realized what I had done and I was incredible scchrideI texted all my goodbyes and I waited to die.|12782
I cried and when I got to the point where everything felt hazy and I could not see clearly anymore.|12782
I weeped and it was in that moment that I realized that I did not want to die.|12782
That I was not ready to go yet.|12782
I still had the chance to chase after my dreams and ambitions.|12782
[BK][BK]I became one of the best highschool wrestlers in NYC.|12782
I am currently working on an app to help with depression and suicide.|12782
Got into the colleges of my choice on an almost full ride.|12782
Planning on doing peace corps after college.|12782
"Life is worth living"""|12782
Here's a copy of the post I made two weeks after the attempt:[BK][BK]Two weeks ago I had a kind of good day but for some reason I decided to end it all that Wednesday.|12782
I could not find a reason to go on anymore.|12782
I took the remainder of my previous antidepressants (citalopram) and put all of it in a cup of tea.|12782
Never had I drunk something so disgusting.|12782
I threw up a bit but drank all of the suicide cocktail.|12782
[BK]I felt at peace and became very, very sleepy.|12782
[BK]When I went to lie down on my bed I passed our immediately.|12782
I woke up the next day and it was a pretty fucking good day.|12782
The stupid thing is that it was an ordinary day, there was nothing special about it.|12782
For some reason I was happy again.|12782
[BK][BK]That's it.|12782
Next month is going to be the one-year anniversary.|12782
Honestly?|12782
I guess I was kind of glad in a sense.|12782
As I was swallowing every pill I could get my hands on, I felt sad knowing that if this was the end of me then my best friend would probably never even know I passed & think for so long that we had fallen out or that I hated them.|12782
[BK][BK]Though, realistically, this means my next attempt will likely be coupled with preparation and goodbye notes.|12782
And I would not want to be the person to write something like that only to survive.|12782
I mean...|12782
Bit awkward.|12782
Confusion.|12782
So much confusion.|12782
I woke up behind a maglock door handcuffed to a bed.|12782
That''s all that was in the room.|12782
Me and the bed.|12782
I started crying, asking for help.|12782
A male nurse came in and was very annoyed and kind of rude to me.|12782
[BK][BK] I found out later, I had drank half a bottle of vodka and taken a bunch of painkillers and sleeping pills.|12782
I somehow managed to get myself on a city bus, and get off at the stop at the hospital.|12782
[BK][BK]Apparently I stormed into the ER and collapsed.|12782
Woke up, tried to fight the nurse, police came in, cuffed me, they gave me a sedative and 15 hours later I woke up.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not know if that counts.|12782
I defiantly tried to kill myself.|12782
I should have probably died.|12782
But I did not.|12782
And the first thing I thought was, 'fuck.|12782
"My liver hurts.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]TL;DR: Fucking destroyed my liver with painkillers, sleeping pills and a bunch of vodka.|12782
Woke up in the mental ward.|12782
"Thought to myself '""fuck, my liver hurts.'"""|12782
""""|12782
Downed myself with antidepressants and found myself to be still alive the following morning.|12782
I looked over to my younger brother on the next bed and i broke down silently in bed.|12782
I dont recall how i really felt.|12782
I just cried and got out to shower and attended school.|12782
This had happened several times.|12782
[BK][BK]My mother passed away 13 years ago and my dad and stepmother divorced after five years of marriage.|12782
My dad was not the father figure he was supposed to be; abandoning us to ourselves in the house whilst he had to deal with his own issues.|12782
"I created a strong bond with my younger brother and thinking back, i am glad i hadnt 'tried harder'""."|12782
Ive been off meds for over four years now and my brother has been doing good in school and is now in the rugby team.|12782
I wouldnt deny that what i did was selfish.|12782
But what i would like to point out is suicide always seems to be the easist way out.|12782
As much as your friends or society tells us that suicide is never the solution, when youre in a dark place and youre suffocating,  tearing up the wound wide open big enough to numb it seems to be the only option.|12782
My heart goes out to suicide victims and survivors.|12782
"There is no way to tell if it is the right or wrong thing to do."""|12782
Freshman year of college I punched out a window and crawled out onto a 12th story ledge of a dorm.|12782
"I sat on that ledge for three hours, when I finally went back in to the waiting arms of the first responders and they sat me down to bandage my shredded arm was, 'fuck, I am gonna be '""that kid'"" from now on."|12782
"Second thought was '""fuck, I was supposed to go duck hunting on Saturday, now I will not get to own a gun'"" it is funny."|12782
I do not remember very much of when I was on the ledge.|12782
Just a view like picture memories, no dialogues.|12782
I remember thinking that I had a hell of a view, and a voice inside yelling jump.|12782
I get a weird feeling every time I drive past that dorm, but I always get proud that I went back to school.|12782
"Don''t feel like that kid now though, also I fuckin love all my Guns. """|12782
dad found out i was taking like 20 ambien and like a bottle of valium and it was too late and i passed the fuck out when the ambulance came but i didnt do shit other then make me feel like shit for the next 3 days... my parents didnt even say anything to me after that... asked to see a tharapist but it never happened lmao if i die at 18 i just know i was a huge burden on my whole family and they all hate me for being a fucking loser... tried so many times after that with even more ambien and benzos but now i know it will never kill me but its all i have and im too much of a pussy to slit my wrists... fuck cutting yourself i have too many scars that will never go away|12782
This happened May of last year.|12782
"At first I thought 'Crap I survived and my bill is going to be off the roof'""."|12782
Luckily I had my health insurance to cover 80%.|12782
But I also realized what I had just put my family, friends, and my partner at the time through.|12782
I was looking for a quick way out; I did not want to deal with the pain or consequences that had just recently occurred.|12782
Looking back now I realized that was not the answer.|12782
Even now I sometimes struggle keeping those thoughts from entering my mind or letting them control me.|12782
I have so much to live for and now that I am a uncle to my 3 month old nephew I have to keep pushing myself and telling myself that I am worth it.|12782
I have people around me who love and support me.|12782
"It''s easier said than done however I have survived and I will continue to survive. """|12782
As i was laying in some sewer gutter over looking a freeway, my mind and body were shutting down already in and out of consciousness, i looked down at my arm gushing with blood, i remembered my little sisters (8yrs old) face before I left the house earlier that day,  she was telling me how she wanted to play outside with me.|12782
I remember thinking of her and telling myself i have to wake up and stop the bleeding somehow... the place i was at was on a trail behind a park, i started to drag myself towards the park with blood gushing down my arm i do not know how but i manged to tie a tall grass around my upper bicep to slow the bleeding, drank a lot of water at the fountain and washed the blood from my arms so i can make it home without anyone knowing what was going on.|12782
[BK] I never went to the hospital, parents never found out,  they asked about my cut though about a month after on a day when i wore a tank top and that is the first thing they noticed.|12782
i still have a scar, i cut myself on my bicep right where the vein is, that no one knows how it got there, except for you guys first time telling anyone about this.|12782
Whenever i am in my dark place i try to think of the reason why i stopped myself that day.|12782
As depressing at these stories are, the most depressing fact is how many responses there are.|12782
Nothing is worth your life.|12782
I, or a professional (probably the better option) am here to talk to any of you if you need it.|12782
"Tl;dr: 'A wordless, seething shame, '"" as another user in this thread so accurately and eloquently described."|12782
[BK][BK]To keep backgrounds short, I was a high-schooler facing neglect by my parents.|12782
My main supports were my friends, who I would kept since elementary school (a few of which are still my closest friends to this day.)|12782
These people, who had kept me around at my best and worse times when others would not, became the family I did not have at home.|12782
[BK][BK]I had a very specific suicide plan in place.|12782
I planned to OD on my sleeping meds at school an hour before lunch (since it took an hour and a half for my normal doses to kick in) so that I would be able to spend my last bit of time with my friends (my *family*.)|12782
I would then break away during lunch to walk a nearby path that led to a rock overlooking the Penobscot river.|12782
That was where I planned on peacefully falling asleep and dying.|12782
[BK][BK]I am sure anybody even marginally smarter than I was is able to see the flaws in my plan.|12782
[BK][BK]To keep things basic, medications do not work that way.|12782
I OD''d when I would planned to, but having taken 16 times my average dose, it only took about 15 minutes for the effects to kick in as opposed to the hour and a half I had been expecting.. and there is not a peaceful fucking thing about overdosing.|12782
[BK][BK]I was in the middle of English class, my last class before lunch, when I began to feel the effects of my overdose.|12782
I tried playing it off, believing I could make it the last half an hour.|12782
I thought I had been maintaining composure well enough to appear fine, but the people around me kept looking at me and asking me if I was okay.|12782
I felt light-headed, nauseous, and was weak to the point where it was hard to lift my head.|12782
That''s when I became scared.|12782
[BK][BK]I felt like absolute shit.|12782
I could hardly move, but felt extremely nauseous.|12782
I knew I would be laying on my desk, in the middle of class, soaked in my own sick very soon.|12782
I would OD''d to chase away the pain, not to find myself humiliated and scared in the middle of a room filled with people, the majority of which I hardly knew.|12782
I am not sure I regretted wanting to die, but I surely regretted the details.|12782
[BK][BK]I remember interrupting the teacher mid-lecture, slurring that I needed to go to the nurse''s office before stumbling out of the room and puking in the middle of the hallway.|12782
I remember crying, knowing everyone I would left behind in class knew I was fucked up.|12782
Everything is hazy afterwards, but I eventually found myself waiting for an ambulance on a cot in the nurse''s office, with the school officer and my mother both present.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not remember feeling disappointed or grateful for being alive - all I can remember is the overwhelming shame that I felt.|12782
[BK][BK]My mother stared at me for awhile without saying a word.|12782
The officer left the room for a moment, and I took the opportunity to ask her what she was thinking.|12782
Looking straight into my eyes, the one sentence she spared me was to let me know how disappointed she was in me.|12782
In that moment, I wished I could have been given a do-over.|12782
I doubt that is a memory that will ever stop hurting.|12782
"I wish I could say that I had some big '""aha!'"""|12782
moment in this, but unless we are talking about the realization that my mother is a huge ass, it just was not there.|12782
[BK][BK]To anybody who may be reading my post and feeling suicidal - do not be discouraged by this.|12782
There may not have been a huge life-changing epiphany for me in the experience, however, it is been five years and I am still alive.|12782
This only proves that the big learning moments come through trying to live, not trying to die.|12782
When you are at your lowest is when you have got to work your hardest.|12782
Know that you **CAN** do it,  you **ARE** worth it, and that finding happiness **IS** possible.|12782
It''s been five years for me, and honestly I still feel bad just as often as I feel good, but even so, I am so proud of myself.|12782
I have worked hard every day, and even though I have slipped and fallen back into old habits during my journey, I still know that I am capable of progressing towards something better than what I am now.|12782
Anyone and everyone is, but it is on the individual to take those hard and rewarding steps.|12782
If you cannot do it yourself, remember to seek out professional help, or at the very least support from your loved ones.|12782
[BK][BK]If anybody needs a listening ear or would like some advice, please feel free to message me.|12782
You deserve to be heard and I would be just fine being the person to listen.|12782
I am sure many people here would.|12782
"Stay strong. """|12782
I tried to strangle myself with a belt, it did not even knock me unconscious.|12782
It just made me dizzy and made my throat hurt.|12782
[BK][BK]My first thought was how pathetic I was for not even being able to kill myself.|12782
I was on my bed so I just went to sleep straight after and started planning and researching a better way to do it with what little means I had.|12782
[BK][BK]I have only really tried once after that and my sister caught me before I could do any real damage the second time.|12782
That time I was just kinda thinking about how I was surprised everyone reacted to my goodbye message.|12782
I figured no one would care or were not close enough to care, but even people I hardly spoke to showed concern.|12782
I felt guilty.|12782
Right as I blacked out, I heard screaming.|12782
My roommate had walked in I guess.|12782
We were in a behavioral ward and so we were fucked up anyways but it really really messed with her.|12782
It sent her into a meltdown, which is understandable when you walk in to see your roomie hanging from her sandal straps.|12782
[BK][BK]When I got resuscitated or whatever, she was the first thing I thought of.|12782
[BK][BK]That was my 2nd attempt before I was 16.|12782
I did not stop trying until I was around 20...|12782
But I am really happy I was in a place that saved me.|12782
I had tied myself and moved the bed so there really was no backing out.If they had not cut me down, I would not be here.|12782
Which I guess I would not mind.|12782
I am apathetic towards death still.|12782
[BK][BK]And at 24, i love my life.|12782
I never thought I would.|12782
I still think About it sometimes.|12782
I am bipolar so...|12782
Nothing's ever super easy.|12782
But..|12782
I do not even cut anymore, even though i miss it and consider it sometimes.|12782
I really like myself now though.|12782
I guess that is the difference [BK][BK]Edit: reflecting on this has now made me incredibly sad...|12782
"My first thought was 'Oh fuck, dad is gonna hate me'""."|12782
It was when I woke up in the hospital after getting my stomach pumped, I decided downing as much sleep aid as humanly possible and washing it down with whiskey at the age of 15.|12782
I woke up to my father asleep in the chair next to my hospital bed.|12782
I just started sobbing when I saw how much he would been worrying, and how both he and my mother thought it was their fault.|12782
It was after that I decided to start taking my life seriously, not just for me, but the people around me too.|12782
[BK][BK]Apparently they found me in the bathroom, In a pool of my own piss, vomit, and shit.|12782
"Took weeks to Scrub it all out of my hair. """|12782
'I am alive, are not I?|12782

My ex boyfriend called the ambulance when I told him my goodbyes.|12782
I did not expect to fail, my family found out from the ambulance and I did not get to try again.|12782
I got help after .|12782
"It took a lot of work to feel '""ok'"" , but I got there."|12782
Every so often something special happens, whether it is seeing something beautiful like the ocean or having a special moment with someone.|12782
"I then think to myself...[BK][BK]'""I am so happy I did not miss this.'"""""|12782
That I was scared shitless because I would not really thought of what next.|12782
There was not supposed to be a what next.|12782
[BK][BK]/I have MS, and for a long time had spasms that were... beyond violent.|12782
Put holes in plaster and drywall kind of violent.|12782
Broken foot in the middle of the night because I kicked the shit out of the wall violent.|12782
"Diazepam, in sufficient quantity, stopped the spasms... but I greatly disliked how 'out of it'"" it made me feel... so I decided one day to stop taking it."|12782
I do not remember much of the next day or two, but apparently I tried to OD.|12782
[BK][BK]The worst part was, until 3 days later, when they finally had managed to get in touch with my b/f and my doctors office, they withheld all of my MS drugs.|12782
Shit was out of control bad, and they were convinced I was just withdrawing from something... nobody believed that I could have MS...|12782
"I mean, I guess to them it seemed totally impossible that someone could both have MS and be depressed."""|12782
'I am choking.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]There was an NG (Nasogastric) tube going through my nose and into my throat."|12782
My first response was to pull it out since I thought I was choking on it.|12782
I quickly found out that I was restrained with very limited mobility, so I tried to sit up.|12782
My forehead was also tied down, so I arched my neck and back until the restraint slipped.|12782
Then I bent myself double and pulled the tube out slowly.|12782
[BK][BK]I would been catatonic fit about a day and a half.|12782
The lights were on (body) but nobody was home.|12782
[BK][BK]I would been extraordinarily violent while catatonic, and extremely harmful to myself.|12782
I still have scars where I ripped the IV out of my right arm.|12782
My parents thought I would become a vegetable...|12782
"I cannot imagine the stress it put on them."""|12782
After my 10th suicide attempt and being brought back multiple times I finally realized I was not meant to die.|12782
After spending so much time in and out of psych wards trying to end my life I realized I had things left to do on this planet so Id better figure out how to make my life bearable because it was not my time yet.|12782
I made a plan to actually leave my abusive situation and poured my energy into that instead.|12782
I was not meant to die so Id better figure out how to live and make it kickass.|12782
I took suicide off the table.|12782
That was not an option anymore.|12782
I have not looked back since.|12782
Life has been shitty and really difficult but im a survivor in every sense of the word.|12782
I know whatever life throws at me I will be okay.|12782
People have tried to destroy me, I have tried to destroy me and life has done its damn best but it am not happening.|12782
Im a resilient motherfucker.|12782
When I became conscious I woke up to a burning sensation in my face.|12782
I had tried to hang myself and I guess all of the blood was rushing back into my face.|12782
At first I was really disoriented forgetting why I was laying on the floor.|12782
When I sat up with a wire still around my neck I realized what I had done and when I looked up I saw the cabinet I had been hanging from was completely ripped off the wall.|12782
"My first thought was 'How could I have really gone through with it?'"""|12782
Suicide was always on my mind but I never really thought I could go through with it.|12782
I instantly started crying and sat there crying for a good 30 min.|12782
"After that I just thought of how horrible it would have been for my family and friends and said I would never try something like that again. """|12782
"I saw a post today that said, 'suicide does not end the pain, it passes it on to someone else.'"""|12782
[BK]I have never tried to kill myself.|12782
I have wanted to but knew I could not.|12782
I know that when all those thoughts are racing through your mind, this is one of the last things you you will be thinking about.|12782
But it is such a strong sentence.|12782
[BK]I lost a classmate to suicide- a few classmates actually.|12782
And I have friends and family who have tried committing suicide.|12782
[BK]If this quote can help at least one person, then it makes a difference.|12782

I tried twice.|12782
[BK][BK]First time knife broke, which was just ridiculous.|12782
[BK][BK]Second time I tried to OD on 6 mg of xanax, a bottle of vodka, two 40 oz, a bottle of wine, three games of weed, and 2 grams of ketamine.|12782
[BK][BK]Woke up the next morning without even a hangover.|12782
[BK][BK]That was when I realized I am not going to get to kill myself.|12782
Then I thought, that maybe, just maybe, I was supposed to do something.|12782
[BK][BK]I am trying to figure that out still, but I have done a lot of interesting things since.|12782
[BK][BK]Gone to rehab and gotten clean, gone to Israel and taught English to Bedouins, moved to the middle east for good.|12782
[BK][BK]It was a few years after the suicide attempts I received a huge head injury and my depression more or less dissapated.|12782
The first time I tried to jump in front of a car.|12782
I jumped too early and they missed by inches.|12782
"I thought, 'Aw, dammit!'"""|12782
I think I was in 2nd grade.|12782

"A stranger pulled me out before I blacked out from holding my breath and my first thought was also my first words, '""Fuck you!'""."|12782
[BK][BK]Both time I guess my first thought was an angry thought that expressed my anger towards being so shit at life I could not even kill myself, and anger towards the people around me who just could not let it happen.|12782
[BK][BK]The last time was in college and I tried to OD on acetaminophen but ended up throwing the pills up.|12782
This was right after my sister had tried to cut her wrists and I was having an incredibly hard time working through the trauma of being the one who found her in the bathroom all bloody.|12782
"My first thought was, '""Not doing it that way again.'"""|12782
because it fucking sucked.|12782
[BK][BK]I have not told anyone in my family or group of friends about that last one, and I probably will not.|12782
Not because I am done trying to kill myself, but because I finally found a good way to do it and it is kind of comforting knowing I have a good way out if I ever really cannot go on anymore.|12782
"It''s kinda peaceful thinking about it."""|12782
I was 15.|12782
Coming near the end of my sophomore year of high school.|12782
It was 3:45 am.|12782
I had went down into the basement of my father house where the fun safe was located.|12782
My father taught me the combination in case of any emergencies in which I would need a gun to protect myself or the house, or grab important documents from it in the event of some disaster.|12782
[BK][BK]I grabbed the first pistol I saw, a colt .45 that was my grandfathers.|12782
Now we kept a separate ammo can but in the safe was a blue box of old ammunition for the pistol of my choice.|12782
I inserted a single round into the chamber and closed the bolt.|12782
[BK][BK]The next 10 seconds felt like years.|12782
It seemed as if time slowed down or even came to a complete stop around me, as if I was the only one not affected by it.|12782
Any and all sounds and bent noose just ceased.|12782
[BK][BK]All of that was just the 10 seconds it took for me to put the gun to my right temple and pull the trigger, hoping for nothingness.|12782
[BK][BK]All I heard was a click.|12782
I pulled back the bolt and the round came out.|12782
I checked the back of it only to see a dent from the firing pin in the primer.|12782
[BK][BK]I just broke down in that moment.|12782
I was crying on the floor for about an hour until I realized my dad would be getting up soon for work.|12782
I went back to my room and laid in my bed, only able to think about what had just happened.|12782
I went to school the next morning as if nothing happened.|12782
[BK][BK]It's now been almost 3 years since that.|12782
I am now 18 going on 19 in a couple months.|12782
I am now a college student or was.|12782
I was recently put in a psychiatric ward because the first appointment I ever made with a counselor in an attempt to finally get help, led  to the fear of me killing myself again.|12782
[BK][BK]I am now on medication.|12782
Not really doing better so I am going to ask my doctor about trying different medication.|12782
I have moved back home to go to community college and work while I get things in my life sorted out.|12782
[BK][BK]Not a day goes by where I do not think about me shooting myself 3 years ago.|12782
My first thought was that I would never do it again; putting my family in that position was far too horrific for me.|12782
[BK][BK]And then I attempted again.|12782
And again.|12782
I am at 15 times total.|12782
Been in and out of mental hospitals throughout my life.|12782
[BK][BK]I am finally on my feet and feeling better but goddamn if I am not worried I will go back there again.|12782
[BK][BK]Being autistic and trans is hard.|12782
I am so isolated.|12782
Everyone thinks I am weird.|12782
I do not understand people, sometimes I feel like people just tolerate me and want me to go away.|12782
[BK][BK]It's dealing with all that that makes me worry that I will go for a 16th attempt, but I hope not.|12782
:/|12782
To be honest, I do not remember.|12782
I lost about a week of my life.|12782
I somehow moved down the road to my friend's house and fell asleep in my friend's bed, and he checked every few hours to make sure I was still breathing.|12782
I think I just slept for most of that week, I just completely shut down.|12782
It's just a big huge black space in my life.|12782
My friends called an anonymous couple or something and two people came down to talk to me, and they talked me into checking myself into the hospital.|12782
[BK][BK]Best decision of my life.|12782
Mostly annoyed.|12782
The gun just refused to go off, both with freshly reloaded rounds, and factory loads.|12782
I got pissed off and chucked the shotgun under my bed and took a nap.|12782
Went to the range later on with my dad, and did not miss a single shot with the same rounds that refused to kill me.|12782
That was the last honest attempt I made, about 7 years ago.|12782
I have had the thought about once a month, and came really damn close about two years ago, but I learned from my dad growing up that all a man has is his word, and I gave my word to too many people to try again.|12782
So I just sit here and suffer while people try to cheer me up or ask what is going on.|12782
How the fuck am I still here...quickly followed how the fuck did I just do something so selfish|12782
I stopped halfway through my attempt because I panicked and was not sure about it.|12782
My first thought was that I could not stand the thought of leaving my dog alone.|12782
[BK][BK]I told my mom and she was annoyed that I needed to go to the hospital on a school night.|12782
When we got there and the doctors rushed me in, then she started to cry about being a bad mom and I had to console her all night.|12782
The doctors consoled her as well.|12782
She persuaded me to say it was an accident and they let me go without any follow up.|12782
[BK][BK]The next week I tried sleeping pills but an ambiguous amount - sort of like Russian roulette with pills.|12782
Obviously it was not enough but I did not tell anyone that time.|12782
When I was 22 I tried to end my life.|12782
It was a very dark time in my life and I had recently reached out to a woman that I loved and she talked to me and, to make a long story short she came to my home and left as promptly as she showed which really put me in a bad state of mind.|12782
I attempted to use a S&W .40 M&P edition.|12782
If anyone here knows about this weapon is that it is safety is on the trigger and not one that has to be actively be engaged or disengaged.|12782
When I tried to pull the trigger, my finger was too high in the trigger well and the gun did not go off, thank god.|12782
I dropped it and laid in my bed and thought about how that moment would have effected everyone that I knew and loved me and I just could not do that to them, so I sold my gun.|12782
[BK][BK]Now, I am happily married(to that woman, yes) and have two wonderful dogs that I care the world for and have a great support system here in my home.|12782
It's still hard to talk about my depression and it still sticks with me, but I fight it tooth and nail every day.|12782
I am glad I survived and I am more than happy to tell others out there dealing with the same pain that I had... that it is OK. You are a wonderful person and there are things meant for you out there.|12782
Don't let those thoughts slip into your mind and change your patterns.|12782
Don't let your depression control you; I did and I am ashamed I ever let it happen.|12782
Read this and learn from it, know that taking your life is not the answer.|12782
[BK][BK]If any of you read this and need help, message me here.|12782
I might not respond right away but I will talk to you if you feel you have nowhere else to go.|12782
"'Fuck.'"""""|12782
Maybe this dosent count as much as others, but I had the noose set up and everything, and just as I was about to kick out my desk chair from under me, I saw (yeah this it totally ridiculous) a ticket stub from a football match I went to.|12782
I just thought 'well, that was a fun time.|12782
"Maybe there are things I could live for'""."|12782
Took down the noose and went back to bed.|12782
It''s only been on the up and up from there, thankfully.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: fuck, this brings back a lot of memories.|12782
I thought I would add a little more.|12782
I had everything laid out (note that left my PC to my best friend, my magic the gathering stuff to a friend who was in to the game, whatever cash I had at the time to a local homeless charity, asking my parents/whoever found me to move on swiftly from what happened, etc) and I just sort of decided to not do it.|12782
It''s all surreal and the memories from the 2 or so years I was suicidal a lot of the time are just sort of a blur (this was nearly 2 years ago when I sort of came out of it), so I do not remember much else from the time.|12782
I have gotten more involved in volunteer work and stuff which helps a lot.|12782
My honest advice is to go get help.|12782
I was helped out a lot by free counseling/therapy sessions thanks to nationalised healthcare in the UK, but if you do not have the luxury of universal healthcare/money for therapy then there are a million and one ways to get out of it.|12782
"If anyone''s needing some help or advice feel free to PM me."""|12782
Again, again, again.|12782
Need to try again.|12782
So I did.|12782
I was in shock.|12782
I had broken many bones in my face and my hip, blood was gushing down my face.|12782
I remember the feeling of falling and how it seemed to happen so fast.|12782
But once you hurt yourself that bad it overrides any other thought and you immediately think about getting to a hospital.|12782
[BK][BK]Now, I think about how it actually could have killed me or paralyzed me.|12782
I do not remember any exact thoughts, just a general sense of confusion.|12782
And a massive pain in my head.|12782
I was 15, tried to hang myself with bedsheets and TL;DR my half-assed noose came undone after I passed out, I fell, and smacked my head really fucking hard.|12782
Wouldn't suicide failures be a better term?|12782
I went for liver damage.|12782
I am talking acetaminophen and booze.|12782
"I was going shot for pill when a girl I was sort of seeing at the time was invited over by my roommate (we were all old high school friends) and she bursted into my room with a big old 'It''s great to see you because this is probably going to be the start of  a significant relationship between us!'"""|12782
Grin on her face.|12782
I obviously stopped trying to poison myself because I was now entertaining a guest.|12782
"I was new to alcohol at the time and I felt woozy. """|12782
I hated myself.|12782
I was such a failure at life that I could not even die correctly.|12782
After I left my note where it would have been found, I was weighed down with regret and embarrassment.|12782
I had to face everyone after the stunt I pulled.|12782
Once I was allowed to have visitors, my parents were the first to see me.|12782
I could not even say a word before they both had their arms around me, crying.|12782
Every negative emotion I had at that moment washed away.|12782
I felt the sincerity in the way they held me.|12782
I felt loved.|12782
I still battle my depression.|12782
It's even gotten crippling as of recently.|12782
But as long as at least one person loves me the way my parents do, I know I am not completely alone.|12782
'This is not me.|12782
I do not do these things.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]The morning after a party where I took a bottle of whiskey,  wearing only indoor clothes,  ventured around and drank,  sobbing about a woman I loved but who never loved me back."|12782
Ended up sleeping in snow for an hour and half, was later found by classmates at the party who brought me back inside,  put me down at sauna room with blankets and pillows.|12782
I am quite grateful to those lads.|12782
I never have mentioned anyone why I went out like that,  but I just wished to freeze to death.|12782
"All they know is that I just got real drunk and went out for a cigarette,  fell and was too wasted to make it back. """|12782
I do not know why but after going through severe depression with no treatment I have become exceptionally angry towards other suicidal people.|12782
[BK][BK]Like, I never explicitly tried to kill myself I just put myself into increasingly dangerous situations where I hoped I would die.|12782
I got into super bad longboard accidents, got hit by a car, got physically harmed in some way, but the next thought was always *I can do better*.|12782
[BK][BK]For some reason I never think about killing myself any more - it is always about getting myself killed.|12782
[BK][BK]A year ago?|12782
I thought about killing myself all the time.|12782
Daily, multiple times.|12782
I had several plans for how I would do it, but I was too scared of pain to go through.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not know why I am different now - I have never seen a therapist or gotten pills, I guess it is just like the end is in sight.|12782
First time (age 13): 'I lived through this, so I guess that means I am alive for a reason.|12782
I am going to make a commitment to life.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Second time (age 16): I told my friend after overdosing and she convinced me to go to the hospital."|12782
"My first thought was, '""She wants me to live so I guess I will stick around.'"""|12782
I put way too much importance on her friendship and her opinion of me.|12782
(I was in love with her and I am female and she was very homophobic, it was a messed up situation that contributed to my being suicidal.)|12782
"[BK][BK]Third and final attempt (age 16): '""Fuck!"|12782
I am still alive.|12782
I need to die ASAP.|12782
"I am going to leave the hospital and go lie down on the train tracks.'"""|12782
Thank Goodness, two security guards physically restrained me from leaving.|12782
[BK][BK]Update on my life: I am 32 now and am very grateful to be alive.|12782
I have had many good times since those suicidal days of my teens, and bad  times too.|12782
Lately I have been going through a painful time.|12782
But through it all I stay grateful to be alive.|12782
The most important thing is I have found meaning in my life, a commitment and desire to try to make the world a better place, and use my life for that purpose.|12782
This keeps me with a strong will to live even when there is pain.|12782
"[BK][BK]"""|12782
Hi,[BK][BK]I know many will not even read this, but I just want you to know that no matter how low a point in your life you think you are, there will always be someone willing to listen to you, talk to you, care for you.|12782
I want you all to know that I really love you, and am here for you to talk to, a non-judgmental faceless individual over the internet, probably continents away.|12782
I will most likely never see your face, and you mine, but I want to talk to you.|12782
I want to know your story.|12782
[BK][BK]I love you.|12782
Talk to me.|12782
I remember this very clearly.|12782
I yelled this aloud.|12782
[BK][BK]'Jesus fucking christ are you FUCKING KIDDING ME?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Was mad more than anything."|12782
Still alive.|12782
Not the outcome I wanted.|12782
That day I did not have anything better to do so I just went to the gym.|12782
Then I went the next day.|12782
And the day after that, and I just did not stop.|12782
Now I am in peak physical condition and I am better than I have ever been at MMA.|12782
[BK][BK]I guess the moral of the story is you have to make change happen.|12782
Your life will not just magically get better.|12782
"The '""it gets better'"" thing is bullshit."|12782
It will not get better if you sit around doing nothing.|12782
"Make it better and live happier because of it."""|12782
Interesting thread.|12782
I have been thinking about suicide often lately, usually every day.|12782
I just cannot shake the thought of it.|12782
But I also do not really know how to do it - no high buildings in my area, not an easy access to guns, not a huge amount of pills availabe.|12782
I am really scared of being in pain during or after it - if I survive.|12782
[BK][BK]So I probably will have to live with this for a while...[BK][BK]I wanted to write something at /depression or another sub, but I just do not have the energy to do so.|12782
*'No!|12782
No!|12782
Shit!|12782
Fuck!|12782
How am I going to explain this?|12782
"'""*[BK][BK]A few seconds later my father and brother walked in and found me looking bewildered sitting next to the ceiling fan and tiles on the floor."|12782
[BK][BK]I promised I was only kidding.|12782
"And that was more than 15 years ago, but I still get random calls at 2am or 3am just to make sure I am okay and not doing anything stupid. """|12782
I cried.|12782
I am bipolar, and I could not remember the feeling of emptiness.|12782
At the time I could not understand why I could not remember the emotion, I had the memories of the experience but I could not remember the feeling.|12782
So I cried.|12782
Why the fuck did not it work?|12782
Do i really have to put up with this all again?|12782
It's gonna be even worse now because I failed.|12782
I kept trying to find a way out as soon as possible.|12782
Hell, even years later I am still in the same boat.|12782
There's nothing i can do about it, i just do not care about my life anymore.|12782
"'Goddammit i cant do anything right!!!'"""|12782
Right after i ran my car doing about 80mph into what i thought was a wall.|12782
Turned out i missed the wall and hit a grass embankment next to it, jumped my car almost 100ft, through a telephone post and landed on some guys fence in a field.|12782
"I had told myself '""self, if this doesnt work then theres no reason for you to try again, you will die of natural or unnatural causes when its time for you to'"". """|12782
Late in the party, but here is my answer: I do not remember.|12782
[BK][BK]I never used to have feelings back in those days.|12782
If I had, I would have never decided to leave my parents to deal with my dead body.|12782
[BK][BK]However, I am thankful that I survived, because my suicide note was embarassingly cringeworthy :-P|12782
Relief, disappointment, and extreme fear.|12782
I wanted it to end so badly, but felt like I was too much of a pussy to do it.|12782
Now I realize that I was just having a bit of common sense.|12782
I am trying to find things to live for now, still having a bit of difficulty.|12782
Not sure if this question quite applies to me.|12782
I never lost consciousness - my attempt was more missguided than anything else, and the method I chose would not have instantly killed me like I intended.|12782
Rather, the pills that I swallowed would have destroyed my kidneys, and would have killed me slowly over the next few months.|12782
So I did not really lose consciousness; I just swallowed a bunch of pills, washed them down with some gatorade, wandered around campus for a while, came back to my dorm, wrote a suicide note, and then called 911 on myself.|12782
"[BK][BK]I guess what I realized over those few hours was 'I want to live,'"" or alternatively, '""I am afraid to die."|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Either way, here I am."""|12782
Mostly variations on the theme of 'Son of a bitch!|12782
"'""[BK][BK]After I finished raging at life for being so awful that it would not even end, I resigned myself to what I called '""Plan B,'"" which was a much more brutal combination of a bunch of different ways of killing myself."|12782
Realistically, now that I am older and not (as much of) an idiot, I realize that the only part of Plan B that might have even been remotely effective at killing a human is that it was to be done in a garage with a running car.|12782
God, what a stupid plan.|12782
[BK][BK]Thankfully, my confidence that Plan B would work made me reckless about keeping my damn mouth shut, and I told a couple of friends about it.|12782
They talked to me for hours and eventually convinced me to *not* kill myself.|12782
Instead, I just acted like an emo little shit for the next...geez, six months?|12782
Eight?|12782
Something like that.|12782
I nearly married the girl that helped bring me out of it.|12782
[BK][BK]Somebody else in here was talking about what they would say to that version of themselves.|12782
"Pretty sure I would start with '""Listen, asshole.'"""|12782
"I am not going to unilaterally say anything about people who attempt suicide, but in *my* case, a severe dose of '""You''re 17 and you do not know shit about shit'"" perspective was in order."""|12782
After a general wash of 'What?/Where am I?/Did it work?|12782
"'"", the first thing I remember thinking clearly was '""Jesus Christ, I am so much of a fuckup I cannot even kill myself right.'"""|12782
""""|12782
"my first thought was: 'oh fuck, moms going to be pissed.'"""|12782
I had jumped from a tree and instead of dying like I had proposed to do, I only ended up breaking my wrist on impact.|12782
I overestimated the height of the tree.|12782
She brought me to the hospital and was not mad at all actually.|12782
My mom never knew what happened.|12782
I just told her I had fallen off the tree accidentally.|12782
I was 14, which was 2 years ago.|12782
"My 16th birthday is in the first week of May and I still hate myself with every passing day. """|12782
I was 15 and surrounded by people who people I now know were temporary.|12782
I was being bullied by a group of the aforementioned people and a couple of teachers simultaneously.|12782
I am not going into what the kids did to me, but the teachers took it further than they ever did.|12782
"I have suffered from panic attacks since I was 10 years old and whenever I got jittery the teachers would pick up on it and make me feel bad for 'putting it on'""."|12782
During a food tech trip with (fortunately) 2 other students, I had a panic attack, and instead of being remotely reassuring, I was left by the minibus alone.|12782
I went home after, I took as many painkillers as I could,and sat on my kitchen floor.|12782
I do not remember much but I know my mum called 999 and I had to stay in hospital overnight.|12782
My first thought was anger as to why I had not died there and then.|12782
"It''s been a few years since then, and i cannot say I feel any better."""|12782
Why cannot people just let me stop hurting?|12782
[BK][BK]I was driving my sister and I to school, and planned to drop her off, then drive away to find a secluded place to die.|12782
I did not have a lot of options, and did not really plan it out, but I brought a bottle of caffeine pills with a combined total of about 8g of caffeine.|12782
I am not positive in hindsight that it had be enough, but I did not care at the time.|12782
[BK][BK]Well, my sister pieced things together.|12782
She refused to get out of the car, and called my parents, who called the police.|12782
I ended up getting pulled over on the highway, so I got out of the car and managed to down most of the bottle before I was tackled and arrested.|12782
As I got hauled into the ambulance, I turned to my parents and asked them that first thought.|12782
I think that moment was the first step to recovering, after seeing how much that one sentence hurt them, and how much they cared.|12782
[BK][BK]I spent the next two weeks in the psych ward before being released on the condition that I continue medication and therapy.|12782
That was 8 years ago, and in that time, I learned the answer to that question: because people care.|12782
They cared enough to help me see that there are other options.|12782
I am not quite 'there' yet, but I have met some amazing people, one in particular, that I do not want to lose.|12782
I may still hurt, but it is a small price to pay to wake up to his face every day.|12782
[BK][BK]Wow, that got lovey dovey, did not it?|12782
I guess, when looking back on those intensely emotional events, the good comes out alongside, right?|12782
'Cold cold cold cold cold.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I had pretty much given up, and was alone in my apartment."|12782
It was winter and I turned off the heat, only put on one blanket, and figured I would drift off and hypothermia would get me.|12782
[BK][BK]My vision got unfocused and eventually whited out, my hearing went away, and I went into a state I can only call oblivion.|12782
The best sense my mind can make is that it was like going on the opposite direction as sleep.|12782
[BK][BK]The next thing I knew, I was in my shower.|12782
The image of my hands in front of me, as I regained consciousness, is still seared into my mind.|12782
Then I got sensations back in my body.|12782
I was freezing as the water warmed me back up.|12782
My insides were ice, and the warmth of the water on my skin was almost painful.|12782
"[BK][BK]I moved out of that place soon after. """|12782
My first time was when I was about 15.|12782
I had found two random pills at my house (both of my parents take anti psychotics) and I thought it would be strong enough to kill me, so after lunch one day I sat on the Oval and took both of them and just lied there smoking until I passed out and then woke up to the sound of the bell and got up and walked home.|12782
"My first thought was 'shit, I have to go home'""."|12782
I felt a bit groggy but I just slept for like 14 hours and I was fine.|12782
The second attempt was about two years later and I tried it by cutting as deep as I could on my wrist in the bath, I could not get the guts to cut deep enough so I just kept cutting and cutting all over my arms and legs until I passed out.|12782
"Woke up still in the bath and thought '""fuck I hope no one noticed I passed out'""."|12782
No one did and it had been a couple of hours, I think I may have taken some sleeping pills as well so I would not feel the pain as bad.|12782
"Bad times. """|12782
Fuck...I am a failure even at ending it.|12782
'Damn, I am still here.|12782
"Next time- it has to work next time'""[BK][BK]Like some other people on here, waking up did not change my mind, I thought it was just putting off the inevitable."|12782
I took a whole bunch of pills and my grandparents found me, called 000 and saved my life.|12782
Not that I appreciated it then, but I do now.|12782
[BK][BK]After that I spent 2 weeks in a psychiatric ward until I convinced everyone I was no longer a threat to myself.|12782
A few days after I got home I thought I was alone so I tried to slit my wrists, but my sister walked in on me and I was back in the psychiatric ward for another 3 weeks.|12782
I do not know why this time was different, maybe the medication was starting to work, or the intense therapy or seeing the impact it had on my family (initially I thought they were faking it because they would obviously be better off without me) but when I left hospital for the 2nd time I still wanted to die but I no longer had the will to commit suicide.|12782
[BK][BK]I am very lucky that I have such a supportive and strong family, who helped me through the next few years (I was 16 at the time), got me into see a really good psychiatrist and spoke to school so that the teachers gave me a little more support so I was not overwhelmed by the stress.|12782
I also had 4 months off school when it first happened to heal and get strong enough to go back.|12782
[BK][BK]It took around a year to be happy I did not die and a couple of years to get longer stretches of happiness.|12782
I stopped therapy after 3-4 years and every couple of years I have a couple of sessions when I have a bit of a setback but they are less frequent now.|12782
[BK][BK]I am now in a really good place, it has been 15 years and I am still on medication but I had a major setback when I tried to reduce the dose so if I need meds to stay healthy i figure its a small price to pay.|12782
I have travelled extensively alone and am strong enpugh now to live on the other side of the world to my family though we are still very close.|12782
"[BK][BK]Sorry for the long post but if anyone is going through a difficult time, please PM me, I have been through it and am happy to be a sounding board or support if you need it."""|12782

But i swore i could get through this on my own.|12782
I only attempted once.|12782

I was desperate and not thinking straight and frustrated and angry and i just threw myself headfirst down a set of stairs, blind panicking me thought that would be best.|12782
I was lucky to have not broken anything.|12782

it would break him to find his older brother heaped up at the bottom of the stairs.|12782

Right before jumping I realized that my ceiling fan probably could not support my weight, and that I would likely survive and end up with a horribly mutilated mouse.|12782
"$65 saved my life. """|12782
My exes sister tried to swallow two bottles of pills, then called him seemingly out of the blue, while we were watching tmnt, and was crying and telling him she loved him.|12782
He immediately just knew, and freaked out, we pretty much ran straight to the car, I drove I do not even know how fast to his house, and she was there on the bathroom floor.|12782
I was not close with her because I just have problems getting close to people, and especially in a family situation.|12782
I sat down with her and I just hugged her, I wanted her to just feel me care, instead of hearing useless words.|12782
[BK][BK]When we went to the hospital and they asked her why she did it, she told them she did not know.|12782
She just seemed shocked by the whole thing.|12782
[BK][BK]His family has a history of mental illness, and she definitely was suffering from some form of it, and I hope she has gotten help, but I was a total cunt in the relationship and we do not stay in touch at all.|12782
[BK][BK]She was just going through some intense drama with her friends, and for whatever reason, two bottles of pills was a quick answer to a hard question.|12782
When I was 16 I attempted suicide by jumping off the 6th floor.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up in the hospital in the (S)ICU four days after and my first thought was that I wanted to die.|12782
Not because of my failed attempt.|12782
Not because of my depression but from the sheer pain I felt from my injuries.|12782
I had tubes all over my body and I remember trying to pull out the tubes because I thought that would end all the pain I was in.|12782
As a result of that the Nurses had to tie my hands to the side of my bed.|12782
[BK][BK]I ended up with a calcaneum fracture, a broken lower jaw, half my nose was torn off and pneumonia which worsened into pneumothorax.|12782
I had 13 bags of blood transfused into me during my stay in the hospital too.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not know if it was the pain or whatever but after I was discharged 3 months later I actually got happier.|12782
I think it was because in the hospital I managed to say everything I held inside to my parents and cry all the tears I held back throughout the years.|12782
I would not say I am okay now because I do not think that feeling will ever go away.|12782
But I can say that I am happy with my life now.|12782
I know it is not the answer most people expect and it is definitely not a good way to turn your life around but I just wanted to share.|12782
im extremely embarrassed to admit that i once had a drunken night where i got into a fight with a good friend, had a big fight with my girlfriend at the time and went home and broke a bottle over my head, smashed some windows, sliced my arms up and swallowed about 40-50 pills, i was 15. i woke up and could taste metal and could hardly remember what i had done, instant regret.|12782
i realised it was all drunken bullshit and i was probably going to die.|12782
i was throwing up before part time work at a supermarket on the sunday.|12782
i didnt tell anyone, i was spaced out and throwing up constantly.|12782
i can still taste the metallic phlegm.|12782
i eventually started passing out and they rushed me to the hospital where i was put on a drip and they tried to flush me.|12782
my organs were shutting down they thought.|12782
m mother arrived and we stayed up all night.|12782
the regret i felt as soon as i woke up will always stay with me.|12782
it is not ever worth it.|12782
i was so scared.|12782
do not do it.|12782
i almost died after waking up sober and regretting it.|12782
there would of been nothing i could have done.|12782
now i have a daughter and im the happiest man i know :) sorry for going on.|12782
"'I am still here'""[BK]I was in ninth grade, and shit hit the fan in a major way."|12782
Decided to just sit in the bathroom and swallow as many pills (tylenol) as I could.|12782
Did something like 60.|12782
Went to bed fully expecting to die (I did not know too much about how much Tylenol it would take to kill me) I woke up the next morning and felt the lowest I have ever felt.|12782
I felt ashamed, disgusting and worthless.|12782
But a small part of me was relieved that I did not die during my sleep.|12782
I cannot explain why I changed.|12782
My family moved and I just got out of it.|12782
It''s kind of funny actually.|12782
"One simple action like changing my setting bolted me out of the darkest part of my life to date."""|12782
I got hammered drunk, took a handful of sleeping pills, and laid down in bed to die.|12782
I guess I then decided to go outside instead, where I passed out wearing only pants in the February cold.|12782
A roommate happened to come home and called 911.|12782
I woke up in the hospital some hours later and just felt really numb and confused and ashamed.|12782
The cops came to transfer me to a psych hospital.|12782
They cuffed me, hands behind my back, and threw me in the cop car like a criminal.|12782
Luckily, I did not have to see anyone I knew for a few more hours.|12782
Then my sister came in, and I was just really, really ashamed of myself for trying to kill myself.|12782
She had read my suicide note, which at this point was just an embarrassment.|12782
This was not a failed attempt but at the last moment before I was about to pick between OD and hanging myself.|12782
I decided if I dont care about dying wouldnt it be more fun to see how far I could push my luck before I do die?|12782
[BK][BK]So i spent the next month crossing the street with barely a glance at incoming traffic.|12782
Climbing trees much higher than I should have (fell down a few times too but no real injuries).|12782
I had a few fights with the other tae kwon do students who were both more experienced than me and much stronger than me (they definitely made sure I felt that), walking around through some of the worse areas of my city and a few other stupid things[BK][BK]After an entire month of me still being here I gradually stopped and got better over the next 2-3 years.|12782
Although sense of self preservation was just close to nonexistent until maybe a year ago?|12782
Basically, 'fuck.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]It was not a anger that I did not succeed, it was probably because I think I knew from that point forward I knew my life would be different from that point forward."|12782
[BK][BK]My family would never fully trust me again.|12782
[BK][BK]I took a whole bottle of gravol and downed it with whiskey, i tried to find as many pills as I could and when I was about to pass out I realized I did not wanna die, I had been contemplating it for some time before going ahead with it.|12782
"[BK][BK]I texted my cousin I said, '""I just took a bunch of pills and alcohol, I dont wanna die anymore'""[BK][BK]last thing I remember was passing out as they picked me up and lugged me into the car."|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up in the hospital with the taste of tar, I think?|12782
Whatever it was they use to pump stomachs.|12782
[BK][BK]They kept me in the hospital for about 2 weeks, being in the psych ward was the major convincing piece as to why I smartened up about the whole ordeal, my father ended up passing 2 years later and then I was forced to sort of go back to another hospital for a month and a bit, I was not taking his death very well and dropped out of college.|12782
[BK][BK]I am 26 now and though I have had some personal struggles, I have become a much more resilient individual because of it, I have no patience for superficiality, and anyone who may artificially make their lives harder on themselves.|12782
[BK][BK]My philosophy is that everyone has their own personal struggle, and you should not use those as a crutch, in fact I believe you should use your struggle as motivation.|12782
[BK][BK]It''s not easy of course, and I still get down on myself.|12782
But literature and dreams are what keep me going.|12782
I may never get to the point in my life where I am completely satisfied with what I have accomplished, but I know that I have experienced so much in life, I have traveled so far and done so many things, I could die happy.|12782
[BK][BK]I will not stop experiencing these things, I will keep pushing and striving to be a better individual, to be there for others if they need someone to listen to them.|12782
"[BK][BK]"""|12782
"'I will never be able to drink again'""[BK][BK]I had taken a bunch of over the counter pills, mostly midol which basically destroys your liver and I have a heart condition so the caffeine was making me have heart palpitations."|12782
It was extremely painful and I called 911 myself.|12782
Luckily they were able to get everything out of my system with no permanent damage but if I had I waited until the morning, it is likely I would have died from slow liver failure anyway.|12782
"Shortly after I ended up dating my best friend and now we are married, have 2 beautiful little girls, and one on the way. """|12782
I was fourteen when I attempted suicide and it was very much on an impulse.|12782
I had been thinking about it but I had not planned how, when, where etc.|12782
At the time, all I could think of was 'This has to end now.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I overdosed on pills, then ten minutes later I went downstairs to tell my Mum as I believed I had failed and not taken enough."|12782
I do not remember much after that as I started dipping in and out of consciousness, but I properly woke up in the resuscitation room later in the evening (unsure of timings) in A&E to see an old man across from me, covered in blood and struggling to breathe.|12782
I was very disorientated, shocked and did not really understand what was going on.|12782
"I remember thinking, '""I failed and now I am stuck here.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]One thing that I would like to highlight is that the doctors and medical staff at the time were not very understanding at all.|12782
They were pretty patronizing (I do not want to generalise this to all medical professionals).|12782
"I was repetitively told '""That was a silly thing to do, was not it.'"""|12782
"'""Lots of people''s parents go through divorce and they do not attempt suicide.'"""|12782
"'""Have you learnt your lesson?"|12782
Can you promise us you will not do it again?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]As long as I can remember, my dad was physically and verbally abuse and an alcoholic."|12782
I WANTED my parents to separate so I could escape him but my Mum never had the confidence to do it.|12782
For years I would look after my mother when she had been physically hurt, crying and hiding from my Dad.|12782
However, she would never leave him despite numerous times she said she would.|12782
That''s why I cracked and decided to kill myself because that was the only way I knew how to remove myself from the situation.|12782
"I guess it might have been my own fault that the medical staff were patronizing as I did not tell them this, I only told them that '""I did it because my parents are separating.'"""|12782
"[BK][BK]For anyone interested, my parents finally separated a few months after my attempted overdose and things have been so much better since."""|12782
After cutting my wrists, eating a bottle of sleeping pills I woke up groggy in the bathroom in the morning around crusted blood and a shitty illegible drunken note I wrote and I realized how fucking sad and pitiful it was.|12782
I washed off all the blood off the floor, the sink, and my arms.|12782
Put on a long sleeve and went downstairs.|12782
That was the last time I tried to kill myself.|12782
[BK]This was over a breakup.|12782
And to think a few months later I met my wife playing WoW.|12782
9 years later I have got a little girl great job, a house and I almost did not have all of this.|12782
I know I am a bit late, but I will write here anyways.|12782
[BK][BK]First off, a small bit of background.|12782
Just over a month ago, I attempted suicide, and then the following day walked out of my school during class and walked for approximately 15 kilometers (almost 10 miles for my friends down south) in 3 hours through Canadian snow.|12782
I then spent the next 6 days in the hospital.|12782
When I attempted suicide, I felt like i was doing a selfless thing: I was ridding the world of the atrocity that is me.|12782
So I slit my wrist, and I am relatively sure that I did it right and the bleeding from my wrist would have killed me.|12782
My arm was getting numb and feeling heavy and I was getting light headed.|12782
It was because I stopped myself.|12782
I snapped out of it and immediately stopped the bleeding.|12782
I realized I may have made the wrong decision about  what I was doing, but shortly thereafter I started regretting stopping myself, and for the past month I have been very conflicted as to whether or not I did the right thing by stopping myself.|12782
Thankfully, things may be starting to work out again.|12782
I am now on medication (I was not before and I did not want any because of my very negative experience with prozac) and I will be receiving counseling, which my family and I have struggled to obtain.|12782
I think the worst *may* be behind me, and I am deeply sorry for those whom I have hurt because of what I did.|12782
'God damn it.|12782
I fucked that up too.|12782
Jesus, look at the bandages, I will never be able to live a normal life.|12782
Fuck.|12782
"Next time I will get it right'""[BK][BK]Then I met a guy in the psych ward who shot himself in the head and still survived."|12782
He could not really talk or walk, but they let him play a guitar and he was pretty great.|12782
I met another guy who slit his wrists because he found his child dead under the Christmas tree, electrocuted by the lights.|12782
Those two really put things into perspective.|12782
It''s 9 years later and my life still is not where I want it, but I now have a wife and 15 month old son that I love.|12782
"I have hope."""|12782
I had OD'd, but the hallucinations scared me so much to the point that I ended up calling my best friend.|12782
After going to the emergency room, I started having lots of regrets; mainly that I would called someone and did not wait it out.|12782
I woke up pissed and scared that I was still in my room that was now spinning.|12782
Immediately I ran to the bathroom because my body decided it is time to get these pills out of you.|12782
"After about 30 minutes of throwing up I thought there is still a chance I can die and that I wanted to see my ex (I was a freshman in high school young and blinded by 'love'"")."|12782
I went to see her no one around me still not knowing what I did.|12782
I told them it was just something I ate or whatever.|12782
Thinking I can hold in the vomiting to say my last good bye to her, I end up throwing up all over her driveway.|12782
From there it was to the hospital.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]I always planned on killing myself during or before high school ever since 6th grade.|12782
So when the day came I was full of adrenaline I could not even say I was relieved to escape the depression.|12782
"The whole experience just felt like all my thoughts were in a blender. """|12782
So, this was.. Two years ago.|12782
It was right after thanksgiving dinner with my family(I had been feeling like shit for weeks and holidays are always worse) and we got home around 7ish, sisters and mom left for shopping a half hour later, so a couple minutes after they had left I grabbed my meds(I was taking 5 different pills and if I remember correctly I was consuming about 1050-1075mg of meds a day) and I poured a few into my hand(the largest was 500mg and the smallest was like.. 15mg I think) and I downed them.|12782
"I woke up around 1am and my first thought was 'god damnit.. better clean this mess up before they get home.'"""|12782
Forty minutes later they were home and not a single one knew what happened, they still do not.|12782
"[BK]That was not my first attempt, my first was in 4th grade when I thought it was possible to choke myself to death"""|12782
I did not have a reaction for myself, but I told my little sister what I tried to do and she told my mom.|12782
I was furious with her right up until I saw her face when I was in the hospital.|12782
Out of everyone there she was the only person who is face I remember.|12782
I felt like an asshole, how could I do that to my little sister; just leave her alone without a brother to look after her.|12782
[BK][BK]The next time I thought about suicide was when that very same sister was pregnant.|12782
I went to the hospital to see my niece who was only 8 hours old and just holding that little girl made me want to live.|12782
It's been two and a half years and I no longer let myself get into those dark places.|12782
I have people that care about me unconditionally, and it helps that my niece always runs to me before my sister.|12782
"'Why did I ever think this was a good idea?'"""|12782
I took a bunch of pills.|12782
Thankfully, I had taken the pills with some spoiled milk, so I immediately puked everywhere, and I realized that I would be saying goodbye to all the people and things I cared about.|12782
My cats, my parents, my family, friends, hell, even my co-workers.|12782
"I admit, 18-year old u/ChevroletSparkSS was an utter fucking moron."""|12782
Every time I just felt like it was going to happen again and I would keep struggling for the rest of my life & I felt very little hope.|12782
For me it is like being in a drunk state, so much crying and hard breathing.|12782
"So by the time I put the knife down i am dizzy and just think 'Just wait it out.'"""|12782
I know it is not a great thought or motivating to hear.|12782
But I know I am one to be in the extreme mode of happy or sad.|12782
"I have to see every time if I am ready to be done or if I can go on."""|12782
I have had two suicide attempts.|12782
And I would not lie to you and say that my suicidal ideation has gone away for good.|12782
I am at the point now where I am thankful that I did not succeed those times.|12782
You should know that I am bipolar as well.|12782
Which means I will always cycle through deep depression.|12782
"My first thought the morning after the first attempt was, 'why am I awake?'"""|12782
I was bitterly disappointed in myself for not being strong enough to make sure I was actually dying.|12782
I would tell myself that my existence was a terrible mistake that I needed to fix.|12782
That so much of my life had been awful and painfully lonely that it could not change.|12782
To make matters worse, I did not disclose my suicide attempt to my psychiatrist, I was afraid of being committed and having to go on heavier atypical antipsychotics.|12782
Don''t ignore your support system like I did.|12782
I was 19 at the time in the midst of an incredibly messed up, abusive relationship, and I almost missed out on every breathtaking moment of joy I have had since.|12782
My next suicide attempt is kind of hazy, I know it was mid June 2012, and I know that I did a significant amount of drugs to try to off myself and I remember telling my bf that I was dying and then I remember throwing up quite a bit and hoping it had been long enough that I would absorbed the pills anyways.|12782
It took me quite a while to feel better from that one.|12782
I think I even failed out of my classes, that semester.|12782
In the years since, I have ceased to continually demonize myself, my past actions and I try to focus on the future .|12782
I made a bucket list and self flagellated all over the place about the experiences I have yet to experience.|12782
I have checked off quite a few in the 6 years since my first attempt.|12782
Not nearly all, I hope I keep adding to the list throughout my life.|12782
Things that my psychiatrist said that changed me: Suicidal thoughts are not normal.|12782
It''s not normal to want to kill yourself every day, normal people do not do that.|12782
You are sick, and you cannot get better through force of will alone.|12782
Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.|12782
If your life is so awful that you are looking to run away from your problems.|12782
Actually run away, go far away to a new place, find a better solution to nonexistence.|12782
Because there is no coming back from that one.|12782
So I ran away to the circus essentially and found a better place.|12782
Art therapy saved me more than the medications did, I am down to just the art now.|12782
And my reason for existence now?|12782
"To leave the world slightly better than how I found it."""|12782
Several years ago, I attempted overdose.|12782
Dad found me, force-fed me ipecac, and apparently he, his girlfriend, and his girlfriend's daughter took turns holding me as I just vomited all of creation all over a tarp they laid out in the living room.|12782
I was not conscious for any of that.|12782
[BK][BK]I remember when I woke up, I was ravenous.|12782
I wanted nothing more than just goldfish and Pepsi, and kinda locked myself in a room to play Half-Life 2 for an hour or two.|12782
I just needed some sort of stability or normalcy — I was not sure how to process the fact that I was still around.|12782
[BK][BK]And then I went outside.|12782
Mind you, I had fully and entirely committed that I would not see stars again.|12782
I would not see green, or feel humid Florida air, or hear the breeze lazily whooshing through pine trees.|12782
I went outside, and it was like seeing color for the first time all over again.|12782
I just cried.|12782
I did not know why I was still around, and a large part of me was resentful that I had been saved.|12782
[BK][BK]But part of me was also just overwhelmed with the unending crystalline beauty of everything around me.|12782
And I mean EVERYthing: the humming of tires as traffic dinked about nearby was tied to bee-buzzings and a memory of a cello section from an orchestra rehearsal.|12782
Everything became lightly synesthetic, and I sat in the grass with a mix of happiness and dismay, just...drinking it in without judgment or decisions.|12782
Just feeling it all.|12782
So I survived because I did not pull the trigger, and neither did the police...[BK][BK]Gun pointed at my head, sitting outside my apartment complex, had written the note, called the police saying someone had been shot.|12782
You know, incase the bullet did not kill me, I would get help immediately.|12782
[BK][BK]So I am staring at about 8 cops pointing assault rifles at me, telling me to drop my weapon or they will shoot.|12782
I actually laughed at the officer that said that and called him a dumbass.|12782
And then I thought, I do not wanna be the asshole that some janitor has to clean up off the wall.|12782
So I put the gun down.|12782
[BK][BK]I was later told by the officer that arrested me I am the luckiest S.O.B.|12782
he has ever met, said he had never seen someone have that many guns trained on him, provoke the cops, have a loaded gun out, and live.|12782
"[BK][BK]My attempt may have been a different kind of survive, but my first thought when the cops came up to cuff me was 'it is going to be a hell of next few days'"" and it was."""|12782
I jumped off the overpass, 40 feet to the train tracks below.|12782
I remember the breeze through my hair as I fell and the rush of feeling and euphoria that was banging to a crescendo in my chest.|12782
I also remember feeling the impact.|12782
Blacking out for who knows how long, seeing and feeling a white light in the distance surrounded by blackness.|12782
"[BK][BK]As I came to, the first thing I thought was 'shit shit shit shit I am still alive and my right leg and hip are in excruciating pain'"", then my first coherent thought was '""Now I will have to deal with the pain I am about to cause my mother'""."""|12782
A little back story.|12782
I was a junior in high school, and had just told the girl who I was madly in love with that I liked her two weeks prior.|12782
She rejected me, claiming to have known that I liked her for a while, she just did not say anything about it because she liked the attention.|12782
Also, around this same time my grandfather went into the hospital, and my older brother was visiting home (my older brother is an all around asshole, but everyone loves him and treats me like crap when he is around).|12782
[BK][BK]Day before Christmas, I decided it was time to end it all, but I did not want to ruin everyone's Christmas.|12782
So I waited until the 26th, at three in the morning.|12782
I took about 10 painkillers and tried to drown myself in a bath tub by filling it with water and holding my head under the faucet so that if I struggled, I would hit the faucet and stay in the water.|12782
Must've lasted at least two minutes because I start to feel myself black out, but the pain in my chest became too much.|12782
I jerked my head back from the tub and gasped for air.|12782
The first thought I had was wishing that the girl I had liked and my brother could feel the pain I felt, and that my grandfather's pain would stop.|12782
Why should someone who is led a good life suffer while these selfish people get by okay?|12782
[BK][BK]No one found out about what happened that morning for months, and even today, very few people know about all of this.|12782
This is the way I want to keep it (hence the throwaway), so if you are reading this and know who I am, please refrain from posting any personal details about anyone.|12782
[BK][BK]Fast forward to today, where I am doing much better, enrolled in a good college, and studying hard.|12782
The girl I had liked and I are good friends, my grandfather passed away last August, and my brother and I still are not on talking terms, but that is another story.|12782
If there is anything I have learned, it is that hate will do you no good.|12782
If anyone wrongs you, do not hold on to it.|12782
Let it go, and live for the present, not the past.|12782
Tried to overdose on prescription meds in college.|12782
While my first conscious thought was not exactly positive, it later put things in perspective.|12782
I woke up on my bedroom floor, 2 days later.|12782
When I was finally able to move, I reached in my pocket to find my phone.|12782
(I did not realize 2 days had passed at this point).|12782
My first thought was the realization that not one person had reached out to see where I was.|12782
I had a group of friends, none of which knew about my personal issues because I kept them to myself and these were more or less friends that could be called bad influences.|12782
Even though I could not really blame them for not checking on me, I just found it demoralizing that not one person called or asked where I was or if everything was alright.|12782
But in that brief moment of loneliness and desperation, I realized I had more to live for and that I needed to find more positive people to hang around.|12782
I called my mother, moved home, later moved out of state to a new college.|12782
Now 2 years later, I have met people that are now my closest friends, I am in my last year of school, and dating the love of my life.|12782
I made a bunch of lame attempts in middle school and highschool that in hindsight were probably never going to work (tried drowning myself a few times but instinct always got the better of me and I burst above the surface for air; tried cutting wrists but I got too scared of the pain).|12782
It always just made me hate myself more for lacking the bravery to follow through (and as many people will tell you, suicide is truly not the coward''s path: it takes guts to follow through)[BK][BK]Most recently, I had been having rather frequent (a few times daily) suicidal thoughts, and was planning on jumping out of my 4th story window.|12782
These days, the main thing keeping me from killing myself is the thought of the poor person who would find me.|12782
I really do not want to traumatize some random college student (I live on campus).|12782
The last thing they need to see is one of their peers splattered on the ground.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyways, I tried opening my window only to realize that there is a mechanism preventing it from opening more than 3 or 4 inches.|12782
Part of me was relieved, but another part was disappointed to lose my most convenient method.|12782
[BK][BK]I have tried a few therapists but it has not worked for me.|12782
I want to try medication but I cannot afford it myself and my parents do not believe in prescription medication so they will not help me get it.|12782
"They''ve also tried sending me to a few non-traditional 'psychologists'"" that, as you may predict, did not do anything except destroy what little trust I had in my parents."""|12782
I tried to OD on tylenol when I was twelve.|12782
I was tired of being thrown around between family members, spending my days skipping school to find ways to care for my siblings, since my mother worked full time and my father was out of the house 13 hours of the day, and when he was home he was strung out high or drunk and abusive in every way.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]My grandma ended up making my father take me to the ER, which he tried to avoid doing.|12782
I walked in, stood next to the bed, and apparently fainted(this was after I had already spent hours on a couch at home in and out of consciousness.|12782
[BK][BK]My first conscious thought was waking up on the hospital bed with my father laying beside me groping me.|12782
I screamed st him to get off, and thus was my first conscious thought after realizing I was still alive|12782
Honestly my first conscious thought was this.|12782
'Awesome, I cannot even fucking kill myself correctly.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Basically I am a failure at everything I do and I even failed at suicide."|12782
Well at least no one knows about my many past attempts.|12782
[BK][BK]My first attempt was with a rope, but the rope broke.|12782
[BK]My last attempt was with a revolver that did not fire until I tried to check it over to find out why.|12782
[BK][BK]I have given up on trying.|12782
I have tried, pills, ropes, jumping from heights, drowning, and lastly a gun.|12782
"Never once have I ended up in a hospital from my attempts nor does anyone know more than a injury from climbing or such."""|12782
"'Well, fuck.'"""|12782
I threw up the pills.|12782
I appear to be no more worse for wear.|12782
[BK][BK]But to this day (18 months) I still regret not dying.|12782
I have accepted this is who I am and I am not ashamed of it.|12782
Had it for almost 25 years.|12782
[BK][BK]I liken life to a party: you go, have a good time with a few bad moments, and at the end you are glad you went.|12782
Or, like me, you have a bad time with a few good moments and yet you know you would still rather not have gone.|12782
I am never going to enjoy the party.|12782
Let me take my life safely and give my organs to those still enjoying the party.|12782
[BK][BK]I like hearing when others have found their good times but for those out there that are not - you do not have to pretend you are enjoying to the party, just be honest you are there because your parents said so and you are just waiting to tap out.|12782
[BK][BK]I hate hearing that I am wrong about this thought.|12782
I am not.|12782
Some of us can get every dream and goal we wanted yet still not want to be alive.|12782
"We can do our best to participate and yet we still would rather not be here. """|12782
I tried to cash in my chips a few years ago by taking a nice, long nap.|12782
(Un)Fortunately, I underestimated the strength of my sleeping pills.|12782
[BK][BK]I awoke in the middle of the night with an overwhelming urge to vomit, and my first thought was, 'Oh, shit.|12782
"My room is going to smell awful.'"""""|12782
I woke up from being blackout drunk, vomit and pills in the toilet.|12782
I immediately called my psychiatrist and got a room set up at the hospital.|12782
All I could think of was I cannot believe I threw up.|12782
Three years later and I am battling the same thing.|12782
*sighs* 'Well, I am awake.|12782
Guess I would better get dressed and go to school.|12782

"I cannot even do *that* right.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]I wanted to throw up.|12782
I wanted to scream.|12782
Fuck whoever heard me.|12782
In the end, I laughed so hard.|12782
"I remember feeling so cold, hurt, alone and disappointed I was with myself. """|12782
Alcohol and a massive amount of pills.|12782
[BK]Puked a lot of the pills out before they desolved, guess I am mainly alive as I was out of my chosen daily poison (Rum), so I had resorted to whatever I had laying around, in this case, vodka, which I hold a lot less efficiently.|12782
So when I downed the pills I puked most of them back up.|12782
[BK]Not so much a thought as a feeling.|12782
Just feeling emtpy, a maniacal laughter in the voice of my head, could not even do that right.|12782
[BK]Truth be told the feeling has not yet left 1½ year later.|12782

There was an old bunk bed in my old room, and I decided to hang myself in it while laying down.|12782
[BK][BK]I was all rigged up, laying face down with the rope choking me out, when I heard some of my brothers friends start to walk in the front door.|12782

[BK][BK]I got up, untangled the rope and acted like I was cleaning.|12782

I did not quite make it to the jumping part, I had planned to, but had not quite worked up to it yet when somebody called the police and an ambulance.|12782
Who promptly brought me in.|12782
"Once it was clear I was not an immediate danger to myself the police just left me with the ambulance crew who took me back to my flat (like 30 seconds from the bridge so it was not like they took me home ''instead'' of the hospital, just wanted somewhere to sit down and fill out paperwork/check me over)[BK][BK]All I could think was 'I do not want my flatmate to find out'""[BK][BK]The worst part about it was they would not take no for an answer."|12782
We went back to my flat, despite me asking them several times not to, because I did not want my flatmate to see or hear any of the conversation.|12782
"I would rather random people in the road heard it over having to deal with the inevitable '""So... what happened?'"""|12782
bullshit.|12782
[BK][BK]But they would not fucking grant me that one simple request.|12782
And the result was that they accidentally fucking told my housemate what had just happened.|12782
Which I was not happy about.|12782
[BK][BK]That was December 2014, and was the worst I have ever felt, at that time although suicide had been on my mind constantly for months, it only really takes a few minutes where your mind is so fucked you genuinely believe you *need* to die to come close to it (or make it happen).|12782
[BK][BK]I have made a huge amount of progress since then.|12782
Changed jobs, moved to a cheaper location, paid off some of the debts I had, spent some time away from a very close friend of mine who had attempted suicide several times who I was crippling myself trying to help.|12782
I had not realised how much damage I was doing myself by constantly worrying about them at the time.|12782
I routinely went several days in a row without being able to sleep, even with the help of pills, and would have nightmares whenever I did manage to get some sleep.|12782
I had to take almost 3 months off work and spent almost all of it in bed.|12782
[BK][BK]I am still a bit unstable here and there, and I have mostly had to make that progress myself because of how difficult it is to find mental health services in the local area (and how difficult I personally find it to seek them at times) but I am doing so much better than I was.|12782
My life now, despite needing a lot of work, is incomparable to how it was then.|12782
Which kinda scares me, because I still feel low a lot of the time, and occasionally something will ''set me off'' and I will drink myself stupid or something, I still have involuntary suicidal thoughts regularly.|12782
But it is hundreds of times better than where I was at Christmas 2014, the idea of ever returning there terrifies me.|12782
"[BK][BK]Hopefully everyone in this thread has gotten or is in the process of getting better. """|12782
Throw away time.|12782
Too late to join the party, but I figured it would be a good way to let some steam out.|12782
"[BK][BK]The 'may cause suicidal thoughts'"" lable on anti-depressants is a serious matter."|12782
Back last November, I had to deal with some pretty bad crap, and amidst the worst of it, one night I decided to just take my medication.|12782
After twenty minutes I still had not remotely calmed down, so I took it again.|12782
And again, and again eight more times, for a total of thirty something pills.|12782
Frankly, I was not completely lucid during the whole thing, but I texted some crap out that I really regret having done so now, so I guess I was pretty conscious at some point about killing myself.|12782
I managed to call an ambulance in a moment of clarity, I think, and next thing I know I am in a hospital.|12782
[BK][BK]I was furious and scared it did not work.|12782
I suffer from some pretty heavy PTSD after two tours in the Marines and getting shot in the leg.|12782
I have a shitty family that I acknowledge have manipulated me to stay locked in with them to take care of them and essentially be their little servant.|12782
I am studying something that I frankly have no passion for, and can barely take solace on the fact that my practice hours have gone for a good cause.|12782
I am unemployed and recently single.|12782
I wanted it all to end, and not being able to go through with it was just another failure in my life.|12782
At the same time, I cannot help but think how emotionally unstable I am, that I can just try to do something like this on a whim.|12782
[BK][BK]It''s given me some new appreciation for life.|12782
The whole incident left a very bittersweet note, as it lead to some serious complications with my liver, but it made me realize that there is people that care about me.|12782
"Cliche would, but it is keeping me going."""|12782
How timely.|12782
I literally tried to commit suicide just this weekend.|12782
Used an electrical cord and tied it to the door handle - I was afraid the closet beam would break.|12782
"[BK][BK]I remember thinking, 'Wow this is really effective, this is really painful, this is really scary.'"""|12782
Then my boyfriend came in and caught me, though I thought he was going to be gone for a while.|12782
"[BK][BK]My first thought was, '""I am going to catch hell."|12782
Things will be even worse now.|12782
I fucked up big time.|12782
"I hate myself more than ever.'"""|12782
My boyfriend told me what a selfish asshole I was being and to grow up.|12782
So much shame and guilt and I cannot even quantify it.|12782
"[BK][BK]The next day he was angry because I was not properly '""over it.'"""|12782
"Though I am still not sure what that means - I guess because I am still depressed?"""|12782
Had everything planned out.|12782
Went for it with a foolproof method that would drift me away forever.|12782
Heard something I should not have heard, which scared me more than what I was trying to do (no, it was not a person or anything creepy, just something I had believed I had taken care of).|12782
"So I said, 'Dammit, maybe I need help'"" and got help."|12782
[BK][BK]Spent overnight in the hospital, a few days at an institute, and off my merry way to therapy and meds.|12782
[BK][BK]No one close to me knows.|12782
"Sorta vague on purpose."""|12782
There were a lot of problems in my home.|12782
I was 15.|12782
I took a handful of Benadryl.|12782
I started falling asleep and thought, ''This is not so bad.|12782
''[BK][BK][BK]When I woke up, I was dizzy and I had a hard time focusing.|12782
Part of me was relieved that I would woken up, but another part was sad that I would still have to deal with my life.|12782
I cannot remember the context, but my parents told me that if someone told a therapist that they had suicidal thoughts, their life would basically be over, it would be on every personal record for the rest of their life.|12782
It really scared me from getting any kind of professional help.|12782
Home life did not get better, I just learned to manage my emotions so I would not be driven that far again (mostly getting out more).|12782
[BK][BK][BK]I have only told two people I did this, both were SOs.|12782
"The first one told me during an argument, 'Maybe my life would have been better if you tried again.'"""|12782
The second one is really protective of me and keeps a close watch of any kind of pharmaceuticals I get, I can understand.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]My life is much better now, though there are still times when I can feel the tingle to do it again.|12782
I worry some times how easily that part of me gets triggered, but the thought passes quickly.|12782
"Usually I think of all the things I still want to do, sometimes it is as simple as wanting to have dinner with my SO that night, and the bad thoughts go away."""|12782
Being a paramedic, I find it difficult to say the right things to people that have tried to hurt themselves.|12782
I never know if I am helping by talking to them or making things worse.|12782
I try to not come across as judgemental and I am probably saying things they hear all of the time from others.|12782
"I try not to approach suicide attempts as a 'cry for help'"", or try to be their savior."|12782
Most do not offer up a lot of info and I do not want to seem cold by just doing my job.|12782
I can only hope that they realize that there are caring people out there that really are trying to help, but just do not know how to approach the situation without making it worse.|12782
[BK]I will admit I suffer from depression and have currently started taking medication to help battle it.|12782
I know how I would commit suicide, but I also do not think I could go through with it.|12782
The comments here have helped me look at this from many different perspectives, especially the ripple effects on family and friends.|12782
I could not imagine what my suicide would do to our son.|12782
I know I would be screwed up for life if my dad killed himself.|12782
"[BK][BK]Stay safe!"""|12782
It took about a week before I finally realised that it had not worked.|12782
[BK][BK]I would taken a few packets of Paracetamol on Friday afternoon.|12782
That weekend we were due to visit my family, so figured I would become very ill at some point during the weekend and then be hospitalised before dying with friends and family around me.|12782
[BK][BK]Fell asleep on the afternoon and could manage to carry on driving, so asked my wife to take over.|12782
We had to stop so I could throw up.|12782
Wasn't much vomit, and was 6 hours+ since I would taken the pills so still thought I would done enough.|12782
[BK][BK]At this point I debated telling my wife, but decided to stick with my plans and I wanted to die somewhere familiar.|12782
[BK][BK]Spent the the weekend enjoying every moment.|12782
I would sit there with an odd smile on face as I watched my daughter play with grand parents and cousins.|12782
This was probably the last time I would see these people happy like this.|12782
It was beautiful.|12782
Any moment I was ready and prepared for my liver to start giving out (the expected consequence of the OD) and then I knew that the end would come.|12782
[BK][BK]Then the weekend was over and we went home.|12782
Still I thought it might happen.|12782
My wife went back to work.|12782
Life carried on, as it does.|12782
[BK][BK]It's at this point I told my wife what I had done, and what I had expected to happen.|12782
Lots of crying from both of us.|12782
Promises made to seek help.|12782
We would get through this we told each other.|12782
[BK][BK]After time, I knew that I could not leave my daughter - who was only 2 at the time, and would probably spend a good part of her life trying to understand why her daddy would rather die than be with her.|12782
It would be unthinkable.|12782
[BK][BK]I have gotten better; not perfect, though who is?|12782
[BK][BK]The hardest part for me now is that weekend is still one of the happiest memories I have.|12782
"So....my first thought was 'Which time?'"""|12782
Unlike most everyone else here, I was never hospitalized, and I did not get super close to dying?|12782
I do not know how to word it, exactly.|12782
I do not know if you had call me a survivor, as I basically sucked at trying to die, for all my efforts.|12782
My Mom also cared more about her sex life, her friends, and her pot than whether or not I was trying to take myself out so even when I should have been hospitalized, I never was.|12782
[BK][BK]I did get feint from blood loss a few times and once of my overdose attempts knocked me out for a few hours the way Nyquil might, but that was it.|12782
"[BK][BK]Honestly, I would say every time, even the stupid shit I did recently when I lapsed after *eleven years without an attempt* (sigh), it was always a variation on '""What the fuck was I thinking?"|12782
"I should have done (*insert whatever here*), instead.'"""|12782
"'""I am so godamn stupid.'"""|12782
"'""I am so godamned worthless, I cannot even die right.'"""|12782
"[BK][BK]I wish I could say it was something profound and life changing like '""Oh thank God,'"" or '""I got a second chance,'"" or something like that, but the reality is that it is not that simple for most of us."|12782
Most of us either have a mental illness, severe trauma, or grew up in a shitty environment, or a combination of all of those (*waves* Hi, hello, right here).|12782
And it takes a lot more than managing to survive to help most of us crawl out from under that shit.|12782
"[BK][BK]There''s so much I could say on this topic in terms of my mental health and state and how so many of us struggle for most of our lives, but those are answers to questions that were not asked. """|12782
The first time I gave it a real go was by overdose.|12782
It was not very well planned.|12782
I would been thinking about it for a while and finally confided in a close friend, who encouraged me to kill myself because if I was that depressed I might as well, and my friends did not like me anyway.|12782
So I took whatever I could get my hands on - I know it was mostly my sleeping pills but I do not remember how many or what else was mixed in there.|12782
[BK][BK]Obviously it was not enough.|12782
I woke up feeling like shit.|12782
I really wanted to die, both because I was depressed as hell and because I wanted to make that friend feel bad for being a dick about it.|12782
So I woke up feeling confused and stupid and wishing I would thought it through better.|12782
I drifted in and out of consciousness on the way to the hospital, and while I was there I just felt bad that I would interrupted my parents' day for this.|12782
[BK][BK]I did not regret trying but I regretted failing.|12782
I still wish I would got it right that time because now I am too scared to try it unless I know that it will definitely work.|12782
"I took an overdose of a beta blocker (massive OD of Propranolol) my housemates had driven me to it, and when they found out, one accused me of faking, the other said 'Well, he clearly wants to die, so let him.'"""|12782
Eventually they realised I was not fucking around they called an ambulance.|12782
[BK]After being taken to hospital and examined, a nurse approached me saying the phone had been ringing off the hook, it was my grandma, my mum and my sister, the first thought I had that was coherent was how much I would have missed out on and that despite the way my brain was currently working, people did in fact care about me... a lot.|12782
"My sister drove down half the country to come pick me up and made me live with her, now I am in university and thankful every day that I am alive that I did not succeed."""|12782
I joined Reddit just to answer this; I read threads every once in awhile, but know little about the ins and outs so patience for the newbie...[BK][BK]My first moment awake was total shock.|12782
Then deep, raging anger.|12782
After consuming close to 500 sleeping pills, I awoke in the ICU extremely confused and disoriented.|12782
I remember making my hands into fists and trying to touch them together but my arms would not work!|12782
I was with it enough to realize 'omg!|12782
"My arms will not work!'"""|12782
but out of it enough to not realize that my arms were restrained.|12782
I was in and out of consciousness off and on those 3 days in the ICU, but always felt this rage, like I wanted to get the hell out of there.|12782
I tried to rip out my own catheter and felt nothing <---- this makes me nauseous to even really ponder today.|12782
"[BK][BK]I will never forget the moment I told a nurse '"" I want to get out of here!"|12782
"When can I go smoke a cigarette?!'""."|12782
Her answer made my blood run cold.|12782
"'""You are not going anywhere; you tried to kill yourself."|12782
"You''ll be admitted upstairs to the psych ward...voluntarily or not.'"""|12782
Que rage, helplessness...|12782
Pure torment :''(  One of the scariest, most out of control moments of my life.|12782
I was so upset.|12782
I never meant to be around for any consequences.|12782
It was not a cry for help.|12782
I was done, my soul literally could not bare anymore pain.|12782
I am normally a sentimental schmuck...but I did not leave a note, never said a goodbye, I simply drove around town buying pills, my tear stained face turned to a brave mask, and checked myself into a hotel to end my life.|12782
[BK][BK]My mom and my aunt came in to talk to me after that nurse left.|12782
I literally have no memory of what they said.|12782
I was still very out of it from all the drugs and maybe from the seizure I had?|12782
But what I DO remember is after that talk, something in my brain clicked.|12782
Something in my soul vibrated again.|12782
And as I rode the elevator to psych ward, I surrender all.|12782
It was my rock bottom...and it freed me to move forward.|12782

[BK](also this is a throawaway for obvious reasons)[BK][BK]My girlfriend attempted suicide after her first boyfriend treated her like shit when she was 15 years old (she is now 18) and she was not messing around.|12782
She took like 20-25 sleeping pills and went to bed expecting to never wake up again.|12782
[BK]Instead she woke up in the hospital and was told her parents brought her there after they heard her vomiting in her room, which she cannot even remember at all.|12782
[BK][BK]I met her last year and she told me about this about half a year ago.|12782
I have a troubled past too and was close to do something along those lines myself but, thankfully, never actually was strong enough to do it.|12782
[BK][BK]We both regret our suicidal thoughts / actions of our past but now we are really happy together and very thankful to be alive.|12782
[BK][BK]Now comes the part I could need advice on from people with similar experiences: Her parents started being afraid of it happening again and she felt really controlled, being watched all the time.|12782
"Which...i can understand somewhat from her parents point of view, but still it makes her feel quite miserable at times when 'the walls have ears'""."|12782
She wants to leave home as soon as possible but since she will be at university for at least another 4-5 years with only a small part time job on the side it wont be as easy to support living on her own without her parents support.|12782
And she hates being dependent on them.|12782
"[BK][BK]The thing is...I actually feel like most of this supposed '""control'"" of her parents is just in her head and based on guilt because of her suicide attempt."|12782
The first few months she told me she could not stay overnight because her parents would not allow it.|12782
But she never even asked them in the first place.|12782
"And when she did they said: '""Sure go ahead'""[BK][BK]There were several of these moments where I got the feeling she is paranoid about her parents."|12782
I guess they did get freaked out by her attempt and tried to keep her safe, but now they are quite relaxed again and she does not see it.|12782

")[BK][BK]Was one very unhappy dude for a very long time. """|12782
I had taken a bunch of sleeping pills.|12782
I fell asleep crying and woke up the next day late afternoon.|12782
My first thought was sadness because I was still here also no one had noticed.|12782
I felt really alone.|12782
[BK][BK]I got help and slowly started feeling better.|12782
I have my ups and downs but fortunately I have not been that bad again.|12782
I had to also learn to not rely on other people for my happiness.|12782
I was was buying supplies, Gorilla tape and big, very thick garbage bags.|12782
The plan was to wrap myself in one layer and then wrap a second one within it, in a shower, in the dark.|12782
Just remove a sensation at a time, let the shower keep the bag temperature comfortable, as I run out of air.|12782
Ultimately I did not do it and checked myself into a facility.|12782
I felt so weak.|12782
It was an incredibly dumb way to do it with plenty of points of failure.|12782
It was melodramatic.|12782
[BK][BK]I still feel like I failed, even with all the progress I made in life.|12782
All the cliches and pills thrown my way never changed that.|12782
[BK][BK]And the facility was terrible.|12782
They basically isolate you from the real world with nothing to do.|12782
There's no stimulation at all.|12782
The intake nurse is a fucking bouncer, and the only reading material these fuckers had was a bible.|12782
Hardly a comforting scenario.|12782
I felt even more trapped.|12782
I had 10 minutes left in my shift before I was going to drive to the Golden Gate Bridge to jump.|12782
I had become so exhausted from life that the thought of dying became a pleasant idea.|12782
It got to the point to where it was all I thought about.|12782
My senior manager had noticed how depressed I had become over the previous months and decided to take me aside and ask what was going on.|12782
She must have known or had a hunch because she was not letting me go until she heard my plans for the day.|12782
After I confessed, she drove me to the nearest hospital to stay for the night.|12782
[BK]Talking to my mom from the hospital phone was the hardest part.|12782
I got out the next day and had my girlfriend awaiting me and tons of voicemails from loved ones.|12782
[BK][BK]A year later and I am nowhere near how I was then.|12782
I am pursuing a career in EMS and grateful to be here.|12782
I was twelve when I first was 100% I was a male.|12782
(I am ftm)[BK][BK]No one cared, I had been raped by my girlfriend, forced into kissing this guy (that I only dated cause I thought he was a good guy), and I had just been kicked out of my school.|12782
No one would talk to me, I had no friends, and I did not have any use.|12782
[BK][BK]I grabbed a glock form the closet, wrote my letter, and sat down to listen to my last song.|12782
As I put the gun into my mouth and tried to pull the trigger, I realized I forgot to take the safety off.|12782
In the moment as I just pulled the gun out of my mouth I just threw it across the room.|12782
I got a message on tumblr from someone and I figured I would give it a shot.|12782
[BK]Here I am, years later.|12782
This is not an exact reply to the poster.|12782
But I am putting it here in case anyone is browsing this thread with morbid curiosity like I did when I was looking for inspiration for the best ways to kill myself.|12782
[BK][BK]It is a hell of a road but it gets better.|12782
Don''t give up and kill yourself, not yet.|12782
Give yourself a few months and promise yourself that you will at least try until then.|12782
I gave myself six months after I decided antidepressants as a last resort (had avoided them because of stigma) and it truly saved my life.|12782
It''s not the same for everyone but I will never forget the first time I felt happiness again.|12782
I had locked myself in my room for so long and had found pleasure in nothing.|12782
Nothing big or small could sway how horrible I felt and how much of a chore it was just to go through the motions.|12782
[BK][BK]Then after a few months (yes months) on antidepressants, I was driving down the road and I thought to myself, 'What a nice day.|12782
"It''s really pretty outside.'"""|12782
Then it hit me like a ton of bricks that it was the first time I had a single positive thought in so long that I finally broke down and cried the good tears.|12782
It felt so good to have something feel good.|12782
I got out of my car and sat in the sun and literally soaked up every little bit of that good feeling I could.|12782
[BK][BK]Please do not give up, guys.|12782
"It sucks and it is hard but I promise when your moment in the sun comes after months of darkness that it will not erase the pain but there will be a little enjoyment of life again, and it will be good."""|12782
I am late as fuck, but I took 56 diphenhydramine sleeping pills on a Thursday night and do not remember much until Sunday night.|12782
I was hallucinating hard, and I remember talking to a cop, vaguely remember the pain of the nurses inserting a catheter, then nothing.|12782
I remember waking up strapped to the bed in the ICU very confused, wondering why my parents were there and why my friends were asleep on the floor.|12782
I finally came to full awareness when no one happened to be in the hospital room with me, late Sunday night, and cried so hard the nurse came in and gave me something to put me to sleep.|12782
"To answer the question explicitly, once I came to afterwards I knew I was going to have to stay in a psych ward for at least a week, and that there was no avoiding what felt like my 'punishment'"" for failing to successfully commit suicide."|12782
"I kept thinking, '""If my life was not fucked before this, it sure as hell is now."|12782
"I will never have the chance to try again because now everyone is aware that I am suicidal.'"""""|12782
I am sorry if this is too unrelated, but I have a story to tell about something that happened last night.|12782
I make my point in the last paragraph.|12782
[BK][BK]I was under a lot of stress.|12782
I started out fine, but these thoughts started invading about these scenarios going wildly out of control and resulting in me being deeply hurt.|12782
Every time I caught myself, I would try to calm down and think of positive things instead.|12782
This went on for a while.|12782
[BK][BK]Then I heard my two cats in another part of the house have a huge fight.|12782
This really set me over the edge, but not at first.|12782
First I tried to think of it as a test to see if I can think positively even after that happened.|12782
What I was really doing was suppressing my negative feelings which prevailed anyway.|12782
I started crying hard and felt really low.|12782
It felt like there was something deeply wrong with me and that i was alone.|12782
[BK][BK]Then a really silly idea came to me.|12782
I decided to go to my dresser and pull out this stuffed bunny that I used to adore when I was a kid.|12782
(I should mention that I am in my 20s and male.)|12782
I have not thought about this thing since I was somewhere between 5 and 10[BK][BK]Anyway, I slept with my stuffed bunny last night and did childish things like hug it, rub noses with it, and just lay there staring into its eyes.|12782
The therapeutic effect this had on me was enormous and kind of unexpected.|12782
After just a few minutes, I felt this amazing sense of security and that everything was going to be alright.|12782
This is not something I feel like I could have done with any living thing I know.|12782
[BK][BK]At first I just laid there staring at it and just cried.|12782
Except this was not a bitter cry.|12782
It felt more like a release.|12782
It was as if this bunny was absorbing and deleting all negative feelings I was having.|12782
After that, I felt that sad-happy feeling like in the movie Inside Out.|12782
It felt like this bunny was really alive and had a soul and understood me.|12782
Whether or not this is actually true is completely irrelevant at this point.|12782
The feeling was real, and that is what mattered.|12782
"I brought myself to tell the bunny out loud things like 'thank you'"" and '""I love you'""."|12782
[BK][BK]This was a powerful moment for me that I am glad I had.|12782
The reason I am saying all this here is because it might help you guys immensely to find a way to get in touch with the good parts of your inner child.|12782
Also, do not underestimate the importance of social bonding as it is a basic human _need_, not just a nice thing to have.|12782
"[BK][BK]Edit: changed '""positive living things'"" to '""positive things'""."|12782
"Thanks phone..."""|12782
I do not know of if this is against the rules to post,  but I am doing it anyways.|12782
I just want to say thankyou to everyone who has posted.|12782
I have just finished my first round of therapy after having depression for a long long time,  and every time I would have to fill out a form.|12782
It basically asked on a scale of one to ten how you feel,  what you feel able to do and all that jazz.|12782
The last question was if you have ever had suicidal thoughts,  why have not you attempted suicide this week?|12782
I could never really think of an answer.|12782
Looking through a lot of these posts I have now found an answer.|12782
Although I have had and continue to have suicidal thoughts,  they are fleeting.|12782
They may last for around half an hour,  but they are moments,  nothing more.|12782
So thank you everyone for posting in here.|12782
It's really helped me realize that just because I feel like that sometimes,  it will pass,  and I will continue.|12782
The first time, I tried to hang myself with a length of chain, which slipped and pinched my neck--the pain of that was worse than dying, apparently.|12782
It shocked me into survival mode, I lifted myself up and breathed.|12782
After that, I heard my dad talking upstairs, and I panicked to get the thing off.|12782
[BK][BK]'I cannot even hang myself right.|12782
What a failure.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I cried for about an hour."|12782
Dad still does not know.|12782
[BK][BK]The second time, I was going to shoot myself.|12782
I am not sure if it really counts as an attempt because I never pulled the trigger, but I had the barrel of a loaded 30.06 in my mouth, and I had written my note.|12782
I started thinking about who would find me--it would probably be my dad, my mom, or one of my brothers.|12782
My sisters would have been at school.|12782
I started thinking about that, and the thing that drove me off it was that Mom would be cleaning up her baby''s brain off the wall.|12782
I could not handle that, so I took it out of my mouth, ejected the round, and hid the bolt someplace.|12782
Still have not found it, to this day--I think I blocked it out or something.|12782
"But this is what I thought, then:[BK][BK]'""They can never know, and these bullets are not allowed in my room anymore."|12782
"'""[BK][BK][BK]My older brother knows I have attempted, but no one else in my family does."|12782
A few close friends, too.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: Just because someone''s funny, seems laid-back and lighthearted, and smiles all the time, it does not mean that they are happy.|12782
It does not mean they are not struggling with their demons.|12782
Both of my attempts were partially vengeful acts against my parents.|12782
I was really messed up during those times in my life, and nobody would have guessed that I was suicidal, but I was.|12782
[BK][BK]Don''t ever be afraid to ask someone how they are really doing.|12782
"If I would had that chance to be honest, I could have avoided some horrible things."""|12782
I was so mad I was still alive.|12782
I still am.|12782
I would have cried but my body was too dehydrated.|12782
It completely hollowed me out emotionally I am dead inside.|12782
I am just waiting to die now so i do not hurt anyone.|12782
I still remember the anger of realizing i was conscious.|12782
Sometimes when I wake up i get the same feeling knowing I am still here.|12782
Outwardly my life is together now, it is been a few years and I have achieved a lot but its always for someone else's sake.|12782
So yeah anger|12782
I dunno if I am a suicide survivor really.|12782
But [this](https://medium.com/@PurpleBooth/tuesday-night-wednesday-morning-6727c2c9981d#.1kelmkh2g) happened last week.|12782
[BK][BK]Basically I was going to jump off a bridge but the Samaritans talked me into not doing it from a payphone, half way through I ran out of money, but they gave me the free to call from payphones number like a second before the money ran out and I talked to a second person.|12782
I had already been at A&E that night and escaped, and all I could think about was if the person who I talked to first knew that it had turned out okay and they had saved my life or if they were worried about me and it was stressing them out.|12782
[BK][BK]I guess I am not really a survivor because they talked me down before I actually did it.|12782
I tried to cut my wrists twice as hard as I could.|12782
I do not know why, but that knife could pierce my skin.|12782
I threw the knife down on the ground crying because I realized what had occurred.|12782
It's like I knew it was not answer but I still thought it would solve all my problems.|12782
It was life changing.|12782
My dad will not convince himself I tried to do.|12782
But it is who I am and what has defined me.|12782
I am me.|12782
Please, if there is no one out there to talk to, talk to me.|12782
It is not worth it at all.|12782
[BK][BK]I am so happy I am alive today and I actually run my own clothing company dedicated to self health and positive self esteem.|12782
Shameless plug to it, but www.happyoutfitters.net[BK][BK]I am trying to create a more national recognition.|12782
Suicide and depression needs to be talked about more.|12782
I do not want anyone to ever be there, no one needs to take their own life.|12782
The world is beautiful and there is just so much to see and so much to experience.|12782
I tried to drink myself to death.|12782
I know it is a shitty way to do it but for an alcoholic it seemed fitting.|12782
I woke up in my suit on the couch the next day still drunk at 5pm feeling like shit and confused.|12782
I realized I was alive and that it was a terrible idea.|12782
I checked my phone and say that lots of friends were both concerned and giving me shit for getting that drunk.|12782
So i had people that cared about me.|12782
I went back to bed and slept till the next day and finally had the worst hangover of my life two days later.|12782
I have never been that low again.|12782
I tested and swung on the rope, then I hung myself from a tree in my back yard.|12782
I woke up at the bottom of the hill with the rope tightly around my neck, gasping for breath.|12782
The knot that I tied was stuck, and closing my airway.|12782
[BK][BK]The first thing I did was go inside, to my mother, and point to the rope around my neck.|12782
I could not breath, and was blacking-out with stars flashing all around me.|12782
Apparently my neck was bloody too.|12782
[BK][BK]I was numb.|12782
My mother told me that I would be going to a clinic, and I just shrugged.|12782
The next day, and for four months I was at a clinic.|12782
I passed through a lot of pain and anger there.|12782
[BK][BK]When I joined school again (6th grade), I was completely empty.|12782
-Like I had just started life again.|12782
It was bumpy, but I had the skills to cope, and grow.|12782
I threw up a whole lot and I was not really thinking about anything except for how physically badly I felt.|12782
After I was done throwing up I cried for about a solid hour.|12782
There were not really many solid thoughts in my head it was mostly a manic rush of really miserable and really angry things.|12782
I calmed down and then I did not really feel or think anything.|12782
It was this weird kind of calm where it was like I went on auto pilot.|12782
"I do not think I ever hit a point where I thought about whether I was glad it had not worked or not, it always just felt like 'well that just did not happen.'"""|12782
""""|12782
"(After 5 attempts across 6 months)[BK]'Why the hell am I doing this, I think I am just being selfish if I leave everyone who loves me behind'""[BK][BK]And yet without attempting in the first place I would not have changed for the better."""|12782
I would suggest watching A long way down.|12782
Great movie related to this topic.|12782
I am not looking for sympathy and honestly, I am kind of pissed that it did not work.|12782
[BK][BK]I tried to overdose on Depakote.|12782
Like, a lot.|12782
Around half of a 90ct bottle of 750mg tablets, which I was taking because I am also an epileptic.|12782
Anyways, my mom found me in the garage after my ex told her he was worried about me.|12782
It had already been awhile since I took them, and I told the nurses at the ER that I had taken like, ten instead of the actual forty to sixty pills that were in my system.|12782
So they did not pump my stomach and they took their sweet damn time transferring me to another hospital.|12782
Suited me just fine.|12782
[BK][BK]Long story short, I spent the entire night throwing up black vomit and like, possibly hallucinating.|12782
The nurses tried to carry me to the bathroom to help me throw up, but I did not make it and I got vomit all over my gown.|12782
This was like, three in the morning.|12782
A quick blood analysis showed that I was like, dead.|12782
Going to die, *definitely*.|12782
The doctor was called in from his house, and they asked my mom to come to the hospital.|12782
[BK][BK]The vomit was coming out of my nose.|12782
I really thought I was going to do it.|12782
I thought I was going to succeed.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up at midnight two days later with a Jamaican nurse sitting in my room.|12782
I started crying and she sang to me to calm me down, and held me in her arms.|12782
[BK][BK]All I could think was that I wanted to go home.|12782
"1st thought: 'Ew I am lying in a pool of vomit'"" [BK][BK]2nd thought: '""why are my arms burned?"|12782
"'""[BK][BK]3rd though: '""I am going to flunk that paper due today'""[BK][BK]Shitty OD attempt while manic, had not slept for 3 days and was fucked up on klonopin."|12782
Self-harmed a bunch and then downed a few bottles of pills with liquor.|12782
[BK][BK]Turns out my shitty suicide research saved my life; the two drugs I had taken the most of nullified each others'' effects on my heart.|12782
Only lasting effects from the whole episode are the burn scars still faintly visible on my arm.|12782
[BK][BK]Professor was cool as fuck and gave me extra time on the paper.|12782
"Got help from mental health people soon after and life has for the most part been marginally better since."""|12782
"After the first attempt, my first thought when I woke up in the hospital was, 'Shit, I need to try again.'"""|12782
Got home two days later.|12782
"After the second attempt, my first thought was, '""I am a fucking failure.'"""|12782
"One failed suicide attempt feels shitty, but a second failed attempt feels even worse. """|12782
I did not lose consciousness.|12782
I do not really remember the immediate aftermath very well.|12782
I sort of remember being taken to the hospital and wondering what the big deal was, but I think that might be a false memory.|12782
[BK][BK]The first memory I am confident of is sitting on a hospital bed in the ER being told that I could either be willingly admitted the the juvenile psychiatric ward, or I could waste hours of everyone's time and be marched up there by an armed police officer.|12782
I am pretty sure all I felt at the time was frustration, mostly about how big a deal everyone was making about it.|12782
[BK][BK]I am better now.|12782
I cannot honestly say I am a functional human being, but after ten years or so I have grown up quite a bit.|12782
Why is the 'easy way' so fucking hard?|12782
[BK][BK]The last time I tried I was intent on hanging myself(emulating Robin I think) so I fashioned a noose and put the end of it over the door and closed it.|12782
Wrapped the noose around my neck and just let my legs go limp.|12782
I passed out then my body just stood up all on its own.|12782
I woke up standing and mildly choking.|12782
after months (years?)|12782
of lurking, I finally created an account just to answer this one (english is not my native language and now I am also pretty tired so I will not consider myself responsible for grammatical atrocities...)[BK][BK]26yo here.|12782
[BK]well...a little bit more than a year ago, I think it was mid-february (2015), I tried to hang myself at home.|12782
It was a tough time both for me and for my family, and I had decided to come back home some months before to try and fix things, or so I thought.|12782
[BK]needless to say, I did not manage to fix shit, and everything went all downward spiral on me and my parents (and brother and sister).|12782
[BK]so, one night of mid-february, I had enough.|12782
enough of bad luck, enough of things always going downhill, enough of myself and my stupid inability to solve problems.|12782
[BK]years before, with my father, we had built a home gym in a empty room, it was fun and a great father-son experience.|12782
the gym had basically everything: a bench, squat stands, a barbell, three pairs of dumbbells, a jumping rope, a friggin' homemade punching bag!|12782
and of course, there was a pullup-bar mounted on the ceiling.|12782
[BK]now you can see where the story's going.|12782
I sat on the bench, took the jumping rope, set up a slipknot on the pullup-bar, stepped on the bench, arranged the noose around my neck, and put my feet off the bench.|12782
[BK]one second, two second, X seconds.|12782
I do not remember exactly.|12782
[BK]it started to feel tight and I could not breath.|12782
[BK]instinctively, my hands gripped the rope.|12782
there is one particular feeling I will always remember:[BK]the fabric of the rope.|12782
[BK]it was so strong, so real, so intricate, so beautiful.|12782
there was a lot of work behind it, for sure.|12782
so much marvellous complex simplicity and simple complexity at the same time.|12782
I was able to feel it, finally I was able to feel *something*, after months and months of nothing.|12782
[BK]and it hit me.|12782
[BK]I do not know exactly what hit me, but it did.|12782
[BK]maybe the realization that it was a shame to waste a life in such a useless and pointless way, the realization that if the fabric of the rope was so beautiful, what could be said about a human being, the very expression of nature's (and maybe the entire universe's) fathomless power?|12782
[BK]I kicked my feet back and forth, and I was able to step on the bench again.|12782
I untied the knot, took a looooong breath, the longest of my whole life.|12782
I stepped off the bench again and sat on a chair.|12782
[BK]and...I started laughing.|12782
like goddamn fucking crazy.|12782
like the Joker himself.|12782
I could not help it.|12782
at all.|12782
I think I laughed for 10 minutes straight, or maybe more.|12782
then I fell asleep on the chair, and the sun woke me up at dawn.|12782
[BK]so that is it.|12782
I never said anything to my parents, even though in the following months I told the story to pretty much everyone I know, because I felt the compulsive need to share it to get it off my chest.|12782
[BK]I am not sure if this qualifies as an answer to your question, since the conscious thought happened before and not after my suicide attempt.|12782
[BK]but yeah...I always wanted to share it with some strangers on the internet, and maybe now it was the right time to do it, I do not know.|12782
[BK]now my life is better, in the end I sort of managed to solve my family's problems, even though it pretty much drained my mind and I had to stop my academic career for a while.|12782
[BK]I plan to resume it in the future, next year, or maybe not.|12782
[BK]but I feel fine, all things considered I managed to keep fighting pretty well after that episode, and most importantly, I am still here.|12782
[BK]never stop fighting, no matter the shit your life throws at you.|12782
[BK]never yield to circumstances.|12782
NEVER surrender.|12782
[BK]peace to you all.|12782
I was sad.|12782
I did not want to wake up.|12782
I was just so tired of feeling, I wanted to lay down and just drift off.|12782
I suppose I woke up and threw up a lot, I remember my friend coming by with food and coffee, but I was just sad.|12782
I am still in a very bad place.|12782
Unneeded.|12782
But I do not think I will ever have the courage to try it again.|12782
I just wish it could have worked.|12782
Of course I could not do it right, again.|12782
Got to go farther next time, stop being a coward.|12782
For me it was confusion.|12782
And the need to breathe.|12782
I was exhaling the contents of my stomach at the time.|12782
The pure primal panic took hold and I was just spewing tablets everywhere.|12782
Then I passed out for a bit, then I woke up covered in puke.|12782
[BK][BK]Then I crawled back into the house ( I went to the shed to do the deed) and crawled into bed.|12782
No one really seemed to notice anything had happened, my house mates just thought I was sick and I was FUCKING sick for about 4 days.|12782
At first I wondered if I was still going to die because it felt that bad, and then as I got better I just decided that taking a cocktail of all the pharmaceuticals you can find is a stupid way to try and off yourself so I put the decision off until I could find a better way.|12782
[BK][BK]And then I never did.|12782
[BK][BK]If my house mates every suspected anything they never said or did anything about it.|12782
I took a bunch of whatever I could find.|12782
Tylenol, aleve maybe benadryl but I do not really remember.|12782
It kind of just happened automatically.|12782
I was going to keep taking more and I realized my mother's birthday was the next day so I stopped l. I woke up and I had pain in my lower back.|12782
I let it go for 2 or 3 days before I finally decided I should tell my someone.|12782
I asked my mom if I could talk to her and I told her what I had tried to do.|12782
I felt almost selfish for once I had realized the timing and that I had put people who loved me into that horrible position.|12782
A very verbal sigh.|12782
[BK][BK]My depression was/is caused mainly by boredom.|12782
Although that does not really feel like the right word.|12782
[BK][BK]Nothing in the world whatsoever is stimulating.|12782
Like being in a perpetual state of complete uninterest.|12782
[BK][BK]Some days its depressing, others you just do not feel.|12782
[BK][BK]I did not try again.|12782
I do not see the benefit really.|12782
I felt very calm and actually a little happy.|12782
Not because I lived, but because I saw my attempt out to the end and accepted death.|12782
"I think my first actual thought was 'Am I dead?'"""|12782
which is a question that I was not able to answer for awhile.|12782
I felt so disconnected from the world that I felt there was a chance I was dead and it was just a lucid dream.|12782
I have used the experience positively though.|12782
I do not fear for my life in any situation and I will give up everything I own to help out anybody else who is suffering because I already gave up my life, my suffering does not matter anymore.|12782
"I will always draw the short straw if the option is presented."""|12782
Thinking about it, I usually went to get something to eat.|12782
Except that time with the pills, I just keep throwing up and laying there.|12782
I cannot wear shorts in public any more.|12782
I was laying in the bath tub in my underwear, (I wanted to at least have those on when someone found me) and I was practically bathing in my own blood.|12782
I remember thinking to myself how shitty it was going to be for my family to find me, and the next I remember is my mom coming into the bathroom, then pulling out her cell phone to call an ambulance.|12782
"My first thought then, after realizing I was going to live through it, was 'Fuck I hate hospitals.'"""""|12782
Late to the party but oh well,[BK]I tried to overdose on a trip to Thailand last year.|12782
I got drunk on the room tab, went down to the street and bought some drugs from the shifty little pop-up stores that appear at night, and took them on my way back to the hotel, washed them down with vodka and a little mixer to make sure I would not throw up.|12782
I was feeling really emotional beforehand, as well as when I was back at the hotel wishing I could just die already, but actually planning it and going through with it was the most clarity I have ever experienced.|12782
I actually felt happy and excited that it was finally going to be over.|12782
I cut myself as well that evening, as well as writing to my best friend before I fell asleep.|12782
[BK]I woke up very late in the evening the next day, and just felt dread that I was still alive.|12782
The drugs had made me incredibly sleepy and my head felt so heavy I could barely move.|12782
I knew I now had to deal with the repercussions of what I would tried to do, how upset my friend was, and how the bloody sheets would be explained when I checked out.|12782
It was more of the fact that I felt frustrated that it would look like I was not serious, and that I had faked it like a teenage girl for attention.|12782
More and more things from the previous night started to come back to me, but all I wanted to do was just disappear still.|12782
I had wanted to die, not pointlessly upset and inconvenience everyone else.|12782
[BK][BK]Even now when things are finally better, the feelings and thoughts that led me to want to kill myself are still there, and I always wish I had died that night because then all the pain and suffering I will endure the rest of my life could have been avoided; the good parts are never really worth the bad parts.|12782
I have not wanted to kill myself since but I think that may be because I have not really been able to feel anything very strongly since; I am still sad, I am still happy, but never really passionately happy or devastated enough to try again yet.|12782
'WHY DID I DO THAT?!?!?|12782
WHAT THE FUCK WAS I THINKING?!?!|12782
"'""[BK][BK][BK]Quickly followed by a quick google search, '""do I need to get my stomach pumped if I did not die?'"". """|12782
I have had quite a few attempts over the years, from I was 8 and upwards (but next year it is 10 years since my last attempt) but the feeling after has varied.|12782
"[BK]Sometimes relief and hope that maybe I was not meant to die, sometimes fear that someone would know and find me before I got cleaned up, sometimes 'fuck it, this was not supposed to happen'""."|12782
Sometimes pure seething rage.|12782
I guess every reaction is a normal one.|12782

When my Aunt tried committing suicide, my mother (who has been a nurse most of her life) was so devastated seeing her older sister lying there dying that she went into shock and fell on the floor.|12782
She screamed for my dad, but I am the one who came running.|12782
I will never forget the tone of her voice when she screamed.|12782
I revived her since I am the only one that knew CPR/first aid besides my mom, and I kept her alive until the paramedics came.|12782
My mom stayed with her until she woke up, but I had to go to work.|12782
"She said the first thing she did was start to cry, and my aunts first words were '(twoheartedgal) is really mad at me is not she'""."|12782
I guess she remembered that I was the one who saved her, and felt ashamed.|12782
I made sure she knew I loved her no matter what.|12782
We''ve always been close and I just wanted her to be okay and happy.|12782
"She is much happier now, full of love, but it was a scary and dark time for a while."""|12782
"'Oh no I broke the door.'"""|12782
I had thrown a belt over the door and looped it on to the handle closed the door and hung myself.|12782
I hung for just a moment long enough to pass out.|12782
Next I am sitting in the floor choking and coughing fucked up from all the Pills I swallowed.|12782
"I had promised to lend my USB drive to a friend he showed up about 30 minutes after my attempt and got me to check myself in to a mental hospital."""|12782
My cousin succeeded in killing himself when we were teenagers (roughly 15 years ago).|12782
"I have always wondered if he instantly regretted it or not, especially since I know he probably had a few moments before he lost consciousness [Details (trigger warning)](/s 'He hung himself from a tree and basically strangled himself since it was not a snap-your-neck hanging; then taken off of life support after there was no brain activity detected after being in the hospital a few days'"")."|12782
It sounds like almost everybody here regretted it immediately and that confirmation has hit me hard today.|12782
"This may be the first time that I have gone past being '""teary-eyed'"" at a Reddit post and arrived at full-on tears."|12782
Thankfully, I am working from home today and I can let it out.|12782
"I think my sadness comes from wishing he would have reached out to me, and wishing he knew I would have done anything for him."""|12782
"'There goes my favorite tie.'"""""|12782
"My first thought was definitely 'if I do not dry off, I am gonna try again.'"""|12782
It was freezing outside.|12782
It was sick, but I laughed at myself for a solid two minutes.|12782
"I then went home."""|12782
The first time I tried to kill myself was ODing on pills.|12782
I went to bed hoping I would not wake up.|12782
When my mom woke me up in the morning I was confused and really sad.|12782
The next day at work (I work for my dad) and when I saw him I said hi and immediately went into the bathroom and cried I was 20.|12782
My dad has been working 14 hour days 6 days a week for one reason and one reason only.|12782
To support me and my mom.|12782
And realizing I tried to give up on him killed me on the inside.|12782
Through out the I cried atleast once an hour.|12782
Then I started thinking about my other relatives and my cousin at the time was only 8 and looks up to me like an older brother.|12782
I imagined my uncle at my funeral trying to explain to my cousin why I  did it and why I was dead.|12782
That hit me really hard.|12782
[BK][BK]A few years later I tried again.|12782
But this time on sleeping pills.|12782
I took 50 sleeping pills (2400mg).|12782
1200mg is considered extremely dangerous.|12782
And 50 pills was considered attempt suicide.|12782
So I took the pills and was on the brink of death and I knew it.|12782
I went almost completely blind.|12782
I could not see 2 feet in front of me and I could not walk more than 2 steps without collapsing to the ground.|12782
I could not see or feel anything.|12782
all I could hear was my dead weight body hitting the ground every time I fell.|12782
I managed to make it up the stairs and went to bed.|12782
I decided I am either going to wake up or not wake up.|12782
I went or bed.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up and I was forever grateful to be alive.|12782
Ever since then I have been a much happier person I have not thought about suicide since and I used to think about it all the time|12782
Ahh fuck I cannot move.|12782
[BK][BK]I was in the hospital for about 2 weeks semi-comatose.|12782
I could hear everything, if they propped my eyes open I could see it, but I had no voluntary control over my muscles.|12782
I did not chose active suicide.|12782
I choose to withhold life saving treatment.|12782
[BK][BK]When I woke up in the hospital and realized that I had been transported and then treated against my will, I was .... devastated.|12782
There is no other word.|12782
To think that you are at the finish line only to wake up at the starting line....[BK][BK]After the disappointment came the anger.|12782
[BK][BK]I had a valid living will and a healthcare proxy on file at the hospital and with my personal physician.|12782
The hospital knew about my living will and ignored it.|12782
They did not misplace or overlook it.|12782
Hospital records show that they reviewed it and did not act on it.|12782
[BK][BK]I feel strongly that they should have been charged with assault.|12782
But the District Attorney did not agree with me.|12782
[BK]|12782
When I was sixteen I wanted to kill myself, so I took a bunch of sleeping pills, locked my bedroom door and drifted off.|12782
The next morning I woke up.|12782
For a second I thought I was dead.|12782
Then I noticed everything around me was still the same.|12782
So I checked the packaging of the pills I took the night before.|12782
It turned out they were homeopathic.|12782
"I shrugged and thought to myself  'I guess life is not so bad.'"""""|12782
"'Bummer.'"""""|12782
"'I need help...'""[BK][BK]I had been dealing with a ton of bullying (because of my weight), had been very pubicly cheated on, and my ptsd (from sexual abuse) was rearing its ugly head."|12782
I had tried several different ways and somehow I always fucked it up.|12782
I had not taken enough pills, I did not cut deep enough, I could not hold myself underwater long enough, and I was a minor, so I could not get my hands on alcohol.|12782
After a while I became more depressed because of how unsuccessful I was, and realized I needed help.|12782
It was one of the hardest conversations I have ever had with my mom.|12782
[BK][BK]I was in the psych ward for about 2 and a half weeks, and honestly, it was the best thing thay could have happened to me.|12782
I learned how to cope, I made a lifelong friend, and I guess, I just did not feel alone anymore.|12782
While I still struggle with the urge to self-mutilate, (it was an addiction.|12782
"It was not to kill myself, but for the control) I have never tried again."""|12782
Suicide is never a success.|12782
Just saying.|12782
"'well i fucked this up too, guess i can only go up from here'"" ten years later ive never been more happier and successful."""|12782
Wow, a lot of these entries are hard for me to get through.|12782
This is really bracing stuff (not that I expected it to be light reading.)|12782
"'Try, try again.'"""""|12782
I failed at failing.|12782
Of course.|12782
[BK][BK]Note: That was 16 years ago and I am a very happy adult these days.|12782
I was disappointed in myself even more.|12782
[BK][BK]It has been a year since my attempt, and last month is what talked me out of it.|12782
My best friend commuter suicide, and that brought me to see what would come out of it for others.|12782
After graduating high school I was accepted into only one college.|12782
It was not my college of choice and I had only applied there at the behest of my guidance counselor.|12782
[BK] [BK]Turns out I would get a full scholarship and proceed to REALLY make a mockery of the school I attended.|12782
Long story short, I felt myself starting to slip into dour moods which did not fit my personality and sought counseling from the school who proceeded to never get back in touch with me.|12782
In hindsight the program was really mismanaged.|12782
[BK] [BK]ANYWAY.|12782
After not receiving any attention, help, out-reach, etc, I decided that my life really just was not worth continuing.|12782
"'Clearly, no one must care if I stay or go, so I might as well go.'"""|12782
[BK] [BK]Or so I thought.|12782
[BK] [BK]I tried to hang myself from a closet clothing bar with a belt tied into a tight loop.|12782
I hung long enough to lose consciousness, but the bar must have snapped because the next thing I remember I had fallen out of the closet and my clothing was literally everywhere.|12782
[BK] [BK]No one called me or came to check on the sound.|12782
"[BK] [BK]My immediate thought was, '""Fuck this."|12782
"I will make the world care about me.'"""|12782
[BK] [BK]Haven''t tried since.|12782
"[BK] [BK]Funny thing about the '""No one cares if I stay or go...'"" argument: if you might as well go, then you might as well stay by the same premise."""|12782
'What''s that smell?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Alcohol and pills."|12782
I had vomited all over my futon and passed out in it.|12782
Woke up 14 hours later with the worst migraine of my life and potential brain damage that has left me with migraines occurring much more frequently than before the attempt.|12782
Regardless, I got up and cleaned myself and my apartment and I am glad I am still here.|12782
[BK][BK]Sorry, no life flashing before my eyes or sudden realizations that everything could be fixed for me.|12782
"The closest to that was realizing that I was being a moron and a coward and generally just a dumbass kid who would probably be able to fix his issues if he tried just a little harder."""|12782
I was 17 and took 28 Prozac pills (it was all I had left).|12782
I sat on my bed while listening to my parents call me for dinner and waited to die.|12782
Absolutely nothing happened after 20 minutes.|12782
I got up and walked to the dining room wondering why I was not dead.|12782
I told my therapist later on and he said that Prozac is too safe to overdose on.|12782
I am so happy I am alive because I love my life and my family|12782
Alcohol and xanax make for a pretty forgettable night, but the next morning I resolved to tell my parents (I was 16 at the time) and get help.|12782
My first thought was how life was not so bad and I could fix everything if I tried.|12782
[BK][BK]I wrapped my head in a bed sheet and held a gun to my head.|12782
When I pulled the trigger, it seemed like a long time before anything happened.|12782
I realized I did not actually want to kill myself and I felt terrible because my mom would walk in to find her sons' brain splattered on the ceiling.|12782
It seemed like forever because the round was a squib and it was stuck halfway down the barrel.|12782
16 year old me had severe emotional issues and was on a ridiculous amount of bipolar, depression, and antipsychotic medications.|12782
One particular day, I was walking home with thoughts flooding my brain, normal high school drama shit, family turmoil, various other things.|12782
I do not remember much.|12782
I got home, no one was there.|12782
I overdosed on all my medications.|12782
I paced around the house for a while, then I started puking everywhere.|12782
I got scared, I called my neighbor and told her I needed help.|12782
She came, called my grandparents, called 911.|12782
I do not remember a whole lot of my grandparents, but I vaguely remember combating the EMTs.|12782
They got me strapped down, eventually.|12782
I was taken to the hospital in a helicopter, which I remember absolutely nothing of.|12782
[BK][BK]When I woke up, who knows how long later, my estranged dad was the only person there.|12782
I do not remember any conversation or even hugging or anything at all, just that he was there.|12782
It meant a lot, still.|12782
My dad had a tough upbringing with several suicide attempts of his own.|12782
He never had anyone to wake up to, and he wanted to make sure I never felt that.|12782
It''s a small moment I still cherish.|12782
I spent the next several weeks in a behavioral clinic with other kids of varying ages.|12782
A 13 year old girl who stole her grandma''s car, a seven year old who physically attacked her mom, biting, kicking, and most sad of all, a 5 year old boy who had tried to hang himself from a ceiling fan.|12782
"There were plenty of others, anorexic girls, self mutilaters (myself included), repeat visitors, 'delinquents.'"""|12782
I never wanted to see another place like that.|12782
I finished my program, took my pills, tried to be happy.|12782
[BK][BK]My Grampa had a heart attack a few months later and needed a quadruple bypass.|12782
I was so numbed on these meds, I was unable to respond with appropriate emotions, or any emotions at that.|12782
I decided that day to stop taking my medications.|12782
I worked hard to get my head in a stable place, but I got there.|12782
Some years later, I had a psychological evaluation that determined I had been misdiagnosed several times over and under treated for the actual problem I had.|12782
So, I had spent years on all kinds of medications that I knew were fucking me up, and they turned out to be completely unnecessary.|12782
[BK][BK]It will be ten years since that attempt in just a few months.|12782
I have been with my husband for 7 of those years.|12782
We have two daughters together, one is three and one is a month old.|12782
My battles with depression have never gone away, but life has value to me and I will not stop trying to get better.|12782
This year, I am hoping to find medications that actually do something helpful for me.|12782
"I desperately want to be well."""|12782
I tried to OD & my husband who had been asleep caught & stopped me.|12782
[BK][BK]Before I just knew I had to die.|12782
I was so ready.|12782
It felt like a dream almost where there was this calm chaos.|12782
I was just taking pill after pill and knew that this was it, the end.|12782
I had completely given up & was drained of any energy.|12782
[BK][BK]But when he stopped me it kindof snapped me back to reality.|12782
There was this strange mix of relief and yet despair.|12782
I did not really want to die I just needed the pain to go away.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]Then I spent the next two days nonstop throwing up... & being in the absolute worst pain of my life.|12782
seriously do not try to overdose.|12782
:(|12782
"I was uncontrollably angry that I still had to put up with 'this bullshit'"" still."|12782
"This bullshit referring to life. """|12782
'Shit...|12782
I am gonna be late for uni.'|12782
I woke up in the hospital after overdosing.|12782
Almost died, I was actually pretty close.|12782
At one point before I blacked out, the nurses were trying to force me to drink liquid charcoal to absorb the pills I took, because some of them shut down my gag reflex.|12782
Not sure if my stomach was pumped.|12782
Never asked.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up feeling aimless and hopeless.|12782
I had no idea what direction to go in after that.|12782
I had to stay in an in-patient mental health unit for a couple of weeks.|12782
I was borderline catatonic.|12782
I did not really eat, sleep, move, talk.|12782
Everything just felt fucking pointless.|12782
I was sad that my one (supposedly) guarenteed out had failed.|12782
I did not know how to pick up the pieces of my life that I had fucked up, and I  was terrified of facing the people I hurt emotionally.|12782
I remember my parents were really pissed off at first.|12782
They lectured me, but then they softened up and realized the level of desperation I felt.|12782
I was around 15, if I remember correctly.|12782
That was one of my five hospital visits that resulted in admission to the unit.|12782
'Fuck, I cannot even do this right?|12782
Next time I am drinking bleach.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]That whole '""down the river, not across'"" you heard as a kid does not matter if you do not get deep enough in the first place."|12782
"Despite there being a lot of blood I only needed a few stitches/ butterfly stitches - staring at those was infuriating."""|12782
I realized what a little insufferable bitch I was for trying to kill myself|12782
After what felt like the entire world being against me; I took three full bottles of Wellbutrin.|12782
It took a long time to take effect, and I had thought maybe my attempt did not work.|12782
But I definitely did start to feel it, and it scared the shit out of me.|12782
[BK] I was rushed to the hospital, but it seemed everything was literally moving so slow, and echoing as if I were in a tunnel.|12782
The last thing I remember at that point was the ER staff giving me oxygen.|12782
After that I pretty much had no memory of anything that had happened after for a solid month.|12782
[BK]I have not made another attempt since.|12782
"I guess what I had realized was, my life literally passing before my eyes was so much worse than what I felt was the 'need'"" to take it for."|12782
"[BK]"""|12782
I am 24 and female.|12782
I swallowed pills and laid down waiting to drift into my eternal slumber.|12782
When I woke up I was covered in my own vomit and was incredible dehydrated.|12782
I laid on the floor thoughtless for what seemed like hours.|12782
I felt like an empty vessel and I was filled with a deep sadness that I could not accomplish the simple task of ending my own life; I slipped back into a deep sleep and when I woke the second time I was greeted by a cat (I did not own a cat at the time).|12782
The cat purred and laid on my chest and together we just laid there waiting for the energy that comes with life to fill my lungs.|12782
Eventually I stood, cleaned myself up, showered and it is then I realized the seriousness of what happened.|12782
Never before had I attempted suicide and as I reflected on my suicidal actions I began to feel sick, ill. My legs gave out and I fell in the shower and began sobbing.|12782
After my shower I slept for two full days, hardly eating or sleeping.|12782
When I woke up I felt reborn.|12782
My life changed drastically and I began advocating for myself.|12782
The abuse I experienced as a child seemed conquerable and I took the first deep breath I have taken since being birthed into Earth's atmosphere.|12782
I felt no shame, I felt no obligation to others, I felt grounded in myself.|12782
A gift no counsellor or therapist could have ever given me.|12782
I felt strong and for the first time ever I began to understand myself and my existence.|12782
Suicide and I danced a tango and thankfully the dance did not lead to my death, but to a new beginning.|12782
I am still struggling with my mental wellbeing and the past abuse I have encountered haunts me, but it does get easier...|12782
Slowly, but it does.|12782
"'I should not have chickened out'""[BK]I have bipolar disorder, and I got really fucking sick of insane mania and crippling depression."|12782
I tried to get help, but literally no doctor wanted to treat me.|12782
[BK]So, Injected myself with an entire bottle of insulin, and took a sleeping pill.|12782
I started getting the shakes, and I had this nagging thought that I was going to become a vegetable, I saw my niece who was under a year old at the time, and I freaked out and told someone.|12782
The ambulance got there really quickly, like under ten minutes.|12782
I live in a nice area.|12782
[BK][BK]The next like 2 or 3 days I was in the ICU having my blood sugar tested every half hour or hour or something, and getting injected with sugar and forced to eat sugar.|12782
It sucked and my fingers were bruised and squeezed dry by the end of it.|12782
There was a nurse there who was really nice to me though, that kindness really meant something to me, like maybe not all of humanity totally sucks.|12782
[BK][BK]I think they only took me out of the psych ward because they needed the bed for someone else.|12782
"[BK][BK]I am as lost as ever. """|12782
Wondering whether or not anyone would find out.|12782
I tried to slit my wrists in my dorm room but a friend walked in shortly after.|12782
I was light headed and actually kinda giddy from blood loss but my first thought when I realized my friend was not going to let me bleed out was ' damn.|12782
"Can''t even do this right '""."|12782
It was much later in the evening after I got home that I realized that death , while still alluring, was not what I wanted.|12782
I was still woefully depressed, so depressed that I honestly felt my family would not care if I died and I really had no desire for life but...as I looked at my bandaged wrist I did not feel like suicide was the right choice for me.|12782
"Still battling depression 17 years later but I have never entertained the thought of suicide ever again. """|12782
I tried twice and failed.|12782
I am 16, and I tried last year and the year before, both around september/october.|12782
I took every pill I could find, including tons of benadryl so I could pass out and never wake up.|12782
I sat in my bed, and started crying because I was so afraid...|12782
I told my parents and they took me to the ER and everything.|12782
I had to stay at the hospital for a couple of days.|12782
Those days were incredibly painful, not just because of the after effects of the pills metabolizing in my body.|12782
The next time I tried, I cut my legs fairly deep, and took even more pills than I had before.|12782
A year had passed since last time, and this time I took a whole bottle of Ibuprofen, sleeping pills, and every pill I could possibly find (again).|12782
I barely remember what even happened, except for when my parents were trying to put my limp body in the car, and police, and an ambulance.|12782
It's all kind of vague still.|12782
I woke up in the ER again, and then after that they put me in a psych ward for a week.|12782
It was torture in there.|12782
The worst feelings I have ever felt in my life were in a locked room, alone, in a corner, crying...|12782
I do not even like to think about it.|12782
Now I am here, on tons of antidepressants, and always being watched.|12782
Haven't finished a year of school in two years, and now I am trying to get my shit together, and figure out why I am on this earth, and what I should do.|12782
Well, shit, how am I gonna explain the puke everywhere?|12782
I was 15 at the time, the week after I was in the psychiatric ward.|12782
I turned 16 when I was  in there.|12782
[BK][BK]When I tried to kill myself I took multiple handfuls of pills.|12782
All that I could find, but it mostly it consisted of advil and iron supplements (for my anemia).|12782
Then I drank till I could not stand up, laid in the shower puking and cutting.|12782
I ended with a double digit blood alcohol level and almost lost my liver from the toxicity of the iron and alcohol.|12782
Its lucky I survived.|12782
[BK][BK]When I finally sobered up by the next afternoon I just stared at the wall while my parents talked at me and cried.|12782
I hated myself.|12782
I could not get fucking suicide right.|12782
I felt blank.|12782
I was in shock (or catatonic?)|12782
for a few days.|12782
Im better now.|12782
But waking up and knowing you failed life and on top of that failed suicide, makes you leave the world and withdraw into your mind|12782
Honestly?|12782
It was the fact I survived.|12782
I was heartbroken, devastated.|12782
Not because of the people I hurt, but because I still hurt and I was still there when I did not want to be anymore.|12782
I could not understand what I did to deserve to still be here when I just wanted it all to end.|12782
I thought all those pills I swallowed would end me and they did not.|12782
[BK][BK]I am only 21, but after a traumatic childhood and the revelation months earlier before my suicide attempt that I was Bipolar, I did not want to be there anymore.|12782
I was tired of being strong and believing and hoping that it would get better in time when I had been hoping that for years.|12782
This happened 4 months ago.|12782
[BK][BK]It was very difficult to deal with in the aftermath because I realized it did not fix anything and I really scared the people close to me.|12782
And it was not an option for me anymore.|12782
And that was terrifying because Suicide was always looked at by me as that 'friend' who would be there still if I could not take it anymore.|12782
And I no longer had that, because I survived.|12782
[BK][BK]The experience itself changed my life for better or worse because it was the first time I had actually TRIED and nearly succeeded when I had never acted on the thoughts before that moment in time.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not know what kept me here, but I am happy I stuck around because life has finally started to shape into the way I wanted it to be.|12782
It's still unpredictable, my mental illness (which by the way, turned out to be co-morbid with Borderline Personality Disorder as well) is never going to go away, and I need to address incidents of the past in therapy...but I am truly feeling as if I can forgive the past for hurting me so much and move on and look at the present more.|12782
people describe it as an amalgamation of relief and despair.|12782
i would say that anyone who wants to commit suicide is not capable of analysing their situation rationally, let alone after a failed attempt.|12782
[BK][BK]if they believe they can or could, they are lying.|12782
[BK][BK]at the point of suicide most people are emotionally deprived or saturated, based on how i understand the theory.|12782
[BK][BK]empathising with this, i assume the position of myself when i feel angry or depressed.|12782
not much is going on in my head other than the cause of the problem and the problem itself.|12782
"in other words, 'i am aware that i am depressed'"", '"" i do not like it that i am depressed'"", '""i feel depressed, because of x'""."|12782
"not '""i feel depressed, let me write down exactly what my thoughts are so that i can reflect on them later, productively'"", because i simply do not feel like doing anything at all."|12782
[BK][BK]translating this to suicidal tendencies, i assume that most people are not documenting their experiences and feelings.|12782
"they just think that they want to die."""|12782
When I woke up from overdosing on every pill I had in the house (I created an overdose basket and put it under my sink in preparation for another low), I felt angry that my mother was in the same room because we did not have a relationship at that time and I did not understand why she was there.|12782
I was angry that I was hooked up to machines.|12782
I remember getting up at one point and going to the bathroom against the doctors orders.|12782
Im not usually angry and Im not usually defiant.|12782
[BK][BK]After the dizziness and anger wore off, I was extremely sad.|12782
Sadder than I ever was.|12782
I felt like I failed and living, and also failed at dying.|12782
I wanted to die so much.|12782
At the point I was in, thinking about dying was the only thing that made me smile.|12782
I tried to negotiate my way out of hospital care but I was stuck.|12782
[BK][BK]I got out of the hospital early because my insurance did not approve the stay.|12782
They offered to let me transfer to a different facility or release me to see a counselor daily.|12782
Of course I elected to leave.|12782
I should have went to the other facility.|12782
[BK][BK]I went home to an empty house and I was lost.|12782
I tried to overdose again but just fell asleep and woke up much later.|12782
I figured if I had to live, I needed to learn how to do it.|12782
[BK][BK]I was assigned a psychiatrist that did not really treat me.|12782
She gave me way to many prescriptions and did not choose to listen.|12782
I gave up going to her and tried to just learn to be happy.|12782
[BK][BK]Here I am, 8 years later, now going to therapy and finally recovering.|12782
I know looking back, my progress stalled because I didnt take the right steps to getting better.|12782
I needed to create a web of support and the right kind of support for me.|12782
Im still going through highs and lows, but its been about 4 years since my last attempt.|12782
Ive found things to live for and Im starting to love myself.|12782
[BK][BK]It isnt easy, and it isnt fun at times.|12782
I catch myself planning things around the house or putting limits on how long Im going to live.|12782
Im married now and he is very understanding without accepting.|12782
His brother recently committed suicide so I was able to see how the pain transfers.|12782
It has been one of the hardest things we have gone through together.|12782
[BK][BK]Please reach out.|12782
If you dont like your therapist, try a new one that may fit your needs better.|12782
Never give up on yourself.|12782
A very close friend...[BK][BK][BK]'Damn.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]-  DuB(20$ak)"""|12782
Fuck why'd I tell my therapist.|12782
When I was about 16 I decided to take every pill in the house.|12782
I was choking them down by the handful and chased it down with some nyquil so I would fall asleep before I started to vomit.|12782
[BK][BK]I remember my dad called before I started to fight the sleep, and slurring that I was glad the I got to talk to him but I had to go now.|12782
[BK][BK]Obviously I woke up the next morning, and my first thoughts were terrible.|12782
I felt like I was such a failure the I could not even kill myself right.|12782
Then I felt incredibly stupid because what I had taken was not even close to lethal.|12782
Some 75 advil, a package of dramamine and a blister pack full of little red pills, I should have chugged the drano under the sink instead.|12782
[BK][BK]My mom took me to the doctor that morning because my friend told the school what I would done, and I was not given a moments privacy for a while, so I obviously did not go back to correct my mistakes.|12782
[BK][BK]I am glad for it now, my life is not great but it is what I got.|12782
[BK][BK]Especially now.|12782
My older brother died 2 years ago, and my dad does not know how close he came to having me kill myself 12 years ago.|12782
I thought I would be less of a burden if I went but after my brother's death, which was not a suicide, I would know that I would haunt this family for fucking ever.|12782
[BK][BK]|12782
I am not a suicide survivor but I saved someone attempting to commit suicide.|12782
I was out for a fun with a friend and we saw a gentleman lying  under some trees.|12782
There is always an assumption that it will be a drunk person but we checked it out anyway and he had fastened a cord around his neck and was clearly asphyxiating.|12782
His lips were blue, eyes bulging, was twitching, he had clearly been crying and was in a bad way.|12782
I tried to remove the cord while my friend phoned an ambulance but it was digging deep into his neck so I cut it off with a penknife.|12782
As he came to he started fighting me, he really did not want the cord taking off.|12782
His first thought was that he wanted to be left alone to die.|12782
When he slowly started to come around properly he tried to get up and run away but could not stand and I had to gently restrain him (he was so weak a hand on the shoulder was enough).|12782
[BK][BK]I kept talking to him while we waited for help to arrive and when he finally filly regained consciousness he was ashamed and embarrassed at what he had done and kept apologising profusely for letting us see him this way.|12782
For me the most depressing part came afterwards, he was whizzed away in an ambulance and we never founs out how he was or what happened to him.|12782
[BK][BK]It was the day after Father's Day so that may have had something to do with his suicide attempt but I do not think we will ever know.|12782
I am just glad we were running along a deserted bit of the river at the time or he would have died without a doubt.|12782
Im 20, I have been thru a lot in life.|12782
Going through four suicides my senior year of high school.|12782
I have lost 6 people to suicide.|12782
October 31st 2015, i was supposed to go camping with some friends, I was not going to go to the party.|12782
I had this gut wrenching feeling something bad was going to happen.|12782
But al my friends ditched me and I went to that party.|12782
I find happiness when I drink and i needed some that night.|12782
I told myself I am just gonna drink as much as possible because i do not care what can happen.|12782
I woke up in the hospital, the medics said they thought i was dead arriving on the scene.|12782
I still sometimes wish to this day that i would have just died.|12782
Its always in the back of my mind on a daily basis.|12782
I try my best to stay afloat.|12782
My car an 88 gl10 subaru sedan is really the only thing that has been keeping me alive.|12782
Im a subaru ambassador so I got that gong for me.|12782
It still sucks though never knowing exactly when this depression shit is gonna just quit.|12782
It'd be cool to just have someone that knows exactly what it feels like to lose your aunt or friend to suicide all within a couple months apart.|12782
Its been two years since my aunts suicide and I have yet to bring myself to go visit her at her grave.|12782
I want to so bad but I just cannot.|12782
Ive been telling myself that Im alright but truly I am still broken....|12782
Fuck I am gonna fail this final|12782
I took 97, 50 mg sleeping pills.|12782
I was ready to go and be done with all the sadness that my heart just could not handle anymore.|12782
I spent 3 days on a ventilator as my lungs and kidneys stopped working.|12782
And for 3 days the Dr.''s asked my family if they wanted to pull the plug because they did not believe I would wake up.|12782
"Each time my family said, 'No, he is going to wake up!'""."|12782
And then I did.|12782
Outwardly I was so sorry for what I put everyone thru.|12782
They were all so sad and shocked and did not know what to think and so glad that I was still here.|12782
"But truthfully, my first thought was, '""Why am I still here?'""."|12782
By all rights I should be dead.|12782
I do not want to be here.|12782
Why?|12782
I went to counseling and did a lot of soul searching and about 6 months ago it was revealed to me why I was still here.|12782
I am a singer/songwriter and I knew that I had the opportunity to speak for those who did not have such a platform.|12782
So I decided to write a song about suicide.|12782
Then I decided to make a music video for suicide prevention.|12782
I can relate to every person who has ever thought about suicide or even tried it.|12782
I have been there and I made it.|12782
And most importantly, I overcame it.|12782
I am still here and I get to help other people, just like me, every single day.|12782
It gets better, I promise you that.|12782
To anyone on the fence, sit and talk with me awhile.|12782
I will not blow smoke up your butt, the answers are NEVER easy.|12782
It''s NOT the cowards way out.|12782
But there is a better way.|12782
We are each gifted and so special in our own ways, we just need to recognize that our value is not based on upon other peoples perceptions of our worth.|12782
[BK][BK]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq56VDonz5I[BK][BK]Here''s the link to the video.|12782
If you or someone you know is suicidal, watch this or share it and follow the links to get help.|12782
If you just want to help, ALL the money from the sales of this song are donated back into various suicide prevention organizations.|12782
I do not make a dime from this, I just want to help people and let you know that I want you to stick around.|12782
Please, stay.|12782
"If no one has told you today, you matter. """|12782
Two years ago I was really drunk and high and ran into the middle of a street right around a curve.|12782
I blacked out and woke up laying next to the street crying with my best friend and a few others standing around me.|12782
Immediately after I was so upset that it had not worked and that I was still living.|12782
Inside the house I went to the bathroom and cut myself all over my arm and fell asleep.|12782
The next morning I woke up in the room with my best friend.|12782
The first thing I said was.|12782
"'I am glad I am still alive'"" and she said '""me too'"" and we hugged."""|12782
Well I got really drunk and took some pills like a lot at least looking back it seemed like a lot then I woke up, and well was in disbelief and a lot of pain, then I had to hide it so no one would know what happened and I went horse back riding a little more than an hour later.|12782
'I cannot do anything right, can I?|12782
Guess I am stuck here.|12782
I will just make the most of it.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Turns out I did not have the pain tolerance, or at least the conviction necessary to overwhelm my pain sensation."|12782
So my biology saved me.|12782
Or it damned me...|12782
"But that depends how I rate the quality of the years since it happened."""|12782
When I tried to kill myself, I was 16.|12782
I stole two bottles of pills from my dad's cabinet, and after 5th period at school that day, I swallowed them all.|12782
I felt I was storming into the front line of battle.|12782
I was a vulnerable solider, unarmed and disoriented, but I knew could no longer hide in the bushes, I must strike fast and hard, all the while knowing that I would be struck down, like Butch Cassidy.|12782
But at least the waiting would end.|12782
When I woke up the next morning, I felt I arose to silent wreckage, but that I had miraculously made it through, and that it may be possible to win the war.|12782
Honestly ?[BK][BK]'Fuck.|12782
One MORE thing I cannot even get right.|12782
How much shit is THIS going to bring me?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]It''s been over a decade and not a week goes by where I do not wish I would succeeded."|12782
But equally, not a week goes by where I have the courage to try again.|12782
[BK][BK]I spend a lot of hours dreaming of / fantasising about being murdered or dying in a disaster and my family living well off of my insurance.|12782
[BK][BK]People say that suicide is a way out for cowards.|12782
Most of those people have never truly faced their mortality.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: oh, and I do not consider my self a survivor.|12782
I associate that term with people who beat something that they had to struggle against.|12782
You survive cancer.|12782
You survive a heart attack.|12782
"You fuck up a suicide."""|12782
'Fuck.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]The same thing i said every morning I woke up."|12782
[BK][BK]I was a very belligerent drunk.|12782
I was in a real dark place and drank myself to blackout every night for three months.|12782
Sometimes I would hope that in my drunken state, I would take my life.|12782
There was numerous times that I woke up to messages from friends saying they were worried about me because I was in a state of madness and was cursing allowed, yelling about how fucked up my head was and that I was going to kill myself.|12782
[BK][BK]One night I had enough.|12782
There was a few events that took place that day that pushed a bit further than before.|12782
From what I remember I had 5 jager bombs, and a pitcher of beer.|12782
I was with two coworkers playing pool and thankfully they looked after me, even though I was being selfish and making a scene.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up the next morning face down in a pile of vomit in my bed.|12782
My head felt like someone took a barbed wire bat to my head.|12782
I looked at my phone to see I was three hours late to work and had several missed calls and texts from coworkers.|12782
[BK][BK]Long story short, I had a mental breakdown with my parents about my behavior and the twisted thoughts that plagued my mind.|12782
I was checked into the hospital and was placed in the mental ward for suicide watch and to monitor my alcohol level.|12782
I had my blood drawn every four hours and had my vitals tested every two hours.|12782
[BK][BK]I have recently came to appreciate life.|12782
"I still struggle with ptsd and depression, but with the help of marijuana I am able to get some sleep without being plagued my nightmares."""|12782
I woke up in my grandmother's bathroom covered in vomit and piss to banging on the door.|12782
Blurred vision.|12782
I do not remember my first thought.|12782
I remember hating myself for failing as I cleaned the floor though.|12782
I had an acquaintance from high school try to kill himself by shooting himself in the chest.|12782
The round squibbed, meaning it misfired and the round was stuck in the barrel.|12782
He assumed because he saw a bit of smoke and heard a quiet pop, that he was dying and was euphoric since he did not feel anything.|12782
Nope, round failed to do anything.|12782
He realized what happened and instead of being angry, was relieved and decided he wanted to live rather than his mom come home and find his body in a pool of blood.|12782
He cleared the squibbed round, cleaned the gun and called a doctor.|12782
[BK][BK]I never told him, but I shoot guns and have since I was a young kid and I have seen or shot hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition and it was not until this past August that I saw a round squib.|12782
At the point he told me of the attempt, I had yet to see it happen.|12782
'I feel like shit.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Apparently I had my stomach pumped while I was unconscious."|12782
I took a handful of hydros and downed some vodka and started wandering the streets.|12782
I was aware if I died at home that no one would find me.|12782
Passed out walking down a sidewalk, and some good Samaritan called an ambulance.|12782
[BK][BK]Long story short, no one knows.|12782
When asked where I was, I just say I was out of town for a card tournament and a convention.|12782
Not even my best friend knows because I am afraid she will be upset that I broke our promise.|12782
"We promised each other that should we make an attempt on our own lives, we will tell each other first."""|12782
First time: I NEED TO USE THE MALE RESTROOM WHY WONT YOU LET ME USE IT?!|12782
[BK][BK]Second time: Thank god, that would have been a shitty way to go.|12782
I should have just drank some robitussin instead.|12782
Ok so this seems like the perfect place to get some info and advice.|12782
[BK][BK]So my girlfriend's parents are getting divorced.|12782
It all started when they caught her dad cheating.|12782
In all the fighting mess he said he never really loved her and was just waiting for the kids to grow up.|12782
I believe this, based on how depressed he always seemed.|12782
But on to the part where I need advice.|12782
Her mom has tried to commit suicide twice in the past couple weeks, is a complete mess emotionally, and is crazy depressed.|12782
My gf has tries to help but just gets frustrated because her mom will not listen to any advice or do anything to better herself, in fact she is actively making her life harder by not going to work and not paying bills.|12782
My question is what do you say or do to help someone who has completely given up?|12782
It's like the only thing on her mind is how she can get away with killing herself.|12782
"'Why did I stop'"" [BK][BK]Shortly after realizing that I had survived my suicide attempt, I tried to better myself by reading book and playing video games."|12782
But that did not last very long.|12782
[BK][BK]About two months later after my first suicide attempt, I tried to do it again for personal reasons.|12782
And those reasons I did not have control over.|12782
I was alone through the whole trip.|12782
I did not have anyone.|12782
I was not a complete loner, I had friends that I would socialize with and hang out with, but none of them knew how I was truly feeling.|12782
[BK][BK]After my third attempt, I decided to tell one of my close friends that I have attempted suicide on three different occasions.|12782
"She just laughed and said, '""do not be a bitch, grow a pair'"" after that I became more revert."|12782
I stopped hanging out, I stopped going out to parties.|12782
I was completely alone.|12782
I had no idea what to do, I did not know what to do.|12782
I gave myself support for all these years and thoughtout high school I made, maybe two more suicide attempts.|12782
[BK][BK]Shortly after my freshman year of high school, I met a girl that helped me cope with all this pain and she understood everything.|12782
She did not tell me to kill myself, she did not berate me, she supported me all the way.|12782
I would sometimes call her in the middle of the night crying my eyes out because I was feeling depressed and she would help me.|12782
[BK][BK]Come sophomore year, she passed away in a car crash.|12782
I was absolutely devastated.|12782
The only person that has ever helped me has just passed away and I was alone again.|12782
I stayed alone for another 2 years.|12782
I made it through by thinking about what she said and how to keep going and not stay in the past.|12782
[BK][BK]Now, I have a close friend that truly helps me out a lot.|12782
She is talked me out of 2 suicide attempts and I forever thankful for her support.|12782
"I do not know where I would be without her support or my long time friend. """|12782
I attempted to kill myself by using a knife and cutting open my stomach.|12782
I am guessing whereever I stabbed did not cause enough damage to actually kill me or make me faint from blood loss and just die from lack of blood.|12782
When I realized I was not going to die soon from this I tried to move the knife around more to cause more damage, but the pain was too much for me to bear.|12782
"I kept crying and shouting 'I cannot even do this right'""."|12782
Eventually one of the neighbors heard my shouting and complained to the apartment  staff.|12782
They found me in my bathroom covered in blood still shouting the same thing over and over and called an ambulance.|12782
When I finally was able to put some rational thought to it, I cried and was unable to process things really.|12782
I thought myself to be the failure who could not even leave this world correctly.|12782
It has been 2 years since then.|12782
Honestly some days are still pretty bad and other are good.|12782
"The future is world completely unknown and I am just hoping that the good days will start to outweigh the bad ones."""|12782
"'I am sorry'""[BK][BK]I am not a sociable person."|12782
I keep small friend groups to avoid drama, and to not disappoint a lot of people when I move after community college.|12782
In a result of this, I have had a total of five really close friends.|12782
Everyone else in my eyes was an ''acquaintance'' of some sort, someone that I just ''Knew''.|12782
I would not think twice about having a personal conversation with them.|12782
[BK][BK]I had lost my last good friend to a car accident.|12782
To add onto that?|12782
Every single one of them died from car accidents within a three year span, all in the same general area, all due to high speed leading to fishtailing.|12782
[BK][BK]None of the other deaths affected me.|12782
I was genially worried after the third of five close friends passed without me shedding a single tear.|12782
This lead to Insomnia, which led to my doctor prescribing me sleep aid, as well as referring me to a therapist.|12782
[BK][BK]I tried overdosing on sleeping pills.|12782
Not to an extreme amount, but still enough to where I had a possibility of dying in my sleep (I do not remember much of the previous few hours of taking them, so I could not tell you the exact amount).|12782
I decided if I woke up still alive, it was a sign to keep pushing through life.|12782
[BK][BK]When I woke up the day after, everything seemed a lot brighter than usual.|12782
Not brighter like the sun was out without clouds, but like if you were to play a video game and turn the contrast and brightness way too high.|12782
I assumed this was the afterlife, but due to me not having any religious views, I did not know what would happen.|12782
None of that mattered though, because the only thing I could think about was how sorry I was.|12782
[BK][BK]I had family, and no matter the fact I isolated myself from most of them, they all loved me.|12782
If I was dead, they would not have spoken to me since my graduation of high school.|12782
These ''Acquaintances'' I had thought of themselves more than that to me.|12782
Although I did not believe it, they did care about me.|12782
Worst of all was that I had refused to communicate with my mother for the past three months.|12782
For what reason?|12782
I have no idea.|12782
One day I just decided I was tired of hearing her voice, and just stopped making effort to communicate with her.|12782
[BK][BK]Eventually, I did come to me senses, and the ''brightness'' went down.|12782
I realized I was still in my room (although for some reason I was on the floor), and I got up oddly feeling normal.|12782
My life did not flash through my eyes, and I did not meet god or anything.|12782
I got ready for classes, and went to them.|12782
[BK][BK]Although nothing noteworthy besides the sorry thoughts happened, I took in a lot from those thoughts.|12782
That day I went to my mothers house and spent the day with her, and have been doing that weekly.|12782
I have reached out to small friends and have developed relationships with them, even starting dating someone.|12782
[BK][BK]That all happened six months ago.|12782
I did not talk to my councilor about it, and when my doctor asked why I needed a refill so early on my sleep aid, I told him I accidentally lost half the bottle down the drain.|12782
The whole event stayed in the back of my mind till this thread came up, which I took as an opportunity to share my experience.|12782
I want everyone to know that suicide is not the answer.|12782
There are always people who you can reach out to, and always a solution.|12782
A temporary problem should not be solved by a permanent fate.|12782
"[BK][BK]Stay strong everyone!"""|12782
I became aware of the beeping and the volume of distant murmurs turning up, and I looked around and was startled by the look of concern on the nurse's face.|12782
I felt immediately like trying to calm her but I sort of disappeared back into myself for a bit.|12782
The thing is you can never be sure whether you succeeded or not, that to me is reason enough not to do it, lotta people do not tell you that|12782
For me my thoughts were moving too quick to really pick out any one thought.|12782
If anything I would say the first feeling was a bit of soul crushing relief knowing that the pressures of my life had just passed me by.|12782
I was no longer on track to be a college grad, or get married, or be financially stable.|12782
I could take life one day at a time and no matter how bad it got at least I was still alive.|12782
I had a .22 revolver to my head.|12782
When I pulled the trigger I heard the click.|12782
Then I realized that I heard the fucking click.|12782
I was not laying in a pool of my own blood at my desk but I was fully awake and aware that I heard the sound of the hammer hitting the round.|12782
[BK][BK]I sat there for a minute with the gun to my head before lowering it and pulling the cylinder.|12782
I checked the bullet and the rim was dented.|12782
The hammer had made contact but it did not fire.|12782
It was in that moment I thought 'Have I cheated Death or did Death cheat me?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I have had a much different outlook since then."|12782
I realized I was mortal, I should have been dead but somehow I made it out alive.|12782
From then on I lived a little more.|12782
Anything from that point forward was a bonus on the life I was going to have.|12782
I bought a motorcycle, I left my controlling girlfriend.|12782
I went to the strip club and blew $1500 in a night.|12782
I have lived.|12782
"I have lived more in the 3 years since than I did in the 24 years prior."""|12782
How can you fail suicide?|12782
I think the people dont really want to die or why do they not just jump in front of a train or jump down a high building?|12782
I dont want to be mean.|12782
That's something to improve on next time so this does not happen.|12782
I felt bad for myself.|12782
I do not have to say anything.|12782
[BK][BK]I was about 12-13 and was bullied heavily where I went to school.|12782
Went through puberty before everyone else, was tall and fat, had an abusive childhood and was ultimately robbed of happiness.|12782
One night I tied my belt around my neck and looped it to the support beam in the basement.|12782
[BK][BK]The belt snapped, I fell to the ground and gasped for air.|12782
I felt like everyone was right, I am fat.|12782
I did not want to go upstairs to my abusive family either.|12782
I wanted to be hanging from the belt where I could have been happier.|12782
[BK][BK]Fast forward, I used the depression at fuel to change my life and do a 180.|12782
Sometimes I go back down a dark path, but I can usually redirect it elsewhere.|12782
I was really, really scared.|12782
"The police were there, and I was scared that this was now going to become a huge thing and I would not be able to 'finish the job,'"" if you will."|12782
They took me to the hospital, and I was completely helpless.|12782
I could not leave.|12782
Everything in me just wanted to be done and here I kept having to take tests and talk to person after person, and it was completely up to these nameless people when I would be allowed to walk out of there.|12782
I was dead set on saying and doing whatever I had to in order to be discharged and pick a better vehicle to come to completion.|12782
[BK][BK]Turns out there is a reason for keeping people against their will.|12782
After a couple days, I changed my mind.|12782
Decided to work on myself and try to find something within me to keep alive.|12782
"9 years this last March and counting, thanks to our boys in blue. """|12782
'Where the fuck am I?|12782
A HOSPITAL??|12782
WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING HERE?!?!?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I do not really remember the suicide attempt, or even the choice."|12782
It was by alcohol.|12782
I was blackout drunk already.|12782
[BK][BK]I would been dealing with several months of hardcore sleep deprivation.|12782
I got a few reprieves but it went something like 1-2 hours of very fragmented sleep a night.|12782
The rest of it was just drowsiness but no sleep.|12782
Every night.|12782
Every fucking night.|12782
Worst stretch was 4 weeks of this.|12782
[BK][BK]First went my fine motor skills.|12782
[BK]Then gross motor skills.|12782
[BK]Then judgment.|12782
[BK]Then mood.|12782
[BK]Then complete mental state.|12782
I do not just mean stability but conscious perception started getting fucked.|12782
[BK][BK]And the physical misery.|12782
Boy!|12782
"You know those charts they keep in a hospital '""How''s your pain today?'"""|12782
"0-10 where 10 is screaming agony unable to respond the pain is overwhelming, 9 is close, 8 is fucking miserable mate.... so on....[BK][BK]Imagine the same scale but '""intense physical discomfort'"" without any actual sensation of pain."|12782
I was probably a 9 on such a scale.|12782
My hands were the wrong shape and muscles attached every which way, all of them wrong.|12782
The world spun in peculiar and decidedly unpleasant ways and I generally felt the worst sensations of physically being on a very large roller coaster.|12782
Finger spasms non stop, same with legs.|12782
Sometimes unable to even hold a pencil.|12782
Sometimes unable to walk.|12782
I had very little direct control over my muscles by that point.|12782
Taken to ER twice for what appeared to be a seizure.|12782
Wasn''t.|12782
[BK][BK]All from sleep deprivation.|12782
[BK][BK]To be clear my body was putting me through shit normally reserved for when the CIA really wants to tear a human being apart.|12782
[BK][BK]Worst time of my life, and that is saying a lot.|12782
[BK][BK]A few times after this I was very suicidal but thankfully was under supervision.|12782
When your existence is that wretchedly .... well.... wretched.... you just do not want to live anymore.|12782
Not like that.|12782
Dear God not like that.|12782
[BK][BK]All sorted now.|12782
Very happily.|12782
Easily too, though I fear the vague possibility of a world where these two simple medications are no longer available to me.|12782
"Not likely though."""|12782
"'When the fuck am I gonna finally be able to die'""[BK][BK]Still think that today"""|12782
I think being in a suicide facility shut out from everyone you know is the worst part of my attempt though and being roomed with a woman who reminded me and favored my grandmother who passed away two years prior was torture Alone.|12782
I weigh about 115 and swallowed 16 600mg ibuprofen pills and they did not work but I practically felt dead being shoved into that facility where you cannot try again and  you are stuck  being alone with the thoughts that put you there to begin with.|12782
But seeing everyone else in there made me realize I want to help others see a better light to life I just wanted to add this.|12782
Woke up in the hospital being babysat by an obese old lady.|12782
First thought was GODDAMNIT I FAIL AT EVERYTHING.|12782
I tried ripping out my IV, my catheter (I am female), and everything attached.|12782
I was unconscious for 3 days.|12782
Took 100+ klonopins plus a half a bottle of Tylenol.|12782
After that first thought, I passed out again and woke up in the psych ward.|12782
I was on a hold for 3 days.|12782
[BK][BK]I want to try again.|12782
I am just scared of 1) it not working again and 2) seeing the faces of my family AGAIN after failing.|12782
[BK][BK]So, I will not try.|12782
I am just fucking miserable.|12782
'Fuck, I am not going to die.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]About three years ago I took a lot of pills, somewhere around 120."|12782
What I did not think through was the fact my body was going to reject them, and I started vomiting uncontrollably.|12782
I got really scared; I worried I was not going to die, but something bad was going to happen and I would have to live with it.|12782
So I went to the hospital, had to have activated charcoal put in my stomach via feeding tube(?)|12782
and then a day or two later I woke up.|12782
I spent a few days after that in the hospital because they were monitoring me for serotonin syndrome and I also had to wait to talk to a social worker because I was under 18 at the time.|12782
That whole experience is a bit of a blur and I honestly do not really think about it anymore and nobody besides my family who was around at the time know.|12782
[BK][BK]What I do know is that the most painful part of the whole experience was seeing how it affected my family.|12782
"Because of that alone I would never try it again, but I would be lying if I said I am glad I was unsuccessful."""|12782
*Holy fucking shit, this is the most pain I have ever been in and it is amazing.|12782
*[BK] [BK] [BK]After my mom had a brain hemorrhage, I took over handling the bills, food, etc.|12782
while going to school and driving to/from the hospital every night for months.|12782
Those months seemed like years, and I felt nothing but loneliness.|12782
"There came a point when I did not think she would come out of her coma and I was like, 'fuck all of this.'"""|12782
Now, the pills caused so much pain as they tore up my insides; I have an allergy to that medication (like the medical version of severe nut allergy) so my body went into massive shock, rejected everything and made me pay for it for weeks.|12782
[BK] [BK] [BK]The pain was so intense.|12782
It was the first thing I had felt in so long, and it was a major wakeup call.|12782
Life hurts.|12782
***Life*** hurts; death is just nothing, no feeling or desire, or anything at all.|12782
I wanted to feel so badly, and the pain was enough to make it seem real again.|12782
"[BK] [BK]*sorry for mobile formatting[BK] [BK] [BK]Edit: allergy clarification"""|12782
When I woke up I was really REALLY fucked up, but in a high way not a bad way and I really enjoyed it.|12782
I am really hard on the alcohol now.|12782
I still get suicidal at times but I just hit the liquor store.|12782
It does not remove the pain or thoughts but it mutes them temporarily which is enough to get on with the next day.|12782
"My first conscious thought was 'Damn this shit feels good.'"""|12782
I did not even think about not having succeeded.|12782
The second time I do not remember, I woke up in the hospital and the police told me I could go home after I went to jail.|12782
"Currently on probation."""|12782
For those who suffer from depression as I did for over a decade, there is hope!|12782
[MAPS](http://www.maps.org/research) is working with the FDA doing clinical trials with various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, Ibogaine, and Ayahuasca, for use with psychotherapy in order to treat a variety of psychological and emotional problems including PTSD, trauma, anxiety, depression, and addiction.|12782
These trails have been working extremely well with success rates higher than that of traditional treatments.|12782
They plan on legalizing MDMA for prescribed use by 2021 and I would expect the legalization of the others to follow not long after.|12782
I recommend taking a look at their site where they have promising research on these substances, as well as others.|12782
The first one I can clearly remember was 'Now what?'|12782
My answer saved my life from then on out, 'I am alive'.|12782
Every day since I wake up and remind myself of at least one reason I need to live.|12782
In the beginning, there were days I could only find one.|12782
It got easier as life got fuller.|12782
My only advice, talk with someone, those ideas are not normal.|12782
Depression is serious and all day sadness is not normal.|12782
Ask for help.|12782
Fuck!|12782
Why did I beg my boyfriend to call an ambulance?|12782
[BK][BK]I was mad at myself that I panicked and did not just let myself drift off to sleep from the pills I took.|12782
Thank Gods|12782
Last year was a bad period of my life.|12782
I attempted suicide multiple times yet I am still alive.|12782
Apparently I really suck at it.[BK][BK]'Goddammit.|12782
"What the fuck?'"""|12782
Was my response when the rope I was using to hang myself broke.|12782
It was disappointing to say the least.|12782
"[BK][BK]'""Holy shit, I am alive."|12782
"This sucks,'"" followed by, '""Cops will be here soon and they are going to make me explain things.'"""|12782
I decided to end my life while driving, which I enjoy very much when I am not trying to commit suicide.|12782
Drank copious amounts of alcohol and took a handful of pills to prepare myself for it.|12782
I picked a wooded area with a large drop from the road so there would be plenty of things to run into.|12782
At this point I unbuckled my seatbelt, got my speed up to around 60 and jerked the wheel.|12782
I wake up in the rear cargo area of my small SUV, covered in water, glass, and superficial cuts and bruises.|12782
Being arrested later really rubbed salt in the wound.|12782
"[BK][BK]'""Why am I covered in blood, urine and vomit?"|12782
"Oh yeah...'"" My final attempt was on October 4, 2015."|12782
I decided to give myself a fatal dose of IV Heroin but it did not give me the results I desired.|12782
[BK][BK]Things have gotten significantly better since my last attempt and I would not consider myself suicidal anymore.|12782
"That was also the last time I used opiates so life is good and getting better at the moment."""|12782
I am going to be wearing long sleeves for a very long time.|12782
My thoughts on suicide...people always seem to default to you being depressed.|12782
I do not think that was ever the case with me.|12782
Sometimes, life sucks and it is a calculated logical decision.|12782
You are doing it out of compassion for yourself, to end pain and suffering.|12782
Like shooting a deer that has been hit by a car.|12782
When I was 14 I tried to hang myself with a vacuum cleaner cord( I know stupid of me to think that would work).|12782
My weight broke through it while I was slipping out of consciousness and sliced my neck up pretty badly.|12782
I felt regret immediately when I came to because one I had failed, and two my parents were in shambles about it.|12782
That was 3 years ago and I am still in that mental state, it has not gotten any better.|12782
Part of which is because I have beaten cancer once, I had a small cancerous tumor in my leg, but I currently have a non-cancerous brain tumor that causes some crazy headaches.|12782
There's a lot more to my life story that brought me down this path, I am hoping university will help me and that my tumor would just not be there anymore.|12782
I came out of a really bad fight with the folks.|12782
I tried to OD and apparently in my state I ended up calling my girlfriend.|12782
"She took care of me and the next thought that came rushing through was 'What the hell did I just put you through.'"""""|12782
Oh for fucks sake I did not chamber a round, eh fuck it, stick around and piss people off some more.|12782
"'I guess that was not enough morphine.'"""""|12782
"I do not remember clearly, but I saw my mother, sister and stepfather next to me and I thought 'the heck is going on?'"""|12782
I do not remember the attempt, and hardly what happened after.|12782
But when I regained consciousness, I regretted not succeed.|12782
After that (it is been 4 or 5 years), I started planning another attempt, but then I got a boyfriend as the last chance to life.|12782
He was the only reason to keep alive for the 4 and half years we stayed together, not even my family was reason enough.|12782
Now the only reason I do not kill myself is that it would give too much trouble for the people that would find me.|12782
While I do not craft some crazy machine that would evaporate my body painlessly, I am treating with meds and cbt.|12782
I am trying, but the thought of keep living is exhausting.|12782
I do not watch news anymore, the only news source I use is the onion, I am trying to do lists to follow weekly, eating health, exercising, etc etc.|12782
But still, I resent the ex-bf.|12782
If I did not date him, I would kill myself while I still did not care about the others.|12782
I hope someday I will thank him for it.|12782
"But for now, I cannot stop thinking that being dead would be better """|12782
I have tried commuting suicide several times.|12782
Once after I was molested when I was a kid; I drank some bleach and my father found me on the floor and took me to the hospital.|12782
I thought I did not drink enough so try something else.|12782
Second time was via me taking a bunch of pills.|12782
I passed out and woke up with my gut feeling horrific.|12782
Third time was after I moved back home for a little bit.|12782
I had a gun and decided that would be the most effective way to do it, so loaded it and pulled the trigger.|12782
Gun had jammed.|12782
My sister came home and I did not want to do it with her there so I put it away.|12782
Eventually got rid of it.|12782
It's seven years later and I still think about suicide frequently.|12782
Its not all the time any more, though.|12782
Each time I have just hated myself more for failing to do even that.|12782
Anyways, I have a kid now and cannot worry about that.|12782
There's always tomorrow, right?|12782
"'I cannot believe that just happened'"" '""That was so easy'"" '""I need to tell my mom'""[BK][BK]I was 18 and in a very bad place."|12782
I used a belt and hung it on a plant holder hook in the ceiling if the living room.|12782
I stood on the edge of the couch and there was a short time of deciding, but it was very short.|12782
I let go.|12782
It was uncomfortable, but it didnt really hurt.|12782
I passed out.|12782
I woke up on the floor because the plant holder hook had broken out of the ceiling.|12782
[BK][BK]I thought I was dead because I actually felt good and it was hard to move or open my eyes.|12782
When I did, my dog was laying next to me.|12782
I could not believe that I just did it.|12782
I could not believe that I wanted to leave my dog and my family.|12782
I cannot believe that I almost succeeded.|12782
[BK][BK]The next thought was a bit grotesque.|12782
That was so easy.|12782
So practically painless.|12782
If I decide to do this again, this is definitely the way I will choose to do it.|12782
[BK][BK]The final thought was that I needed to tell my mom.|12782
"I needed help. """|12782
'I tried to kill myself and failed at that, too.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I do not have those suicidal thoughts now."|12782
Well, maybe a few times a year.|12782
But not nearly as often as I did back then.|12782
Most days I still wish I would have succeeded, however.|12782
I am not really in a much better place mentally but I have mostly gotten my life on track enough to be a normal member of the rat race.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not see much good in the world and that makes it really difficult to change my mindset.|12782
My girlfriend is positive Patricia about life and it is very very hard for me most of the time to accept that.|12782
My cat is my best friend and the thing I look forward to the most everyday.|12782
[BK][BK]I would like to think that most people are able to turn their lives around and work towards finding happiness.|12782
Gf and I have argued many times over this topic.|12782
"She thinks suicide is selfish, but it is far more selfish (imo) to want somebody you care about to be alive and live miserably everyday just because you do not want to deal with them being gone. """|12782
"The first one for me was sort of a 'well, oh well, I guess I should start getting ready for work.'"""""|12782
'Goddammit I am not dead.|12782
"And I am all out of dope.'"""""|12782
"In High school I tried cutting m wrists, got the point of the knife in m wrist, realized that it hurt (somehow I didnt realize that) and the pain made me realize what I was doing, I had an 'oh shit'"" moment, and spent the entire night staring at the ceiling."|12782
[BK][BK][BK]A few weeks ago, I took a razor from work home with me, had an entire plan, but accepted a coworkers offer to go smoke with him after work.|12782
I love weed but at that state I almost decline just so I could go home and put my plan into action.|12782
Instead, I went to my coworkers, we blazed, he helped to try to find me an apartment (I was just kicked out of where I was living at the time, on top of a host of other things ogoin on in my life and how I was looking at myself) and we had some laughs and it helped me re-focus.|12782
I went into my car and threw the razor out.|12782
[BK][BK]That, and making sure to finally see a therapist, literally saved my life.|12782
When you have a plan and are letting that side of you win the battle, go see help immediately.|12782
"It is not worth it, and no person that asks for help is '""weak'"" or '""wrong."|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Super cheesy, but you owe it to all of us to stay here."|12782
"And without the sour we could never appreciate the sweet."""|12782
I tried twice.|12782
I have a nerve disease.|12782
It's also called the suicide disease because, well, it sucks.|12782
Cancer would be better because at least I would have a chance to have a cure, remission, or die and be done.|12782
The first time I took a whole bottle of my sleeping pills.|12782
I woke up the next day, albeit really late in the day.|12782
I thought, I guess I am not supposed to die yet and thanked God I was alive and did my best for the next few years.|12782
Several years down the road I went to a park/forest during the day, I knew hardly anyone would be around, in left two forms of I.D.|12782
in my car and one in my pocket and sat down in seclusion with my 9mm in my mouth, against my temple etc.|12782
I just did not or could not pull the trigger.|12782
A decade later and I am married and have a daughter.|12782
So I would never do it now, but there are days I am glad I keep my guns at my uncle's.|12782
I am religious, so my first conscious thoughts were that God was not ready for me on the other side yet.|12782
I still had chances of happiness on this earth .|12782
Which has been true.|12782
It was not a specific suicide attempt, but I had hurt myself really badly.|12782
I cut myself and when I saw the skin separate like cutting into raw chicken or something, I panicked.|12782
It was about midnight, only my mom was awake.|12782
Immediately my first thought was I need to tell my mom, I need my mom, she can fix it.|12782
I started crying and went downstairs holding my arm, and she right away stood up out of her chair, brought me into the kitchen and helped me clean it out.|12782
I was so afraid she was going to be angry, I would been cutting myself for years, and there was definite sign of that around the wound.|12782
"[BK][BK]Eventually we went to walgreens and gave it a DIY 'stitching'"" with a couple kinds of band-aids because I begged her to not take me to the hospital to get real stitches,  my dad would find out that way."|12782
She promised that this time she would not but if it ever happened again, we had do it the right way, and he would find out.|12782
"[BK][BK]I just remember when I asked if she was mad at me she said, '""No, of course not."|12782
"I am worried for you and I am afraid, but we are going to take you to Dr. FamilyDoctor and she is going to help you get better.'"""|12782
I still cry when I think about that.|12782
I am still very depressed, but I could never imagine killing myself with a mother who loves me like that.|12782
"[BK][BK]I now have a scar on my arm about an inch long and maybe 4mm wide, the size has definitely reduced over time, but I still get really embarrassed by it and want to cover it with a tattoo or something."""|12782
'Let''s hear what she has to say on Wednesday.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Backstory: It was my first year pursuing a diploma in school after, like, 11 years of verbal abuse by my dad at home, 5 of which I have had zero friends in school."|12782
Gaming was an escape for me (which my parents are against all the time), but I became severely depressed, and would always think of suicide as an escape.|12782
[BK][BK]To be frank, it was not a deliberate suicide attempt, but when I was in the middle of a deep pool and I started panicking, half my brain wanted me to accept it, while the other half wanted me to wait for Wednesday to hear about a girl talk about Christ.|12782
Long story short, she shared about Christ, and my life is now much, much better.|12782
[BK][BK]It''s not like the depression is completely gone or anything; I still struggle to do anything on bad days, but remembering what God has given me and done for me gives me hope and strength to go on and keep doing stuff for Him.|12782
"It''s worth the pain."""|12782
I was confused as fuck.|12782
I had more than half a bottle of vodka left in my stash.|12782
(750ml) I wanted to know if I could finish it.|12782
But I wanted to die.|12782
14 shots (Between 1 and 1.5oz) of vodka in about 3-4 hours I dont quite remember.|12782
But i do remember passing out.|12782
I woke up an hour later and vomitted.|12782
After looking at different calculators i mightve been .3-.4 I shouldve died.|12782
But i didnt.|12782
To this day i dont know how i didnt die.|12782
Maybe I was pouring a little less than the shot glass?|12782
Who knows.|12782
[BK][BK]Im 20yo male.|12782
120lbs.|12782
wasnt drinking any water.|12782
I was numb, but grateful for it.|12782
Grateful to be awake from self imposed oblivion.|12782
I was still intoxicated when I woke up in the ER, I wanted to leave and go outside but they would not let me.|12782
I was drunk and bleeding heavily.|12782
The police came to settle things, drew their guns on me and ordered me around.|12782
A nurse came to me and touched me, asked me what was wrong and I just broke down.|12782
Her warm and caring physical contact felt amazing after waking up to that calamity.|12782
I was cuffed and 51/50'd.|12782
Woke up 3 days later and took the bus 30 miles home.|12782
Went to work the next day to beg for my job back.|12782
I have anxiety, depression, and very bad bipolar disorder and it is very hard to deal with, even with therapy, a loving family and friend group, and multiple medications.|12782
I have attempted suicide a few times (I am 17) but they were kind of half assed because I was scared.. For a good reason.|12782
The most recent time I decided I needed to go.|12782
I thought I was a hindrance to everyone I knew and it was better if I died.|12782
I swallowed my newly refilled bottle of venlafaxine pills and lied down.|12782
I fell asleep instantly.|12782
I woke up about 4 hours later and I could barely move.|12782
I heard my favorite pet, my gecko I have had for four years, jump on the glass and look at me.|12782
I realized how loved I was then.|12782
My twin brother was asleep in the room down the hall..|12782
I thought about what I would feel if he did this to himself.|12782
I half limped half crawled into my parents room and woke them up to tell them what happened.|12782
I have never seen my father cry.|12782
My brother held me in the back seat of the car on the way to the hospital.|12782
I was able to leave after three days.|12782
The doctors said they were surprised I did not go into a coma or worse.|12782
Ever since then, I have never attempted.|12782
I am proud to say that I am happy to be alive.|12782
Guys, it is never worth it.|12782
You are loved.|12782
There is ALWAYS a way to get through something.|12782
[BK]|12782
For a moment I felt oh shit this is serious.|12782
But eventually my memory of the feeling went away, like all feelings.|12782
Dissociation is hell, u can barley feel but when u feel , u forgot how it feels in some seconds.|12782
Its like sensory Alzheimers.|12782
No offense [BK][BK]I suffered from chronic  depersonalization and chronic HPPD.|12782
And I have a really bad form of hppd as well.|12782
So I was always thinking about commiting suicide.|12782
But despite this all I cannot resist my curious feeling of the future .|12782
but I am the type of suicider that put we in a situation where it can happen, and if it happens , too bad.|12782
[BK][BK]Last thing I remember was that I took 4mg xanax, 9 h later I wake up in my mind because of a call, it was the police.|12782
Someone had called because I was cutting my arms, and drinking alcohol after eating the whole 30mg bag of xanax.|12782
[BK][BK]The sad thing is that is likely I will not get older than 30 because of my destructive behavior.|12782
And no one will ever understand the situation I am in, and it feela so lonley.|12782
Every one dies eventually with there memories so it really does not matter when someone chooses to go|12782
Obviously a throwaway..[BK]Ok, long story.|12782
I know this'll be buried and no-one will read, but here we go.|12782
I am in my early thirties Now, this episode happened 2011.|12782
I am a finn, had a terrible childhood with being bullied extremely heavily each and every day for 12 years at school.|12782
However  went to study for masters in economics later on.|12782
[BK]I really had everything just about right in my life, I had already lived abroad, worked abroad, become fluent on german etc.|12782
Studies were great.|12782
I went to Munich (where I also have lived before) with a bunch of friends and just out of nowhere, I tried to jump in front of a subway train at Marienplatz subway station.|12782
My friends literally saved my life by wrestling me down.|12782
I was very very drunk, the hangover lasted all the way back home on a car (1500 miles, 48 hours) [BK]Til this day I do not know what happened.|12782
I just got very drunk and tried to kill my self by getting absolutely maimed by a fucking train.|12782
I do tend to get depressed, I still think that i should never been born.|12782
But I really would never dare to kill my self.|12782
And I never to this day admit to my friends that I remember what happened, was a complete shock to wake up next day and to hear them talk about this and the mood was..|12782
I would say half of them completely disappeared from my life and half stay in touch after graduation, needless to say I am really ashamed of how our trip to Oktoberfest and to my Ex hometown ended..[BK][BK]Actually quite frankly I just want to start over and forget about the past, been a lifelong alcoholic and used drugs and tranquilizers heavily as a teen, to escape the reality.|12782
And never since tried again, never going to and really made progress by not drinking, not using anything and really working hard to start all over (applying all the time for jobs in Germany as the Job market back home really suck at the moment (unemployment being ~18% measured by the governmental employment ministry)[BK][BK]Also was the happiest time in my life when I lived in Germany.|12782
Will go back ASAP..[BK][BK]Sorry for a long rant, obviously dont wanna use more permanent nick for this, but really helps to vent|12782
Hmm, if I remember right it was: '...I am thinking.|12782
That means I am alive.|12782
Goddammit, my stepmom''s yelling at me to get ready for school.|12782
I will have to try again later.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I somehow managed to stagger into the shower and get dressed."|12782
Couldn''t speak, and had a hell of a time getting down the stairs.|12782
I had previously ended up in the hospital after taking 16 Coricidin HBP cold and cough pills.|12782
(Wasn''t trying to kill myself at the time, it was recreational.)|12782
Since that had *almost* killed me before, I figured that 32 of those and and 72 Tylenol would do the trick.|12782
I cannot describe just how beaten I felt at that moment.|12782
I mean fuck, I could not even *die* right.|12782
[BK][BK]I will not get into the explicit details, but after getting out of the hospital I spent the better part of 1 1/2 years in residential psych care.|12782
Apparently they did not really know what to do with someone who broke down their reasoning for suicide the way I did.|12782
[BK][BK]It''s always been a pretty simple equation in my mind.|12782
If the sum of my negative and neutral experiences has greater weight than the value of my positive experiences, it was my preference to not exist, rather than to exist.|12782
There is no meaning or purpose to life beyond that which the person experiencing it assigns to it.|12782
If the person experiencing life feels there is no value in it, then there is no reason to continue experiencing it.|12782
[BK][BK]It''s been 15 years since then, and I still hold that opinion.|12782
My experience with life has been amusing at best, and pretty horrible at worst.|12782
I have obligations to meet and promises to keep though, so I continue to wake up in the morning.|12782
Do I have depression?|12782
Certainly.|12782
But I have been dealing with that for twenty years or so, I can deal with it a few more.|12782
Who knows, maybe I will find something worth living for.|12782
[BK][BK]Finally, if *you* are feeling depressed or suicidal, talk to someone.|12782
It may just help.|12782
My understanding is that for many people medication, therapy or trusted friends can help.|12782
You owe it to yourself to give it a shot.|12782
If it is an event or series of events that has made you consider ending things, try giving it some time.|12782
Cliché as it sounds, time does make the pain fade.|12782
It sucks.|12782
I know, I have spent a long time there.|12782
I have also had friends that have been there and now seem truly happy.|12782
It''s possibly the most important decision you can possibly make, so at least take the time to consider it properly.|12782
"[BK][BK]Since this post has gone on for longer than I planned, thanks to those of you that read it and I hope it provided some form of insight. """|12782
I have planned different things before.|12782
Did research on doing the exit bag method.|12782
But lately it has been a challenge to not just go for it and take my entire bottle of Xerelto (blood thinner).|12782
I also thought about jumping out in front of a car or cutting myself because I know my blood is so thin I would easily bleed out.|12782
Or if I wanted to make it look natural I could just start throwing out my daily blood thinner suddenly and let a blood clot do it.|12782
I got a DVT in my right calf about a year ago and it broke loose and lodged in my lungs.|12782
"The doctor in the ICU told me 'the only time we see pulmonary embolism this bad is in an autopsy.'"""|12782
"I remember being like...fuck, it should have taken me."""|12782
Mostly i was confused as to why everything hurt so much, especially my face.|12782
[BK][BK]Turns out a few nurses thought i was 'faking' unconsciousness because of my mental health issues and had repeatedly pressed as hard as they could on my brow bones in order to 'snap me out of it'.|12782
Then someone finally noticed that my lips were blue and i was rushed off to resus.|12782
Thank you for the two black eyes, nurses.|12782
[BK][BK]Mostly i was embarrassed though.|12782
My last suicide attempt was a good few years ago now, I am in therapy/recovery and doing well.|12782
I never want to go there again.|12782
"'Yep, I must be dead, because I am still in hell.'"""""|12782
Never shared the full story with anyone, but here goes:[BK][BK]In 2012 I was diagnosed with a neuro-degenerative illness and was told there are only a few dozen active recorded cases, and in past cases some patients have gotten something called [Morvan's Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morvan%27s_syndrome) which leads to fatal insomnia.|12782
[BK][BK]I was hospitalized for a month because my lung function was severely affected by the illness for a short time and I developed dementia and what appeared to be hallucinations (I do not remember most of my time at the hospital).|12782
Even then I was getting pretty decent sleep, so Morvan's syndrome was not on my radar until doctors told me it could become a real possibility (the EEG's showed I was getting very little REM sleep).|12782
Thankfully my lung function started to improve and I was released from the hospital, and went back to work.|12782
I was also given a drug called oxcarbazapine to help with the muscle issues.|12782
[BK][BK]About 2 months after getting released from the hospital I started sleep walking.|12782
And really really walking.|12782
I lived alone and would open the door in my sleep, and walk off into the city.|12782
I would usually find myself somewhere a mile or two away, and my legs would be in extreme pain, like I had been running.|12782
Needless to say it was pretty terrifying and I was basically getting no sleep.|12782
[BK][BK]This had been going on for a couple of weeks, and I was still going to work, and one Friday a work friend I had known for years asked me if I wanted to play games with a group of friends that night, and I said yes.|12782
When I got there I met my friend at the door and then slowly began talking to other people as they talked to me, and then I introduced myself by name to one guy and he laughed and said he knew who I was, and that we had all hung out together the weekend before...|12782
I had absolutely no memory of this, and I started to feel really fucking confused and nauseous and drove home.|12782
Later that night I woke up in a lawn with the sprinklers going...|12782
I was about a mile from my house.|12782
Sleep deprived, confused, and angry I walked back to my house and downed ALL of my pills.|12782
[BK][BK]Less than 20 minutes later I was hurling... and because my muscles are fucked up, some of it started aspirating into my lungs...|12782
I fucking panicked and called 911.|12782
The fire station was about 2 blocks from my house, and it felt like they were there in seconds, I did not even have to open the door...|12782
I just looked up and there were people in my house and I could see red lights flashing through the window.|12782
[BK][BK]They took me to the hospital, and started to give me some sludge stuff to drink that was supposed to keep me from absorbing much more... it was awful, and I was vomiting and aspirating a bit more, and I told them to stop.|12782
And the nurses kept doing it, but a doctor came in and told them to stop because the drug I had taken was not very potent in overdoses and because he did not think pumping my stomach would help because I would be okay.|12782
[BK][BK]The first thought was not thankfulness or hope, or anything like that...|12782
Instead I can only describe it as being entirely in the moment.|12782
Like nothing else mattered outside of the now, there was no work, no relationships, no responsibilities.|12782
I just felt very alive and conscious of everything that was going on.|12782
[BK][BK]I stayed there overnight and half of the next day before getting released.|12782
Initially they said I would be there at least three days, but the afternoon after the night I was admitted a doctor came in smiling and said he had good news.|12782
He said he had spoken to someone about the oxcarbazapine drug I was taking, and that person told him that a very very small percentage of people taking it start sleepwalking.|12782
He told me to stop taking it, and said the nurses would bring me paperwork to discharge me and give me numbers to call if I again felt the way I had when I had been admitted.|12782
[BK][BK]It's been 4 years now, and while I still have major issues with the neurodegenerative illness, I have never had sleepwalking problems again since stopping my prescription for the drug.|12782
[BK][BK]**TL;DR:** My initial thoughts before knowing I would be okay were a feeling of being in a totally surreal place and disconnected from life... and then that transitioned into very 'in the moment' thoughts and feelings when I learned I was not successful.|12782
Everything felt very... real.|12782
I took sixteen pills of 50 mg Sertraline, four pills of 0.5 mg Lorazepam (Ativan), a can of redbull, a bottle of prescription cough medicine (Codeine), and alcohol.|12782
At that point, my anxiety kept me from sleeping and eating.|12782
I was a 21 year-old Asian girl and just weighed a little over 100 lbs.|12782
I was up and about walking around in public until I started throwing up and I was sent to the hospital.|12782
"When I came to, the first thought that came to mind was 'I failed...again.'"""|12782
There were just these endless tears that would roll down my cheeks.|12782
Even then I felt like an empty vessel.|12782
I still did not feel very much alive at all and mostly just detached from everyone and everything.|12782
I was watching the world in third person through a gray filter.|12782
I wanted to leave the hospital and rip out the IV in my arm, but I was honestly also too exhausted to fight anyone.|12782
There was always someone watching me from outside the room in the hospital.|12782
They would come in to check on me from time to time.|12782
"At one point she asked me why I was crying and all I could respond was '""I do not know.'"""|12782
Since I live out of state for college, my parents could not come to the hospital in person, but it broke my heart to hear how much I hurt them when I spoke to them on the phone.|12782
It broke my heart to see how much I hurt my closest friends.|12782
It changed the reality of what I had originally thought to be the truth but it was really just a delusion that my depression wanted me to believe in.|12782
My three days spent at the hospital were full of lies straight through my teeth and I somehow managed to convince the stream of staff members that I do not need any more medication and counseling that I never went but cancelled.|12782
[BK][BK]Now a days, there is still a nagging thought in my head that maybe I would be better off dead.|12782
I try to keep it at bay with days/nights that are so lit that I am grateful to be surrounded by good vibes and good people.|12782
I am thankful for the support from my family and friends and I find it very difficult to understand why I still feel the way I do.|12782
Because existing does not feel like it is enough for me.|12782
"[BK][BK]"""|12782
"I will never forget the moment, after the call to come to the hospital, after following the ambulance to a distant town because lifeflight was grounded due to snow, after over 12 hours of holding his body, holding his head, as he slowly regained consciousness but was still not within his head due to the toxicity of all that he swallowed, through the hallucinations when he was conscious that we tried to have him breathe through, I just remember that moment, when his eyes cleared and I saw HIM in those eyes for just a short moment - his first words were 'I am still here'"" - and the intense sadness, the despair was in the color of his eyes."|12782
It''s probably one of the most heart wrenching experiences of my life and stays with me still.|12782
It''s been 18 months, and he is alive, working part-time as he still recovers from the after effects.|12782
There are certain visceral moments as a parent - that is one of my top ones.|12782
"And I worry, still, because he does not talk about it anymore - will he be ok?"""|12782
"when things got really bad, I decided to do *it* by drinking lots of bug spray (stupid, i know but tbf I was really young then), after i took it, i did not get unconscious as expected, at first it felt nothing except an unusual taste in my mouth, but after a while, i got this strange feeling and I started vomiting n vomiting, just continuously.. after 2-3 hours when it finally stopped, my first thought was 'well that was a huge mistake'"" not because suddenly I wanted to live again, but because i failed.."|12782
It pained for, what it seems like, days now.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]That incident was really bad for me because every time i thought about killing myself, or even started to actually do it, i would get scared of failing again.|12782
i decided that I would not do it until I found a quick and painless way.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]after that, whenever I read, heard or came to know that someone had committed suicide, I was more curious about ''how'' rather than ''why'', but still years went by and no luck.|12782
That was until I saw the imitation game a few days back, searched online how he did it, and it said he used apple seeds.|12782
All these years I had this excuse of not having the means to do it and now that I have..|12782
I do not know..|12782
I mean things still have not gotten better, I still have no friends, no family, still in pain all the time, still a handicap.. still all alone.. and I do not want to be alone, not anymore.|12782
"I do not know if I can do this all alone..  im sorry I know this was not part of the question asked, but I just.. had to get it out. """|12782
I was depressed for as long as I can remember.|12782
I was bullied by everyone around me and my parents were even worse.|12782
By the time I was 10 I had had enough.|12782
But I did not actually know how to go about it.|12782
[BK][BK]I remembered hearing about someone killing themselves by taking pills.|12782
I did not know what kind of pills would work.|12782
I assumed any pills.|12782
[BK]So while I was in the kitchen doing dishes one night I waited until both of my parents left the room and I quickly grabbed a bottle of something and shoved it in my pocket without looking.|12782
[BK][BK]I had to wait until everyone went to sleep.|12782
So I waited for hours until I was certain everyone was asleep and I crept into the bathroom.|12782
We had those paper Dixie cups for rinsing your mouth out while you were brushing your teeth and I filled one up with water and opened the bottle and just started swallowing pills.|12782
[BK][BK]Eventually my mom I guess heard something and started banging on the door and yelling at me to go to bed.|12782
She was always trying to get me to practice putting on makeup even though I hated it.|12782
So I started messing around with the makeup bag on the counter so she would not be able to hear me putting the remaining pills back in the bottle.|12782
I opened the door and apologized and told her I was just trying on makeup like she wanted and she angrily told me to get into bed.|12782
I layed down thinking I would finally be done with all of this by tomorrow.|12782
[BK][BK]The next day I woke up.|12782
"I immediately thought [BK]'I am not supposed to be here.'"""|12782
And was filled with mostly dread, but also the tiniest bit of relief.|12782
[BK][BK]Turns out the bottle I grabbed the night before was Midol.|12782
I have no idea honestly to this day if that would have killed me or not had I finished the bottle.|12782
My stomach hurt all day the next day and I thought that maybe because I did not take enough it was just a slow and drawn out death and I took some comfort in that.|12782
"[BK]I am glad it did not now, even though I am still struggling with depression ten years later I am not suicidal anymore. """|12782
Honestly I did not feel much of anything at all while vomiting for a good 6 hours.|12782
After it was all done I had convinced myself that I was just trying to get high.|12782
[BK][BK]It was a Fentanyl overdose.|12782
I had laboured breathing as I was slowly drifting away.|12782
I would smoke Fentanyl gel from a piece of foil, more and more as I drifted out.|12782
I noticed my breathing and the fact that after enough of an opiate, to overdose, you do not  feel much of anything at all.|12782
Not even euphoria.|12782
[BK][BK]Right now I am realizing that I had attempted suicide that day.|12782
I do not know how to feel about that...|12782
I went through a lot of emotions that night.|12782
To be honest I am not sure quite how serious i was, or how much i was just looking for attention, but i took a good 2000mg of ibuprofen after drinking a good amount.|12782
The utter emptiness, followed by the moment of regret and grief when it really settled in what i did, followed by a lot of inner strength emerging, and a hell of a lot of crying...[BK][BK]Well, i wish i could say i really did start getting better after that night but i dropped out after a break down a month and a half later.|12782
I am so much better now|12782
I am not quite sure.|12782
Mostly I had to make up a story to explain what happened to the fire fighters, police and emts.|12782
After that I was in  shock for a while and I guess my first aware thought about everything was how bad I screwed myself by failing and how badly I wished I had not.|12782
[BK][BK]Going through that has left me with permanent pain which I almost killed myself with alcohol because of.|12782
[BK][BK]But going through such a rough time, being rescued by complete strangers and friends alike has made me so appreciative and understanding of myself.|12782
I hate that I went through it, I hate that I still slip and struggle, but I am who I am today because of the shit I went through and I truely like who I am today.|12782
[BK][BK]If you feel down, depressed or just sad please talk to someone, anyone, I am here you can talk to me, there is the crisis help text line and so many resources.|12782

Can't sleep, so I might as well contribute.|12782
Although I was not able to ACTUALLY go through with it, I attempted suicide twice in middle school.|12782
I was generally hated, and suffered from extreme OCD, and had not had my meds fully worked out.|12782
The constant bullying, anger, and hurt never helps.|12782
Even today, I still suffer from OCD and depression, which amplify each other.|12782
Since middle school, I have forgotten much of what happened, and even I have even forgotten most of the details of my two attempts.|12782
I did learn that even if I did it, it would be a million times worse for those who cared about me.|12782
Even as depressed as I get today (which does not help after major spine surgery), I do not consider suicide an option.|12782
I could not hurt my family and friends like that.|12782
For those of you who are thinking about it, do not.|12782
It can get better.|12782
Although I am still not exactly fantastic, I can get through the pain.|12782
You can too.|12782
Fuck, I was like ten or eleven when I got through most of it.|12782
If a middle schooler who cannot grasp the concept of how others care about them made it, you can too.|12782
Stay strong.|12782
'Fuck.|12782
At least I made the noose properly.|12782
"Might as well call someone who can help.'"""|12782
I tried to hang myself, but the sturdiest thing I could find was not very sturdy, and so I found myself with glass and metal in my face and around my body when I woke up.|12782
I then got forced into a mental ward and kicked out of school.|12782
"They did not want a third suicide in a year at the university."""|12782
Posting this in the hopes that someone reads this and finds the strength they need.|12782
[BK][BK]I was clinically depressed in high school because of a multitude of things but my parents never sought treatment for it because they thought that all I had to do was be happy and it would fix itself.|12782
I had suicidal thoughts every single day and I would save the little packets from medicine bottles, food, etc.|12782
that are supposed to keep the moisture out (silica gel) and put them in my drawer.|12782
One day, after a terrible day at school, I came home and just....could not deal with it anymore.|12782
I took out the 25 packets I had saved up over a few months, tore them open and swallowed them all.|12782
"I mean, it said 'Do Not Eat'"" on them so I figured they would be poisonous."|12782
When I finished swallowing them, I decided to go on MSN messenger and send my goodbyes to my friends.|12782
I end up talking to one of my friends about the shit day he is having and that he is worried about his mom because she had to go to the hospital for surgery.|12782
"I calm him down and he says the sentence that I will never forget, *'""Thanks for talking to me, I do not know what I would have done without you."|12782
"'""*[BK]Without even typing a reply, I run straight to the bathroom and make myself throw up everything."|12782
Now he is my best friend, going 7 years strong!|12782
"[BK]I found out months later that silica gel would not really have harmed me and now I am always randomly letting my friends know how much I appreciate them in case they are going through a difficult time :)"""|12782
Oh Fuck!|12782
[BK]I have to clean this mess of blood so nobody will notice I have tried and not even succeeded.|12782
[BK]Its kinda sad that nobody even noticed it because I was so good at hiding.|12782
[BK][BK]I made it through these dark times now, but I wish I would have talked to somebody a lot earlier!|12782
[BK]Depression is a serious illness and you deserve this help, even if you do not feel you are worth it.|12782
You definitely are!|12782
[BK]Please do not hide your feelings and talk to somebody!|12782
[BK]Have a good day :)|12782
I never got to attempt it, but I was days away from potentially trying.|12782
Counselors found out through a friend of mine that I was potentially planning to do it-- but even to this day I do not know what I would have done had the day came.|12782
I had planned to OD in the woods on OTC meds.|12782
[BK][BK]My first thought when they brought me in was that I knew I could not do it now no matter how I felt and that I just wanted to go back to class and forget that I had ever even thought about it.|12782
It also basically solidified me internalizing a lot of stuff that I still do to this day, because my friends still worry about me hurting myself more than 10 years later.|12782
Probably not the usual instant regret story.|12782
After taking a bottle of anti-anxiety meds and washing them down with a bottle of vodka, my husband (boyfriend at the time) called an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital.|12782
My best friend was by my side, and although I cannot remember anything she told me I kept crying and saying I wish I had died.|12782
[BK][BK]The rest is also sort of blurry.|12782
I remember having to call my parents and tell them what had happened.|12782
At the time I was ashamed and could not get the words out when my mom picked up.|12782
I asked for my twin sister, who then relayed the message to my parents.|12782
She told me after I sounded like a stranger, I was talking at half the normal speed and was slurring so much I was near unintelligible.|12782
[BK][BK]After convincing my family not to drive five hours to see me, I guess I passed out for a few more hours.|12782
I was in and out of consciousness while they flushed my system.|12782
[BK][BK]When I was disharged from the hospital, I was taken to the Waterford (mental hospital) where I waited for what seemed like forever (this is the same day, late at night now).|12782
After talking to a psychologist for a couple of hours I was deemed stable enough to go home for some reason.|12782
(he told me I was depressed, duh, with borderline tendencies) I think at this point my speech was still slurred, I definitely was not in my right mind.|12782
But for some reason I was not kept overnight.|12782
[BK][BK]So after about 16 hours I crawled back into my bed, same bedroom where I had decided to end my life.|12782
I felt exhausted, ashamed, guilty, and scared.|12782
I felt this way for days afterwards, but only relieved I was unsuccessful for the sake of my loved ones.|12782
That feeling was mixed with guilt.|12782
[BK][BK]Two years of recovery later and I still have recurring nightmares.|12782
Not an experience I am willing to repeat.|12782
But if I am being completely honest with myself, what I went through only made me determined not to fuck up if I tried again.|12782
Luckily, I have no desire to do so in the immediate future, as I am in a good place right now mentally.|12782
'Aaaagh....|12782
"If I knew they would stick me full of needles in the hospital, I never would have done it!'"""|12782
[BK][BK]I have always been horrendously terrified of needles.|12782
I would ripped the IV off multiple times so they had to keep replacing it in different spots.|12782
[BK]I am cringing at the memory.|12782
[BK][BK]But I remember finding it funny.|12782
Funny how I had just tried to kill myself but I woke up wishing I had not because... needles.|12782
It made me realize that I did not actually want to die, but my brain and my illness led me to do so.|12782
[BK][BK]Mental illness is something I wish more people would understand.|12782
We want to die because some of our minds are too loud and we want peace and quiet just once.|12782
Or forever.|12782
What our brain makes us believe is that we are trapped and that we will never escape this ''noise''.|12782
But things eventually do quiet down, it just requires patience, time, and ultimately, willpower.|12782
[BK][BK]I just want to say that I am proud of myself for surviving and sticking it out.|12782
I am also proud of all the survivors on this post.|12782
Everywhere, even.|12782

I stood on the roof of my house, finished writing my note and left it there.|12782
I just stood on the edge, closed my eyes, and felt the breeze.|12782
Just about to step off and my brother scoops me backwards, sobbing.|12782
"[BK][BK]First thing I felt was, 'aw shit, made my baby brother cry.'"""|12782
Then, my parents came sprinting upstairs and my dad told me to go pack a bag, so we could go to the hospital.|12782
When I came down, he was sobbing - the last time I would seen him cry was at his own dad''s funeral.|12782
He kept asking me why, and I just kept saying I did not care anymore.|12782
[BK][BK]Two weeks later, I still have my moments but I realize how much I would miss my dad.|12782
Sometimes I feel guilty for knowing that I would miss him more than the rest of my family, but he is my best friend.|12782
He told me if I had died he would be right behind me, and then I felt bad that he has to wake up and worry about me every day.|12782
[BK][BK]My mental illnesses got in the way of my relationship with a guy I am sure is the love of my life.|12782
I hated kids and weddings and love until I met him, and I let my insecurities get in the way and we had to break up.|12782
He will not even speak to me anymore, but my friends have all told me he is worried sick, and I know he loves me a ton.|12782
I am sure my parents told him to give me space why I get healthy, and I wish he was here every second.|12782
With a clearer head (and a severe depression and anxiety diagnosis, along with medication) I realize that the pain would leave me and just manifest in those I love.|12782
I got a puppy and she helps on those bad days, but I miss my ex so much every second.|12782
It gets hard to breathe sometimes.|12782

I planned it well through.|12782
I was at the lowest in my life.|12782
"Being only 17 years old I was feeling kind of '""dramatical'"" but I did not care."|12782
[BK][BK][BK]But when I actually did it, I did not feel anything, I was taking the pills in doses and I was not looking back or feel bad.|12782
I did not feel bad about leaving my twin sister or leaving my parents.|12782
[BK]After about 3 hours my parents came home and unusually entered my room to me looking weird and not responding.|12782
I was not unconsious but just did not know what to say.|12782
[BK]After I told them they took me to the hospital right away.|12782
But the process and the behavior of some doctor resulted in making it another 3 hours before I had my stomach pumped out.|12782
[BK]Meanwhile my parents being told that the pumping will not save me and that they cannot tell If I will be alive in the morning or not.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]I spent the whole night throwing up black water and did not sleep at all.|12782
I was in the intense care unit and I hated the thought that I was still alive.|12782
And I hated that thought week later when I was finally leaving the ICU and moving to the children unit.|12782
And week later I still hated that thought when they moved into the psychiatric institution where I saw crazy girl banging her head and loudly yelling over and over that she want to go home(19y.o?)|12782
where I spent one week before I was moved to the children unit once again since there was no space.|12782
But to my suprise to this day, I did not proceed to do anything else..|12782
"I guess the one try '""weared'"" me out and I did not want to do in it a public place."|12782
[BK][BK][BK]But today, I can say, that the experience had changed my alot.|12782
Sometimes I think I am completely different and feel different.|12782
I am more confident, outgoing and do not feel ashamed of me as I did.|12782
Of course it was not over night, it took a year to feel better and till this day I suffer depression stages and asocial feelings and ashamed of myself.|12782
But I am really happy I am here and if anybody want to speak, I am always here and I do not intend to leave.|12782

"'What the FUCK do I do now'"" """|12782
Like all of you, this thread is worth saving.|12782
Be well, Redditors :-)|12782
When I was 17, I had already attempted suicide twice.|12782
The final try ended up with me trying to drink myself to death.|12782
I had so much alcohol in my system that I apparently vomited uncontrollably everywhere for several hours, cried non-stop and tried walking into traffic.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not remember any of that - instead, my first memory was waking up in a hospital bed with several monitoring cables attached to my bare chest, trousers covered in puke and urine, and some kind of IV gadget in an arm.|12782
My immediate reaction was to cry.|12782
I knew I had missed the opportunity, I knew that I had failed even to take my own life, purely because I was (and remain) too scared to take a gun to my head or jump off a large height.|12782
I cried my eyes out with what little energy I had left, frustrated and powerless, profoundly and irredeemably broken by the realisation that I have to continue living a life with severe depression and a post traumatic stress disorder that have crippled me.|12782
[BK][BK]Things have not gotten better since then, but they have gotten easier.|12782
Unfortunately there is no real way to solve these issues.|12782
It's a shame we invest more money into warfare and conflict than health, and science as a whole.|12782

Commenting on this late so my reply will most likely get buried.|12782
Happens to also be my first comment.|12782
Anyway, I am not a survivor of suicide but I am a first hand account of a survivor of suicide from the beginning.|12782
[BK]I woke up on the morning of June 1st, 2014.|12782
It was a Sunday and I had work so I would have usually just gone straight into the bathroom but this day, this day was different.|12782
I could have never known on this day my life would be changed forever.|12782
when I woke up I had an overwhelming urge to check on my older brother(D) .|12782
House was too empty, both of my parents gone.|12782
It was not a panic sort of feeling but more of intuition that guided me through my house and straight downstairs.|12782
Now if you knew me you had know I do not really go down into our basement ever because that is kind of part of my dads living space.|12782
When I walked down there my worst nightmare came true, something no sister, mother, father or loved one should ever see.|12782
It was surreal as I saw My brother laying face down on the floor.|12782
I ran to him to turn him over and there was no pulse.|12782
I shot into panic mode, when the ambulance got there they rushed him to the hospital.|12782
Where he laid in the same bed for a week.|12782
I could not ever describe the pain I went through as I went to the hospital every day to see my brother.|12782
Seeing him laid up in a hospital bed with a machine that was breathing for him and all these tunes and wires that were helping him live.|12782
You see the thing is, he slipped into coma and no one knew how long he was going to be gone for.|12782
That week lasted a thousand years.|12782
I have never seen or felt the pain I experienced in that hospital room ever in my life and I hope to never feel it again.|12782
When the day came that he woke up, I happened to be walking into the room.|12782
He was already semi awake with a nurse in the room.|12782
"The nurse told him 'your sisters here to see you'"" and I think that is when he came back to reality."|12782
He was very confused at first about what happened, not remembering anything or how long he had been there.|12782
"He seemed upset at the fact that he was in coma but he just kept saying '""I wish I would have never lived'"" '""why did you have to find me'"" I felt an immense feeling at that moment."|12782
It really does something to you when you find someone you love no longer breathing, when they wake up and tell you they still do not want to live is even harder.|12782
Good news is to this day he is still here.|12782
Bad news is, it still effects me And our family will never be the same.|12782
"He still says things like '""I wish you would have never found me'"" suicide hurts the ones you love more then anyone could ever begin to comprehend."|12782
"I do not wish it on anyone."""|12782
I have not actually attempted to do anything, however I have a gun that I have been keeping under my pillow.|12782
I have held it to my head a few times just to see if I could picture myself pulling the trigger.|12782
I am not proud to admit that.|12782
I have been having extreme anxiety for the past six months because my partner of three and a half years left me, and I have been dealing with health issues.|12782
Because of the line of work I am in, I have to be careful of showing any mental health problems.|12782
The person whose position I filled actually took their own life several years ago.|12782
[BK][BK]I feel myself slipping away, at first it was slow, and now it has amped up.|12782
I barely sleep and my thoughts race a lot of the time.|12782
For awhile I was on Xanax, but that stuff is addicting and I made myself stop taking it.|12782
[BK][BK]I am having trouble coping with the loss of my relationship, and the loss of my sanity.|12782
My body cannot take any more stress, as it only makes my health issues worse.|12782
[BK][BK]The gun is under my pillow.|12782
I have it loaded with two hollow point bullets.|12782
I do not know where I would actually do it, because I would not want to around my dog and cats.|12782
[BK][BK]I have had to make myself almost blank out lately, because if I look at my mom, who is my best friend, it makes this so much harder.|12782
[BK][BK]I am ready to go.|12782
I am tired.|12782
I know a lot of people will probably be hurt, but I do not have the energy to live for other people anymore.|12782
[BK]I cannot believe I am typing this, and that this is my story.|12782
'Am I in a hospital bed?|12782
Am I alive?|12782

How long have I been out?|12782
I did not die.|12782
Damn.|12782
Here comes the psych ward.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I overdosed on prescription pills."|12782
I woke up 2-3 days later in a hospital bed on suicide watch.|12782
I was hooked up to several machines.|12782
My heart and lungs/breathing were being monitored.|12782
Also had an IV.|12782
There was always a hospital staff member in the room at all times.|12782
I remember kissing my children good bye (they were 2 & 3 years old at the time) and taking a bottle of sedatives.|12782
My husband at the time called 911.|12782
I remember laying down to sleep in my bed and wanting to never wake up.|12782
They were not sure of the pill count at the time or of how many I ingested.|12782
I was lucky to be alive.|12782
This was 10 years ago.|12782
I was diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder and PTSD in 2005.|12782
Still have suicide thoughts time to time, and the incident I mentioned was the only one I lost consciousness.|12782
"[BK][BK]I have been hospitalized at least 15 the since 2005, and have had several attempts that have failed. """|12782
"I lost a whole day after an AC (electricity) attempt; I was wondering 'Who''s this guy eating breakfast here?'"""|12782
"We''d interviewed a new housemate the day before."""|12782
I was a teenager.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up and immediately wondered what day it was, why it did not work, and then I checked to see if I had vomited the medication.|12782
I felt sick so I went upstairs and discovered that three days had gone by, I was poofy, and my father had not noticed that I was you know, not exactly alive or okay.|12782
He did not even know if I was in the house.|12782
[BK][BK]I moved out on my own not long after.|12782
I was 16.|12782
[BK][BK]I did not regret trying and I did not vow never to do it again.|12782
I just got on with it.|12782
[BK][BK]I felt sick for days.|12782
[BK][BK]*edit - a double negative|12782
I cannot even kill myself without fucking it up.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit -  I am in a great place now, and suicide is off the table forever.|12782
[BK][BK]If you have issues with depression, alcohol does not help.|12782
Shocked.|12782
The round had primed but never ignited.|12782
I was kind of bemused.|12782
I had no idea what to do so I got up and went to work.|12782
I was a little weird that day but eventually I was relieved.|12782
"'Shit.'"""|12782
I was super mad I was not successful.|12782
I was happy my mom was the first person I saw though.|12782
That year was really rough...I often still feel sad I was not successful.|12782
"I am bipolar so that explains a lot of my suicidal ideation."""|12782
Something like:  [BK][BK]'.........Well, shit.|12782
"That was Not fun.'"""|12782
"Mind you I was slowly[BK]regaining feeling in my face and fingers for the past 6 hours."""|12782
Right before I attempted, I thought things could not get any worse.|12782
I thought pills would be a more gentle / clean way to go than hanging myself or cutting my wrists.|12782
[BK][BK]While my ears were ringing and the mostly-full bottle of Excedrin was causing my stomach contents to expel themselves out from both ends, I thought 'this.|12782
"This is how things could be worse'""."|12782
[BK][BK]When I woke up next, with my mom having taken care of me with the stomach virus she thought I had, I cannot put into words exactly what I thought.|12782
It was a combination of guilt that my mom cared, depression that I could not even do this right, and a resolve that I would never do this again.|12782
Things can always get worse, which  means that there is something to be thankful for.|12782
"And just as quickly as things can get worse, they can also get better."""|12782
That I will try harder next time.|12782
:')|12782
'What the fuck??|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I put a revolver to my head and pulled the trigger but the round never went off."|12782
And yes I made sure it all worked before I tried.|12782
I proceeded to try two more times, none of the rounds ever went off.|12782
I still am near broke, still have debt that cant get paid, have no job currently, and almost no food left.|12782
I will never understand why the rounds never went off, but I am glad they did not despite the fact right now my life has not gotten any easier.|12782
The gun is gone now, and so are the rounds.|12782
[BK][BK][BK][BK]**Update**: 3 months later, and though chances are most wont go back and see my post in the chaos, I figured I should give an update for those who get curious and check back.|12782

Oddly enough I recieved that job offer a week after I posted the comment.|12782
Onwards and upwards, I wont stop or settle, I hit rock bottom and now it is time make my climb up.|12782
Alright world, lets see what you got, I am up for it!|12782
[BK][BK]Word of wisdom for you lurkers that just so happen to pass by and read this: Don''t lose hope no matter how bleak or alone you feel at the time.|12782
It could take days.|12782
It could take months.|12782
Shit, it could even take years before you see the light again, but just do not stop just because you are in a period of suffering or depression.|12782
[BK]And for those who say oh thats just bs, I have this problem or this problem and I have never been able to escape it, I feel for you and understand your pain.|12782
I am open to admit I have dyslexia and bipolar disorder.|12782
I know what its like cuz I live it myself daily.|12782
It just means we have to fight harder then most, and keep pushing regardless; everyday you complete is a victory.|12782

'[BK][BK]No throwaway because I think I have told a few people.|12782
[BK][BK]Years ago I was in a terrible place emotionally.|12782
I was not suicidal per se but I was not in love with the idea of being alive.|12782
I would never want to actually off myself but if i was ever in a life-or-death situation, i sure as hell would not fight to stay alive.|12782
I realize now how cowardly that was.|12782
[BK][BK]One night I was walking home late at night across town and I was mugged by two dudes with guns.|12782
Perfect opportunity.|12782
I remember just egging them on to shoot me, trying to piss them off by not complying by handing over my wallet and whatever and just repeatedly screaming the n-word (they were black).|12782
I did not care, hopefully I would be dead soon and I could be permanently away from my waking self, my brain that produced all of this self-hatred and misery.|12782
[BK][BK]They beat the hell out of me, pistol whipped my head several times and gave me some rad scars on my hands but did not shoot me.|12782
Turns out those pussies only had fake airsoft guns.|12782
But when I woke up in the hospital with a concussion and a crazy head wound with my dad crying at bedside, all I could think was now I will be known as the deathwish racist.|12782
[BK][BK]The incident really knocked sense into me.|12782
Your life does not suck, you miserable sadsack, there are many many people that love you unconditionally.|12782
I have been doing infinitely better emotionally ever since.|12782
[BK][BK]Please, it is been said in this thread hundreds of times but it bears repeating thousands more: if you are having thoughts of self-harm or suicide or depression or what have you, please seek help.|12782
If you are uncomfortable seeing a therapist, talk to a friend, a teacher, a trusted member of the clergy, just talk to someone who will listen.|12782
Hell, you can talk to any of us in this thread.|12782
We've been there and we will not judge you.|12782
We love you and many people in your lives love you and that is a fact.|12782

"'Well this is embarrassing.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]I tried to hang myself from the railing on my garage overhead door opener.|12782
I let myself down easy and knocked the chair i was standing on over and just relaxed.|12782
I passed out pretty quickly.|12782
It was over.|12782
I had a bad drug problem and this was my alternative to jail and rehab.|12782
[BK][BK]Right after I knocked out the chair I was standing on from under me, or shortly thereafter, the railing collapsed and I fell free to the floor.|12782
Blood continued to pump into my brain and I suffered no permanent effects physically.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up to my mother and brother standing over me shaking me.|12782
I guess my mom found I still had a pulse and they were just trying to revive me.|12782
I Just felt embarrassed for everyone, mostly myself.|12782
[BK][BK]I went out and got as high as I could afford that night.|12782
A week later I had a DUI accident where I fell asleep at the wheel on heroin and cocaine.|12782
Detox in jail and then a really nice rehab in Utah were paid for by my family and I stayed there a year.|12782

"i knew where it wanted to take me, I have been having dreams and hallucinations about going to that place for hours now, but i just said, as lowd as i can, '""not today'""."|12782
[BK][BK]i have no idea how it came out from me though.|12782
[BK][BK]at that moment my mother realized i am awake, she came to me to tell me good morning, she spoke some stuff i cannot remember; but i remember the fact that i could not respond to her, i do not know why.|12782
"[BK][BK][BK][BK]it was at that moment i realized that I am '""still there'"", i was not sure if I am alive or not, but i was there[BK][BK][BK][BK]i was kinda paralyzed, could,t move, so i started thinking, is this death ?"|12782
am i just a soul watching all this ?|12782
moments later i started thinking that i died last night, and I am just bound to watch myself till i get buried or something[BK][BK][BK]later, after i was done with the thought of me being dead, i realized I am alive, but maybe with locked in syndrome or something similar.|12782
[BK][BK]it was so scary, what will i do now ?|12782
how will i respond to my mother when she comes soon to wake me for school ?|12782
it was really scary.|12782

"[BK][BK]i was like, goddamit it did not work, how the fuck do you kill yourself these days... i just wanna die..[BK][BK]then i proceeded to have slurred speech and hallucinations for the rest of the day, having the worst fever, headache, stomach ache, nausea and muscle spasms of my life[BK][BK][BK]5/10 would od on cough medicine ^^^^aka ^^^^DXM again"""|12782
I cant even end my own life.|12782
There are no words.|12782
Just the panic and worry over how I was going to hide this boch job from my friends and loved ones.|12782
I am found help.|12782
Medication can REALLY help.|12782
Pm me if you are on the fence about getting help or need resources.|12782
Ooohhh, something I can contribute to!|12782
[BK][BK]Anyways, I guess I was happy I was being taken seriously for my illness after that.|12782
I was turned away a few days before my attempt when I said I needed help, as they said the only thing they could really do is give me a bed, and that they could not really help me.|12782
[BK][BK]The issue with clinical depression/anxiety disorder is, if you have had it a while, you do not look depressed.|12782
You get used to hiding it, to the point where you cannot really get across the idea that you need help to someone who probably comes across a bunch of teens who are going through a phase... so you need to do something drastic to be taken seriously.|12782
[BK][BK]I know while I was in the ambulance and still thought I was going to die that it was the most relaxed I would ever been in my life.|12782
I did not have to fight anymore, it was over, and I could just sit back and let it happen.|12782
Looks like im here to stay.|12782
[BK][BK]Ate a shit ton of sleeping pills and ended up just vomiting on the carpet and shoes.|12782
Dogs came,foster mom found me on the floor with the mess I made to myself, took me to a doctor, got sent to a shrink for two years.|12782
Told them I wouldnt do it again, it seems too easy and honestly I would like to see more of what life has to offer.|12782
within those two years I met my closest friends, there is more to life than in death.|12782
It's a weird answer for me because I was not in my right mind when I attempted.|12782
The intent was there, but also the world was not really real and things did not really matter and I was probably kind of invincible anyway?|12782
[BK][BK]So I actually was happily succeeding until I came down from the crazy a little bit and realised I had a number of hours left before organ failure would be beyond the point of no return, at which point I decided to go to hospital.|12782
[BK][BK]Once I would finished listening to the album I was, of course.|12782
(Like I said, not right mind.|12782
)[BK][BK]I did not find out I was actually going to live for another 24 hours after that.|12782
I think I just focused on the practical - I needed to get a taxi home, so that the friend who knew I was there would know I was safe.|12782

It was a cry for help.|12782
I am bipolar so I than ago and the doctors that they were watching back!|12782
I had an entirely different outlooook on like.|12782
I have been on medications ever since and its a miracle one you filed my clarity.|12782

Never give up!|12782
You could save a life :).|12782
Quack doctor was treating me for depression.|12782
Every time I saw him he asked how I was feeling.|12782
I was just getting wise so he kept upping the dosage.|12782
"Flash forward about two weeks to me lying in my kitchen floor with a box cutter next to me with 1/2 of my 'total volume'"" running out when my wife and the 3yo came home."|12782
She was not supposed to be there.|12782
She had left to go shopping and should not have been back for hours.|12782
After a brief hospital stay with competent doctors it turns out I am bipolar type 1 with ice and anxiety disorder.|12782
Also, I was on twice the max dosage of the wrong drug that caused my psychotic break.|12782

"[BK]- High school senior"""|12782
I never actually made an attempt myself, but I did get very close a few times.|12782
I did not feel connected to anyone, I had no one I felt I could talk to, no one that would understand, always kept on the outside.|12782
[BK][BK]But one day it just clicked for me that it had be the most selfish thing I could do.|12782
That if I did commit suicide then I would be putting the people I care about and the people that cared about me (whether I knew they did or not) through the same thing or so much worse, and I just could not do that.|12782
[BK][BK]And I may not be happy all the time now by any means, but even when things suck the most, I just think, 'These people here still need me.|12782
My friends, my family, even someone I have not met yet.|12782

"I see that this seems to be a thing a lot of us think, but 'shit, do my parents know?'"""|12782
is also the first thing that came to my mind.|12782
And my brother, I felt really guilty about that part.|12782
My bro and I are super close, and having to look everyone in the face after all the shit I put them through because of the shit I did thanks to depression.|12782
For anybody wondering, I had depression which led to insomnia, and all the shrinks and psychiatrists just gave me one pill after another, for sleep and depression, and that ended in me abusing them pretty hard, and mixing them with alcohol.|12782
It turned into an almost daily thing.|12782
OD''d pretty hard on that stuff.|12782
In the past though, just some scars and memories left to remember that stuff.|12782
"[BK][BK]It really does get better, as cliché as that sounds."""|12782
I felt so sick.|12782
Then ashamed.|12782
Then mad that I had failed, but mostly I hurt and I was throwing up over and over.|12782
Turns out my opiate tolerance was too strong for the amount of heroin I chose (about 3/4ths of a gram).|12782
In the weeks after I thought about what a failure I was for not just using the shotgun, and sometimes I still do.|12782
Well, lots of the time.|12782
I am working on it, but the feelings are not gone.|12782
I was age 16.|12782
It was something like, 'I cannot believe I am awake.|12782
"'""[BK]I took a lot but I did not know it was practically impossible to overdose on asprin."""|12782
I woke up really confused and tried to remember what I was just doing; hanging myself.|12782
[BK][BK]I was 19 and was 6 months into sobriety after rehab, living with a minister who was a second mom to me.|12782
She and her husband were on a cruise and her older son was celebrating his birthday that day.|12782
I decided that the world had given up on me, breaking up with my addict boyfriend is what I needed to do... And could not handle it.|12782
[BK][BK]I called my then boyfriend and he was so upset he told me not to tell anybody and that he could help me.|12782
I knew he was wrong and that was not love.|12782
[BK]I called my councillor from rehab/my addictions group and she literally drove across town and took me to the hospital.|12782
I had purple marking all around my neck, skinned my spine along something when the rope I hung myself with broke while I was unconscious.|12782
[BK]We decided going back to rehab for 3 months was the best, and I had no neck injuries from my hanging.|12782
[BK][BK]I am not going to say it was easy, I broke up with that boyfriend, stayed single for over a year, worked on my recovery, and attended what I had always wanted in college: animation.|12782
[BK][BK]It is now 3 years later in my sobriety and almost 3 years since, and I start my final year of animation in September.|12782
I am also dating a wonderful and truly loving man who is not afraid to tell me the truth and helps me best he can; with REAL love.|12782
I have a fantastic relationship with my rehab group, family, and the minister whom I lived with.|12782
I sometimes have hard days but am moving farther away from thoughts of suicide because I really truly cannot bear to hurt the people I love so much in my life today.|12782
[BK][BK]Please do not give up!|12782
Don't end your life over a boy, or over anybody in your life.|12782
You are SO important, and even more important to the people who love you and we will never understand how much we are truly loved!|12782
To all the people who are reading this and feel depressed and/or suicidal:[BK][BK] [BK]DO NOT GIVE UP.|12782
I know, you probably hear this all the time, and you might just shrug it off.|12782
But seriously, think about it.|12782
Look at all these stories of people that survive.|12782
Chances are they would tell you that looking back, if they have succeeded, it would have been the worst mistake of their lives, and the last.|12782
[BK][BK] [BK] [BK]I know your world might seem really bad, and you might think that it is better to end it all, but when you end it all, you end it all.|12782
No more chances to find happiness.|12782
Not reversible.|12782
There is not Ctrl+Z to life.|12782
All the people that love you (and trust me, there is always someone that loves you, no matter what you are thinking otherwise) will be filled with grief.|12782
Do you really want them to go through the same thing you are going through right now?|12782
The first thought I had was how bad my neck and knees hurt when I hit the ground.|12782
[BK][BK]You know, sometimes I think about it and wonder if this is not all in my head.|12782
Just the way the noose came untied from the beam... it does not make since to me sometimes.|12782
I am happy to be alive but sometimes I think I am crazy to excite the possibility that the entire reality I exist in right now is not one just conjured up by my brain in a last ditch effort to show me what could had been.|12782
Noticing weird patterns in things and strange coincidences...|12782
I still live life like it was real though, but I always have this lingering thought of what if.|12782
"[BK][BK]This is why I have come to live by the quote 'I think, therefore I am'"" [BK]I think I am alive, so I am... alive i guess.... idk its strange that this has stuck with me."|12782

'Why could not I go through with it?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I tried a few times to kill myself by strangulation and once by suffocation."|12782
Each time, the panic and pain took over and caused me to loosen the noose or take the bag over my head.|12782
[BK][BK]I would always wonder why I backed out, why I could not wait until I fell unconscious.|12782
Then it would all have been over.|12782
I felt like a complete fuck up.|12782
I was not strong enough to continue living, and I was not strong enough to commit to dying.|12782
I still regret being too weak to go though with it.|12782
But now I have accepted that I will not really ever have the determination to go through with it.|12782
"[BK][BK]Sorry for the poorly written rambling, I just kinda wanted to get it off my chest."""|12782
I have five fingers on this hand, two plus two equal four.|12782
Still functioning, better get to class, I do not want to be late!|12782
I felt like I had disapointed my whole family.|12782
Seing the look on my fathers face when I woke up was the worst thing I have ever experienced.|12782
[BK][BK]Now in retrospect, I cannot believe that 18-year old me could make such a stupid decision!|12782
18-year old me was really stupid and did not know what he was gambling with|12782
i am a single 36 year old adult, and i still cannot fully come to grips with the fact that nobody gives a shit if i am here or not except for my parents.|12782

"'The one fucking time they use the furthermost tracks to go that direction...'""[BK][BK]Anyway, I had finally had enough."|12782
I decided to get completely platered and sit in front of the tracks and wait for a train.|12782
I do not remember the walk there so much.|12782
Just kinda remember being there.|12782
[BK][BK]The tracks were only a half mile away from my house, and about 200 or so feet down the road on the tracks became entirely shrouded due to trees and whatnot.|12782
So nobody driving by would be able to see even as much as my silhouette.|12782
Perfect way to die.|12782
Just wait for it to come while I am entirely numb.|12782
[BK][BK]Now, here''s the thing, there are three sets of tracks.|12782
The first go right, the second go left, and the third just has stray carts.|12782
[BK][BK]I waited between the first and second ones, and saw a train coming from about 3 miles away (it may be surrounded by trees, but it is a straight shot and I can see the light).|12782
It was going right, so I sat upright, facing away from it on the first set of tracks.|12782
I felt no nervousness, no fear, nothing.|12782
Just total apathy.|12782
[BK][BK]Then the train passed me.|12782
And I almost immediately sobered up, or at least enough to remember everything entirely clearly.|12782
"[BK][BK]I then thought to myself  '""Well, I tried, back home I go.'"""|12782
I do not even remotely understand my reasoning at that moment.|12782
I could have easily just waited for another train.|12782
I was full prepared to die.|12782
I had organized all of my belongings and wrote out my suicide note.|12782
[BK][BK]I still had no desire to live, but I guess I just lost my motivation to die.|12782
[BK][BK]I remember every step on my way home.|12782
That was also probably the best nights sleep I have ever had.|12782
"[BK][BK]I then woke up crying out of guilt and shame."""|12782
After the 7th unsuccessful time (during my pre-teen and teen years) I knew if God did not want to take me back, he must have placed me here in this world for a reason and so I decided to stop messing with that 'reason'[BK][BK]I am still here and man I still struggle every single day, but I see my family (what is left of it), some of my good friends (what is left of them) and I think about my good health and I try to hold onto those small happy factors and I guess I am not great, but I am good and that is okay.|12782
This is going to be buried but my first thought was that I was annoyed I was still alive|12782
I am disappointed in myself.|12782
When the pills started to kick in, I remember thinking:[BK][BK]- Regret that a) I tried at all, and b) trying at night.|12782
I vowed that next time I tried it would be during the day; I wanted so badly to see and feel the sun again.|12782
[BK][BK]- Horror and fear realizing that my parents would be the ones to find me.|12782
Or worse, my little brother.|12782
[BK][BK]- Horror and fear at the thought that it might not work, and I would have to go school again the next day.|12782
(Incidentally, this exact fear is the sole reason I decided not to try and drown myself while on a school trip the following year.|12782
)[BK][BK]- Relief, shame, fear, helplessness, hopelessness, desperation once I realized I would still live.|12782
[BK][BK]I was 12; for the past 17 years I find myself thinking of that awful night at least once a day.|12782
I spent the following 10 years trapped in a vicious cycle of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.|12782
[BK][BK]I am mostly better now, but I still have my bad days.|12782
"So far everyone here seems to share the same response of 'Fuck...'"" then a pause to realize what comes next."|12782
[BK][BK]When I failed in my suicide attempts, I felt the same way, but the thinking that followed suit may be the same and I am hoping someone can share with me if they felt similarly.|12782
Afterwards, it wasnt as if my depression had magically cleared and my head was still cloudy from the act itself, but I had a thought that maybe this wasnt the right choice.|12782
I didnt die, I kept thinking about why I didnt just fucking die, why I wasnt swept from the earth, and took it as an opportunity to move forward.|12782
I am not dead now, so I think my motivation for life is on the rise.|12782
"[BK][BK]Nothing is perfect, everyone lives and died for their own reasons, but it brought some clarity to my issues, issues that could be resolved without my death. """|12782

Literally, fml.|12782
Well, shit.|12782
*That* did not work.|12782
"Well, the first time I failed, I can clearly remember thinking, 'I guess it did not work.'"""|12782
It was not special or anything.|12782
There was no seeing the light or anything like that.|12782
It was so ordinary and plain.|12782
Something everyone goes through.|12782
I am not saying everyone has a failed suicide attempt, but it just felt like one of those moments in life that everyone goes through, so it is not exactly something you bookmark in life.|12782
And I guess that lack of feeling made me bookmark it and remember.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]I had just tried to kill myself and all I could think was that it did not work.|12782
You''d think there would be something, but there was nothing.|12782
Looking back, it makes me really sad.|12782
I cared so little about my life and I was not even in high school.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]If I had succeeded, I would not have made all these memories I now hold dear.|12782
So many things have happened since then and I would have missed it.|12782
That makes me wish I had cared after seeing I was still alive.|12782
Why could not I have seen that I was given another shot?|12782
Instead, I tried again months after that and still saw my life as insignificant.|12782
I felt that way for a long time after and still do at times even now, but...I do not want to die.|12782
There''s still too much to do and I have someone I want to experience life with - with the baby I am going to bring into the world soon.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]Even if I was not then, I am so grateful now that I failed.|12782
Things got easier and life got better.|12782
"I am so happy I did not miss it."""|12782
this was 5 years ago and i am healthy and not suicidal anymore, i have ADHD which somehow resulted in bipolar tendencies or whatever, i actually laugh at this everytime i think about it.|12782
After my first attempt.|12782

"'""[BK]but unlike the first time, after the second attempt i somehow changed."|12782
i started appreciating things alot more and i do not get angry at alot of things.|12782
i have the general mindset that life is to short to be pissed about stupid things (unless you loose in something like monopoly or a video game.|12782
then, i reak havoc.|12782
)[BK]so i am actually somewhat thankfull that i tried a second time.|12782
"if i did not, i most likely would have still been depressed today."""|12782
I was 17 at the time.|12782
Jumped from 9 stories, landed on concrete pavement (through a few branches better suited to be classified as twigs).|12782
I woke up hurting on my thigh/hip and shoulder.|12782
Had a really bad bruise on my hip and what felt like a sprained wrist.|12782
[BK][BK]It was 3:30 am and I was sleepy so I went home back to bed and slept.|12782
When I did try to slowly bring the topic up some days later, no one in the family took me seriously so I decided I was not going to bother talking to any of them about it.|12782
Some of my close friends knew, though, not that they could do much.|12782
"[BK][BK]Prior to being conscripted into the army, their 'doctors'"" did not believe me either when I checked the box asking if you had ever attempted suicide."""|12782
Well, I used prescription Zoloft to do it and all the beer and liquor I could sneak from my parents without them noticing.|12782
My first thought was 'Great.|12782
"Not only am I alive, I am alive with a massive hangover, I have no more Zoloft left so these next few weeks are going to be absolute hell since I cannot tell anybody why I ran out so I will have to live without it, and'"", like someone said earlier, '""I have to get ready for school tomorrow.'"""|12782
This was a couple months ago.|12782
I am doing better.|12782
I had missed a lot of school prior to that, because I was running away from home a lot.|12782
Once I got back, the work I had to make up was extremely overwhelming.|12782
Junior year is already stressful, but my home life has been far worse.|12782
I did not even think I could graduate and would get kicked out of private school.|12782
Home still is not better, but the fact that now I have a license and the thought of being 18 in just months from now is giving me hope.|12782
I chose to forgo therapy for the rest of the year since I need all the time I can to do especially well in school for the rest of the year to make up for how shitty I did, but I am also reconsidering.|12782
"I would like to have someone to talk to again."""|12782
Had alot of ptsd and depression after the 'stan.|12782
I loaded up my 9mm and put it to my head pulled the trigger.|12782
The round had a bad primer(junk rounds from walmart).|12782
I didnt sleep for a week after that, then after watching the sun rise and set everyday that week my numbness stopped..|12782
I broke down sobbing and crying and switching between crying and laughing hysterically for hours on end.|12782
Then I crashed hard for two days.|12782
Slept like a baby.|12782
[BK][BK]My experience came with some type of clarity that I really cant explain..|12782
I can only say it gave me an understanding and tranquility about my own existence that I carry to this day.|12782

well mine was simple ''if at first you do not succeed try again''|12782
The very first thing I remember is waking up and shaking in the middle of the night.|12782
I could not control it and I just hoped I would go back to sleep and the pills would take effect.|12782
The next morning I woke up and the first thing I did was start to cry.|12782
It had been another thing I failed at, another thing I was not good enough at doing.|12782
It just further solidified to me that I was a fuck up.|12782
[BK][BK]That day was pretty rough for me - I went to school and acted like nothing happened and during my free period called a suicide hotline.|12782
Honestly, it took a lot of will and strength not to try again that night and I am happy I did not.|12782
Basically, the way I looked at it was I would hit rock bottom.|12782
This was going to be my lowest low and there would not be anything that would make me feel worse, so I may as well give life another shot.|12782
[BK][BK]This was about 7 years ago now and I have put my suicidal thoughts behind me, but it was a struggle.|12782
My first psychiatrist diagnosed me as bipolar and I was on the wrong medication up until college when I had to take a medical leave my second semester and finally saw a new doctor when I got home.|12782
[BK][BK]A couple years ago I got off anti-depressants entirely and I think that is something people do not really realize you can do (I know my mom did not understand it).|12782
Sure, it is not for everyone, but in my case I was in a completely different situation at the time of my attempt and the worst of my depression.|12782
When I got off my meds I was probably 5 years older, going to college, around a new group of people, even in a different state.|12782
To me, it was worth it to go through a monitored withdrawal to see if I could function normally without them.|12782
That said, there is nothing wrong with people who do need to continue to take them for longer periods of time.|12782
Fuck.|12782
Who found me?|12782
I hope it was not my parents.|12782
They would be devastated.|12782
Wait.|12782
I am not at the hospital.|12782
Why is my room so clean.|12782
WHERE THE FUCK ARE MY RAZERS??|12782
Damn my neck hurts like a bitch.|12782
How did I end up in my bed?|12782
Shit it is 10am I missed school!|12782
My mom is going to kill me.|12782
Why the fuck could I not just be left alone to die?|12782
[BK][BK][BK][BK]I hung myself.|12782
My brother said he heard something and came to check on me.|12782
(I used to tell my brother all about sports med classes so he knows how to check vitals) so he cut the rope, I was passed out but had a strong heart beat and he did not notice anything wrong with my breathing.|12782
So he picked me up and put me in bed.|12782
He said I woke up shortly after but he told me to go to sleep.|12782
"'I will tell mom you feel like shit and you should stay home from school'""[BK][BK]The reason he did not take me to the hospital was because we both know that my mom does not know how to deal with these things."|12782
She makes these things worse.|12782
It''s not her fault.|12782
But she does.|12782
He knew I was okay and breathing and I was semi conscious.|12782
"(Not smart but I thank him for it)[BK][BK]Me and my brother have always '""hated'"" each other."|12782
We fight a lot and we both find each other annoying.|12782
But after that.|12782
It''s never been the same.|12782
We have gotten so close since then.|12782
We just took a vacation to Vegas.|12782
We hang out a lot.|12782
I love him.|12782
[BK][BK]Remember guys.|12782
People that are suicidal, they just need someone that is there for them.|12782
Someone they trust.|12782
"Don''t be the person to run and tell everyone that they are suicidal."""|12782
Shit, I was so messed up around that time I actually did not remember I had done it until I had been sober for a few months.|12782
I was fucking horrified.|12782
[BK][BK]I was really bad off on some stuff after my kid''s mom left me.|12782
In a haze one night, I swallowed the rest of my bottle of Tylenol PM, about 15 extra strength pills.|12782
I woke up maybe 16 hours later and went to work.|12782
I saw the pill bottle on the coffee table but it just did not really click.|12782
I mean, I knew what I had done.|12782
I guess I cannot really explain it.|12782
I just kind of put it in the back of my mind and went about my shattered life.|12782
[BK][BK]I checked into rehab a few weeks later after an extremely painful detox, got sober, and became happy again.|12782
I vividly remember the day I finally felt the warmth of the sun on my skin again.|12782
About two months after checking in, I was at a meeting and someone was talking about their suicide attempt.|12782
Everything came flooding back and hit my like a ton of bricks.|12782
I had to leave the room to regain my composure.|12782
[BK][BK]It took another two years before I told someone: my kid''s mom.|12782
She was being really ugly to me about something I had said or done and I begged her to stop.|12782
She was telling me that I was vile and disgusting and she never wanted to see me again.|12782
She told me that everyday for the past 3 years she regretted having a child with me.|12782
Our beautiful son.|12782
She said if it was up to her, they would move far away and I would never see either of them again.|12782
She said loving me wa the biggest mistake she had ever made, and that she hated that I was the father of her child.|12782
That she shivers at the thought of me being in the same room with her.|12782
That I will never so much as hug her again.|12782
We have not made physical contact since, and she is visibly uncomfortable every time I am around.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway, I begged her to stop saying those things.|12782
In the confusion of what was happening, I told her that the last time she treated me this way, I tried to kill myself.|12782
I regret that.|12782
"She called me a 'fucking liar.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]After a little while, I guess she believed me.|12782
She told me if I was going to kill myself to please do it right now, before our son was old enough to remember me.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not hold it against her.|12782
Her mother had just died, her boyfriend had just cheated on her while her father was in town visiting after the funeral.|12782
She had also just lost her job.|12782
I really do not think I caused her to say those things.|12782
She actually called a week later and apologized for saying all that to me.|12782
I thanked her for the apology, but foolishly asked if she was just apologizing for hurting me or if she actually meant it.|12782
She apologized for hurting me.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: I am sorry, that is really long.|12782
I did not mean to write so much.|12782
You guys do not have to read it.|12782
[BK][BK]TL;DR: I forgot I tried to do it for a couple months.|12782
"I have only told one person, she did not believe me. """|12782
When I was 15 I tried to overdose on my brothers sleeping medication.|12782
"I took 40 or so pills (and I threw up some of them an hour later or so because my friend convinced me to)[BK][BK]I remember waking up and thinking along the lines of faking sick so I did not have to go to work experience for the day, but my mum came in to wake me up and saw all the pill packets and my 'I am sorry'"" note and called an ambulance."|12782
[BK][BK]On the way the paramedics tried to keep me awake, but I just ignored them and went back to sleep.|12782
In fact I spent most of the day and a half hospital stay asleep.|12782
The only times I did wake up was when my dad visited with muffins, and overnight where I constantly had to get out of bed to pee.|12782
[BK][BK]In some ways I am glad I did not die that day because I went on to meet some amazing people and have some really unique experiences.|12782
"[BK][BK]This event shaped me for the better I believe though, I got the help I needed, I got my diagnoses of Aspergers, depression and anxiety which helped me to realise why it was so hard for me to relate to people."""|12782
After my first (and luckily only) attempt at suicide I woke up scared sad and glad that I was alive...|12782
I had taken a mix of pills trying to kill myself but I guess dosage was not enough for more than just making me pass out (I am fat I guess it saved me) I still think back about it and honestly I am glad it did not work.|12782
After that I remember being sick, whether it was mental or physical from the pills I am not sure.|12782
Never went to the hospital or told my parents.|12782
Bummer.|12782
"'damn it'"""""|12782
I took almost 3 bottles of extra strength Advil, my parents dragged me to the hospital after I tried to just go to sleep.|12782
My first conscious thought after I attempted it and realized I failed is that no one believed me.|12782
I was sitting in the hospital bed with an IV in after blood and urine tests and all of them came back negative.|12782
[BK][BK]Everyone thought I did it just for attention and called me stupid, I did not and do not understand how none of it was picked up by the tests.|12782
[BK][BK]I was only 14 and I realized how stupid I was, when all of my friends from my football team were sitting in the lobby close to tears or crying.|12782
It was very emotional.|12782
My entire school started a hashtag 'praying' for my good health.|12782
[BK][BK]I ended up staying in a Psych Ward for a month in a nearby hospital.|12782
I was constantly thinking I was okay, and that it was a stupid idea.|12782
Still no one believed me, I cried when they let my mom visit for 15 minutes and I just hugged her.|12782
[BK][BK]The other people in there showed me how much worse other people had it.|12782
They all constantly told me in their free time that my life was perfect, I had so much, and why would I do what I did.|12782
I would tell them just how I felt (how at the time I would just think deeply about there really being no point to existence) but, none of them could quite grasp how I was feeling.|12782
[BK][BK]TLDR; I felt confused.|12782
I did not understand why no one believed what I said just because I tried to commit suicide.|12782
And I had my eyes opened to how much worse people had it.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: I am now accepted into my local colleges Nursing program, I want to return the favor, and save peoples lives.|12782
If anyone needs someone to talk to I am here for you!|12782
:-)|12782
I was upset that I would totaled my car and I was desperately trying to find a way to drive it home without having to call the police or a tow truck.|12782
No such luck.|12782
I do not have a cellphone with service so I could only call 911.|12782
After I called I realized I would need a story and so I told the cop my tire blew out (which it had, after impact) and he seemed to believe me fine.|12782
Didn't even ask if I would been drinking or anything (which I had not been).|12782
[BK][BK]This was a about a month ago, give or take a few days, and it was the easily the lowest point in my life mentally.|12782
I have been recovering really well.|12782
My car was not actually totaled, it just needed a good few parts and a couple tires and it was right as rain.|12782
[BK][BK]I think I needed to get that low before I could really start recovering.|12782
I do not know.|12782
It's always darkest before the dawn, they say.|12782
[BK][BK]It's strange how this is not even close to being the worst part of my life and yet it is been so impossible shaking the misery.|12782
Mental illness has been so fucked up and I am so glad I seem to be getting past it.|12782
Regret, not about trying but rather not succeeding I actually became much more depressed  that I was still alive and this furthered more desire to die more at the time.|12782
[BK][BK]If I may offer any advice to anyone considering taking their life.|12782
I have been there and all I ask of you is to try to make your life better through any means possible first.|12782
You feel like you have nothing to lose right?|12782
So you also have nothing to lose if you seek help.|12782
I thought the shotgun was loaded.|12782
I thought I had loaded it months ago.|12782
When I pulled the trigger and it did not go off...well I cried for over an hour and then cut myself.|12782
I am still avoiding my family because of how deep the cuts are.|12782
I texted two people 30 minutes after I took all the pills.|12782
100 or so nexium (threw up so I did not finish them all), some antibiotics (like 40 total?|12782
), 20 zofran, 30 propranolol.|12782
Avoided antidepressants.|12782
Went to bed, woke up 4 hrs later and I knew I failed, was in a lot of pain, throwing up, dizzy and loss of balance.|12782
Texted them never mind.|12782
[BK][BK]Went to class, throwing up semi often but never in an actual class.|12782
I had a very metallic taste from flagyl, so I could not eat or drink, and if I did it had be thrown up in an hour anyways.|12782
Talked to my professors via email about missing an exam since I realized I wanted to live and was given another chance (my first OD was in 2014 but with much less medicine).|12782
I remember talking magnesium citrate hoping it had flush out the stuff and I would be okay, tried brushing my teeth for the taste and threw it all up instantly.|12782
Breathing hurt, abdominal region was in a lot of pain (I already had abdominal pain, just worse).|12782
Went to ER, got a bunch of tests and I did not mention ODing to anyone.|12782
They gave me IV zofran so I would stop puking, and provided me with fluids and after 20 hours I got to eat real food.|12782
[BK][BK]Never told anyone until now what actually happened, I had a bunch of the symptoms prior because of something else, so the OD just made it a bit worse.|12782
I also apparently killed the h. pylori infection I had since I am now negative for it, but I am still here somehow, so I have been trying to make something out of it.|12782
Not sure if it counts but fuck it.|12782
"It was in 2012, the middle of my self-hanging (I started choking and gasping for air) and I remember a part of me said to myself 'You''re better than this, you bitch.'"""|12782
So I desperately grasped onto the belt I was dangling from and managed to unbuckle it before crashing into a heaving mess on the floor.|12782
[BK]I tried multiple times few months later before fully believing I was worth it in this world.|12782
"The belt, I hang it up as a reminder of those dark times and make myself remember where I am now and how far I have come; a high achieving student at Uni with a stable casual job."""|12782
"Seriously it was 'fuck did I leave the oven on?!'"""""|12782
'Fuck, I missed.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I tried to stab my heart."|12782
"I ended up puncturing a lung."""|12782
First thought was about my family, what they would go through if I had died that night, screamed my lungs out and vowed to make every moment count.|12782
[BK][BK]Shouldn''t have done it but glad did it and I am alive, my whole life changed.|12782
I share my experience with almost everyone who needs help so that they do not have to go through what I have gone through, saved atleast 14 different people by talking them out of it.|12782
"[BK][BK]I am glad that I did not 'succeed'"""""|12782
Tried to OD on xanax and sleeping meds.|12782
Slept from 3PM to 10AM.|12782
"The first thing I thought when I woke up was 'fuck I want a coffee'""."|12782
"Shortly after came the guilt, regret and worry."""|12782
Mine was just like many others in this thread: 'Really?|12782
I am still here?|12782
"NO!'"""|12782
[BK][BK]I OD''d on OTC pain meds, but for many years prior I was abusing them.|12782
I saw it as something I could control.|12782
Something special because no one realized I was doing it.|12782
No on realized I tried to kill myself until years after when I finally told them.|12782
It was hurtful.|12782
I have a crappy family.|12782
They did not even believe me when I told them.|12782
They thought I was lying to get attention.|12782
After everything I have been through, after everything they have put me through and they thought it was an attention grab.|12782
[BK][BK]I absolutely hated them.|12782
The hate lessens and then it pops back up and makes me miserable again.|12782
It does not help I am still living with them because of my depression and anxiety.|12782
I have no one else.|12782
No other family.|12782
I distanced myself from friends and after HS we lost contact.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyways, I remember the day after because I woke up with the worst stomach ache and it lasted for days.|12782
I remember getting online and finding out Heath Ledger died of an OD the same night.|12782
(this was the day after) As weird as it sounds, I thought it was my fault.|12782
That I had caused it.|12782
So I felt even more guilty.|12782
I went to tell my sister that HL died and she just blew it off.|12782
I was soaking in tears and she did not understand why I was so upset.|12782
[BK][BK]And before this moment, I never got into admiring celebrities, so it was really off for me to be so emotional when he died.|12782
[BK][BK]I still do not have the answer.|12782
I am still depressed and anxious.|12782
I still am surrounded by horrible people.|12782
Uncertain of my future.|12782
It is just horrible.|12782
I do not ever see myself being happy again.|12782
I cannot go to the doctor because I do not have insurance and because of my anxiety.|12782
I am stuck in limbo and have been for the past 15 years.|12782
"I have spent more of my life suffering from sadness than I have been happy."""|12782
It was something like 'Fuck, what did I do wrong?|12782
"why did not this work?'"""|12782
"I had tried to gas myself with helium but I never lost consciousness, just became extremely light headed."""|12782
Utter disappointment.|12782
And then after I threw up lots, relief because I remembered that my mum would have been the one to find me and she did not deserve that from me,  no matter how bad I was feeling.|12782
'I am so sorry I could not even do this right, I will do it better next time, I will not fail you again, I am so sorry.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Directed at my father."|12782
Because his life would have been so much better had this monstrosity in the shape of a female daughter by a woman who turned out to be a whore never entered it.|12782
[BK][BK]But actually, there were not many thoughts, I was delirious.|12782
After the vomiting and the blood, it was all just...so placid.|12782
"I saw the blood but the instinct of '""this is very wrong'"" would not kick in."|12782
I was just watching the crimson spirals wondering what my esophagus must look like and that it is odd that my vision is blurring.|12782
Ever the perfectionist, plagued with an eating disorder, I always had that panic that I would lose control and fail - and suddenly, that person was not strong enough to torture me.|12782
I was a child again.|12782
It felt like a gentle electric hum was surrounding my hearing, I drifted off into a faraway memory I never thought was there, to where I was a kiddy and safe and sound and loved, no rape, no starving, no failures...and I stayed there.|12782
[BK]Then I jerked myself back, I have no idea how.|12782
"I know that one moment I was safe and '""not there'"" so to speak with that gentle hum that felt like a caress on the mind, the other the world was suddenly real, chaotic, raw."|12782
"Primal instincts set in, like '""pain pain scared scared not safe get help cold so cold sick smells bad throat aches taste copper'"" and then...just so much regret."|12782
"Just constantly repeating '""I am sorry, daddy, I am so sorry.'"""|12782
""""|12782
'My parents are going to be pissed'[BK][BK]They where.|12782
"'Well, that did not work.'"""""|12782
"'shit, what do I do now?'"""|12782
"[BK][BK]got up and drank what must have been a litre of water"""|12782
I slipped off the stool, panicked, found my footing again, was very relieved.|12782
I was very lucky once I slipped off the stool.|12782
One afternoon I thought I surpassed my limit .|12782
My plan was to hang myself in my uni accommodation using a belt .I set it up and was stood on a chair ready to kick it out from underneath but I did not .|12782
I stood there with this belt tight around my neck as memories flooded my mind , I was stood there for nearly half hour just thinking completely ignoring the belt around my neck , I realised it was not what I wanted and I could fix it .|12782
As I was undoing the belt I slipped and the chair nearly went over but I somehow managed to get the belt loose enough for me to get my head and collapsed on to the chair safe.|12782
I left uni after that , never told my friends or family because they did not need to know .|12782
Well I originally thought I was going to drink myself to death with anything, and I did that but it did not work.|12782
So, randomly, I picked up reading more and was starting to get hooked on books.|12782
This is probably what saved me form trying again.|12782
"'Did anyone see that?'"""|12782
[BK][BK]* As my rifle jammed at a shooting line up when i was pointing at my head.|12782
[BK][BK]I looked to my left: *guy looking forward at target*[BK][BK]I looked to the right: *guy looking forward at target*[BK][BK]Me: Lift my foot up to signal my gun jammed, Lieutenant arrives to fix my gun and stands behind me for the rest of the shooting.|12782
[BK]- I just could not imagine getting caught trying to shoot myself but my gun jamming.|12782
THANK FUCKING GOD i did not get caught attempting suicide.|12782
Later that day talked to the Commander and told him I want out.|12782
"I am alive and well now. """|12782
Took all of my brothers prescribed sleeping pills and put on some music.|12782
Woke up in the hospital to him yelling at me about having to gt a new prescription.|12782
The one most memorable time that I had attempted suicide, I had put the end of a shotgun barrel in my mouth after cocking the slide, pulled the trigger and *click*... Heart was racing so bad that I damn near died of a heart attack... A few hours later, after calming down, I checked the shotgun, cocked the slide again and a shell came out...|12782
Turns out, the shell was a repacked/reload and it failed to fire... My first thought after that was 'Holy shit...|12782
"I literally just fucking failed at something that was SO simple...'"" I then proceded to cry for a few hours."|12782
Got a phone call from a friends mom that I had not seen in years (the friend and his mom were very near and dear to my heart) and she asked me to pass it down the line that he had shot himself and ended his life and he had left in his suicide note that I was to be contacted...|12782
I literally had no words...[BK]I feel so fucking horrible that he and I attempted suicide on the same night at about the same time and I am the one who came out of it unscathed... Not sure if I should feel bad for him or for myself...|12782
"Still to this day, at times I feel as though I should be dead and he should still be alive... he had 2 kids and he was a wonderful father where as I myself had/still have no kids and I am a waste of space... :("""|12782
My first attempt, I took some pills.|12782
I did not bother to see what kind they were.|12782
I just grabbed them and downed them.|12782
I was in shock over something I had done.|12782
It was more of a I cannot believe I did that, I should be punished moment than a clear cut I want to die moment.|12782
I had meant to slap my ex.|12782
Our daughter was right beside him.|12782
I pulled my hand back to slap him.|12782
I was really pissed off.|12782
In rage, my hand turned into a fist.|12782
He moved our daughter to the area the fist was aiming for.|12782
I almost hit her instead.|12782
I stopped myself just in time.|12782
[BK][BK]He said he was going to call the cops and report me for abuse.|12782
I was freaking out and took the pills.|12782
I guess I really did not want to die.|12782
A couple minutes later, I told him what I had done.|12782
He took our daughter to our neighbors and drove me to the hospital.|12782
After my stomach was pumped, my first thoughts were I never want to do this again.|12782
I felt that way though because I hated the pump.|12782
Not a pleasant experience.|12782
That scared me enough to never do it again.|12782
Once I was thinking more clearly, I realized I did not want to die because I did not want my daughter to live with the knowledge her mother killed herself.|12782
"'I am such a fucking idiot'""[BK][BK]I jumped in front of a car, but I was too scared to really do it properly."|12782
I went early, and the car slowed down enough that I was not seriously hurt.|12782
I got up straight away and ran, just felt like such an idiot and was really glad I was okay only because the guy in the car did not deserve to suffer the consequences of my actions.|12782
Then I just really hated myself because I knew I was too afraid to every take my own life, that I was going to have to keep living because i was scared.|12782
Then how unfair everything was, that I was feeling this while the people that caused it where living happily.|12782
[BK][BK]So I pretty much decided to live to spite the people that caused me so much pain.|12782
Had a lot of anger at the time and I manage to use it to keep me going.|12782
When I got home my mum got a bit of a shock, I was pretty good at playing pretend until that night.|12782
My mum realized what a bad state I was in and took me to get help.|12782
"Probably not the best way to go about it but it worked and I have gotten a lot better since."""|12782
That time when I was 8 years old trying to slit my throat because I had enough of everyone bullying me and parents arguing and fighting everyday.|12782
Since that day I learnt to not give a fuck about anything since I know nobody does so about me.|12782
:/ Eh life goes on, still no idea whether I regret that I did not kill my self.|12782
'OH MY GOD!|12782
Weenie and piglet almost got hit by the truck!|12782
I need to save them!|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Seriously, I have not watch much about weenie the pooh or read much, but that is the first and only hallucination I had after overdosing my dad''s high blood pressure pills at 16."|12782
[BK][BK]Comparing to others, I feel like I attempted for the most ridiculous reason, which was I am so insecure about my parents'' feelings to me, or I was so NEEDY.|12782
They were decent parents, just busy with work constantly.|12782
(both programmers...) I have only been to a park and a zoo with them during my childhood, and every summer in elementary school, I got sent to my babu''s place, and they rarely called since they were busy with work.|12782
[BK][BK] They provide me with everything except for emotional communications.|12782
They are not incapable of showing affection, because during family get-togethers, they always play and care for my cousins, and would even gift them novelties that I never had.|12782
(Well... mostly just small stuff like Japanese candies/chocolates they bought as souvenirs when they were on business trips, and I was spoiled so much that I took my parents'' money, that had been spent on xboxes, play stations, psps, overseas vacations or other things I wanted, for granted, but still...|12782
I failed to realise that and got so jealous about their affection towards my cousins.)|12782
And I was constantly trying to get their praise and approval, so stressed out that I would had depression from junior high to half way through high school.|12782
[BK][BK]Struggling to get out of bed to save piglet (frankly weenie died in my hallucination), I vomited uncontrollably on the ground, and my mom heard and rushed to my room, and called off work to took care of me the whole night and the following three months since the overdoes had some side effects on me...had a fever for about a week, and then pneumonia, which I guess it is caused by the fever, and then my left ear started to act up.. cannot hear things at times, so went to see the doctor and ended up having a paracentesis tympani.|12782
[BK][BK]But I was glad besides the hospital visits for physical health problems, my parents did not miss to recognize my mental illness, and acted in time to book a really good psychiatrist for our family, and we did counseling for about a year, talking through a lot of things, solving the problems in our family.|12782
"[BK]"""|12782
"*'I am so cold'""*[BK][BK]I had either passed out or fallen asleep in the bathtub after bleeding and bleeding, and when I woke up I was freezing cold, dizzy/woozy as all heck, with my cut arm floating above the water and a scab starting to form."|12782
I did not have enough energy to try to cut again, but I was so cold all I could think was that I did not want to be cold anymore.|12782
Took me almost an hour to get out of the tub, clean myself up, and crawl into the hotel bed.|12782
I felt light-headed for almost two weeks.|12782
[BK][BK]I am doing a bit better since then, probably thanks to finally going on Zoloft, but when I look back at the whole mess, all I can remember is that before passing out I was not afraid.|12782
I felt so ready to die, at peace about it.|12782
Until I woke up, I had effectively killed myself and been okay with it.|12782
"Then I was just cold."""|12782
"My first thought was 'well as I am still alive I would better ring in work to tell them I am too sick to come in'"""""|12782
I thought of my little sister walking in my room to see me hanging by the window life-less.|12782
So sad....|12782
I felt bad for even trying.|12782
It was really weird because while in the process of trying, I had pseudo convinced myself I was not trying.|12782
Like, I was telling my brain I was just taking all these pills to see what happened.|12782
When I actually woke up from getting a bit fucked up, I was just really scared.|12782
Like, fuck, had I actually just tried to die?|12782
I never thought that I was doing that badly.|12782
'Please do not take me to the hospital.|12782
I will have a mental health record.|12782
"I will never be able to get a job.'"""""|12782
'No one knows this even happened.|12782
"Nor likely will.'"""""|12782
I started laughing.|12782
The rope I had tried to use was way too weak.|12782
My dad had always said I was no good at tying knots.|12782
I guess he was right.|12782
I sat down and looked at my shoes for about 15 minutes.|12782
[BK][BK]It was so surreal, building the last God only knows how many months of depression into one conscionable action that would decide my fate, and to fail that action created quite a cognitive dissonance in my life.|12782
It was not the end of my depression and it was not the end of my suicidal thoughts but it was a significant roadblock to them taking over my life[BK][BK]I had rope burn around my neck for a few days and I had hit my shoulder when I had fallen so immediately after I had put the rope and stool away, cleaned up what little there was to, I sat down at my table and just kinda stated into space, not really thinking of anything but thinking of everything simultaneously.|12782
[BK][BK]It was weird and I will never forget the exhilaration of actually being alive after that.|12782
I have felt depression, and thought suicidal thoughts since but that memory, the rope burn, the stool and the weird way the sun had shone on the wall in my kitchen after I had tried came back to me and each time I tried a different way to fight it.|12782
[BK]If I have learned one thing since its that you can fight it, but it is hard.|12782
I nearly lost but you can fight it.|12782
You just have to try.|12782
Well, I do not know if what I did counts, but I did a 4 day binge on amphetamines.|12782
I took 16 30mg vyvanse, snorted 3 adderall 30mg, and took 2 adderall xr 30mg.|12782
My chest started hurting about day 2 and I did not give a shit.|12782
So I definitely understood what was the probable end of this.|12782
On day 4 about 30 minutes after pill 16 I stood up and my heart hurt extremely bad, my head felt this weird pressure, especially under my teeth, and everything went blank.|12782
When I sat back down I looked at my friend and it took me about 10 seconds to realize who he was, where I was, and what I was doing.|12782
I spent the next few hours feeling my blood desperately try to reach my head and feeling like i was passing out every now and again.|12782
I balled my eyes out and I never cry.|12782
Everything I valued that I did not realize I did, like the love of my parents, quickly became obvious.|12782
I wrote them a death letter telling them how much I should have appreciated them because I was sure my heart was stopping soon, Or that the blood wouldnt stay in my head long enough.|12782
After this same feeling continued for two days I just texted my dad, which seemed like the worst case scenario at the time, I just wished that I was dead so that I did not have to face my parents for some reason, 'can you come pick me up, I need you.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]When they got there I got in the car, balled my eyes out and tried to get it out that I thought my heart was failing."|12782
I cannot describe what this did to me mentally.|12782
To not be alone in what I thought was my death, it was like years of having severe anxiety and depression melted away.|12782
Maybe like an ego death or something.|12782
Tons of abstract insecurities just washed clean.|12782
It was wonderful.|12782
Then about a week in bed passed, no doctor could explain why I feel the way I do even after ecgs and ultra sounds, and the old feeling crept back in when I started feeling like I should be doing something buy I could not.|12782
[BK][BK]I wish I had a happy ending but I am just about the same as before i did this and it is been 6 months.|12782
I still value that experience though.|12782
"I know that there is something now that is seperating me from that state of normalcy. """|12782
'Fuck.|12782
What do I do now then?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I would thrown up the pills."|12782
Never went to hospital and no doctors ever believed me when I told them later, threw up enough of them to avoid much in the way of damage apparently.|12782
Missed the day of uni.|12782
"Never got help."""|12782
'Fuck.|12782
It''s summer.|12782
Everyone will see the scars.|12782
"'""[BK][BK](not like I wear a sweatshirt 90% of the time anyway.)"""|12782
Let me start off with saying this.|12782
I am in a much better spot, with a loving fiancée, decent job while going to med school for my dream career.|12782
Life could not be better.|12782
Having said that, quite a few years back I cut my throat.|12782
I woke up in the hospital with crying parents, wishing I was not there.|12782
I was in pain, angry I was still alive, and now having to deal with my parents.|12782
What's worse was the therapy that followed in the next few weeks.|12782
It did not do a damned thing.|12782
However, much later there was a little moment of clarity.|12782
Nothing I was actually angry at, or upset about, was permanent.|12782
I could literally just leave, or change.|12782
And I did.|12782
It was hard, having to cut people out of my life.|12782
Some I considered friends, and some were family.|12782
But it was worth it.|12782
I changed my look, I changed as much as I possibly could.|12782
A year later I met the woman I am soon to marry, and im glad I failed.|12782
My first thought after my failed attempt was FUCK I'M ABOUT TO BE COMMITTED!|12782
I was forcibly committed for 3 months.|12782
NOT what I had planned on.|12782
Still haunts me to this day.|12782
Well in my particular situation, I was going through what was the roughest patch of my life (so far), I had had enough of it and was going to hang myself in my bedroom.|12782
I had the rope all tied off, a chair set up, everything.|12782
I got into the chair, put the rope around my throat, pulled it tight.. Then my younger brother walked in.|12782
[BK]He started crying his eyes out, pleading for me to get down, yelling at me in confusion, asking why, what was the matter, etc, etc.|12782
[BK][BK]It was then I realized, what would the damage be to my siblings, my parents, other family, friends.|12782
It would kill them (figuratively), if not send my brother or sister down the same path, and I could not let that happen.|12782
[BK]I then changed my life, my thoughts towards things, my actions, everything.|12782
I moved away from home and found my 'happy place', and now I could not be happier, then a pig in shit.|12782
I vaguely remember going from being in resuscitation with cables all over me, to being wheeled to an emergency ward and slipping in and out of consciousness after that.|12782
[BK][BK]I hated myself for being alive.|12782
I hated myself for hurting my mom and my boyfriend.|12782
I hated my boyfriend for making me feel so disgusting.|12782
I hated myself for being so disgusting.|12782
I wanted to cry but I was so out of it, i just could not - I also had such a dry mouth from the tablets I took, I really wanted a drink but just could not fathom how to ask or how to obtain a drink myself.|12782
regain consciousness[BK][BK]'Am I still alive?|12782
Fuck I cannot fucking even do this right.|12782
Did I piss myself?|12782
Oh no... there is no possible way I can hide that rope burn.|12782
"I better try this again...'"""""|12782
In my case, I was sitting down to a French essay, and my head would not shut up.|12782
I took 21 painkillers of various kinds and sat there waiting for the pain to go, and then I heard my family''s voices from downstairs.|12782
"After that, I realised what I would actually done in the mother of all 'Oh SHIT'"" moments"""|12782
First thoughts, fuck - now I am in more pain and nothing has been resolved.|12782
[BK][BK]Over the next few days, was difficult.|12782
Some people lashed out at me, some apologized, some distanced their selves from me.|12782
[BK][BK]Over the next few years, never been so happy I failed something.|12782
[BK][BK]I am a completely different person now, there is a reason why so many people urge others not to do it.|12782
[BK][BK]I think the vast majority of people will be surprised by how many people have attempted, and how those people often do not fit stereotypes.|12782
[BK][BK]Please if you are reading this and contemplating any actions - send me a PM - I am always here to talk.|12782
I will give a little into my recent history.|12782
My girlfriend and I that have been dating for 4 years, got into a big fight last year.|12782
She started giving me less and less respect and more and more attitude until I flipped.|12782
I told her that she was treating me like shit and told her that we were done.|12782
[BK][BK]Yup, Facebook status to single (sounds cheesy but that is how news is official these days).|12782
A few days later I get a call from her.|12782
I was going to block her number permanently but for whatever reason I answered.|12782
She was in the hospital from attempting suicide with sleeping pils, pain pills, alchol, anything from her family's medicine cabinet.|12782
She wanted me to come see her.|12782
[BK][BK]I never planned on seeing her again but my hearts true feelings came out and I got to her as soon as I could.|12782
I stayed with her the whole time and never left her side.|12782
Move forward about a few months and we are back together and everything is good.|12782
[BK][BK]She talks about why she tried to commit suicide.|12782
She said I was the most secure and stable thing in her life and without me she did not want to be here (alive) anymore.|12782
I find a letter in the mail from her doctor saying that she has a miscarriage due to the suicide attempt.|12782
[BK][BK]To this day I have the date written on a picture of her in my wallet.|12782
The date is written small across my GF stomach.|12782
I look at it and just think where my life would be right now with a wife and kids.|12782
[BK][BK]I plan on marrying her and to have a child together.|12782
I dream of the day I finally get to meet our baby.|12782
I have struggled with suicide countless times.|12782
I truly have lost counts of my thoughts, plans and attempts.|12782
I have battled mental health issues and mental illness that has always led me to suicidal conclusions.|12782
[BK][BK]I feel like I cannot escape the feelings, like they are a shadow watching my every move and that one day they will win, that my fate is inescapable.|12782
[BK][BK]You know what helps me?|12782
There is a young man who paces up and down my street, every day, several times a day, in rain or snow or sun or day or night.|12782
He is always pacing slowly, smoking a cigarette or drinking a soda or just contemplating.|12782
Whether I have a good day or a bad day, he will pace.|12782
He is the one constant thing in my otherwise turbulent, unpredictable life.|12782
He keeps me grounded on shitty and wonderful days.|12782
He will never know how much I appreciate and care for him.|12782
He saves my life every single day that he walks.|12782
My thoughts during consisted of making myself throw up the pills and praying I didnt die.|12782
When I finally went under and woke up, my first thought was how glad I was that I didnt die.|12782
I tried three times when I was younger.|12782
After getting bullied and my dad leaving, I felt terrible.|12782
I felt useless and thought(somewhat still think) all of those insults they used to say about me were true.|12782
[BK][BK]I felt worthless and tried to OD.|12782
[BK]I took one pill after another but slowly enough.|12782
"When I reached the 'dangerous'"" level I just broke out."|12782
[BK]I am someone that does not cry anymore, since all of this shit happened to me, 6 years ago, I am totally unable to cry.|12782
My therapists never accepted the fight I might be depressed until recently.|12782
All that time I felt like I was just a terrible mistake, and, since you hear about depressed people breaking down, and my therapist not telling me anything; I felt like I was just faking it all and I was not even sure of all my feelings.|12782
[BK][BK]So I broke down, sobbing one or two tears, the best I could do.|12782
I was, and still am, too scared of finishing it off.|12782
I was,what, a few pills away from it but I just could not.|12782
"[BK][BK]I do not know if its really '""surviving suicide'"" but I felt a need to share it here."|12782
"What I said happened 3 times in the past years but I never managed to go further."""|12782
I have got two attempts and one almost attempt to my name.|12782
First attempt was trying to swallow pills and just pray I never wake up, I cannot remember what pills they were but I was 17 and stupid so probably nothing that could kill me.|12782
Woke up with vomit in my bed and nobody to notice it at home.|12782
First thought was 'where the fuck am I?'|12782
Since well I thought i was never waking up.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]Sending attempt was 2 weeks later.|12782
Tried hanging myself in the backyard.|12782
Turns out not being a boyscout paid off, the knot at the loop came undone and all I could think was 'I cannot even fucking kill myself properly' [BK][BK]Almost attempt came 3 months later while in counseling and under near 24 hour surveillance from my family or any authority figures cause my parents had seen the cuts on my arms.|12782
[BK][BK] Something minor had set me off, probably something girl related (my girlfriend at the time was also severely depressed, loved her to death, and we helped each other at times but overall we were just straight bad for one another) [BK][BK]So I decided that it was not worth everything, I decided to sneak out and hang myself in the middle of the night (I had a fixation with this way as the summer prior my best friend hung himself, and I was not smart enough for the right pills)  [BK][BK]The thing that changed my mind was remembering that friends mom at his funeral service.|12782
I could not bear to think of my mom in the same way, or my friends who were already still living with his death having to go on with mine too.|12782
[BK][BK]I think the only reason those thoughts even occurred is because I went to get help (even if it was non optional) so please please please if you are in a dark place get some help.|12782
When just taking to the therapist helps.|12782
They're not emotionally invested so you can actually have a chance for a rational conversation about what is going on.|12782
"'Dying does not hurt nearly as bad as coming back does.'"""""|12782
I did not understand what was happening.|12782
"Once I realized that I was alive and that I had failed, my first real thought was simply: 'Dammit.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]That was one of three attempts, all of them being very similar.|12782
"It''s not an easy thing to go through but like to think I am better for having been through it and experiencing those feelings."""|12782
Probably buried but first time i tried to kill myself was drinking a liter of vodka and downing a bottle full of xanax.|12782
Went to the hospital after being more depressed than normal and not being able to sleep for 2 weeks, started getting facial ticks and hallucinations, etc.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway the first time my roommates at the time had no idea what was going on.|12782
They told me that apparently I cried like crazy and was muttering to myself and banging my head.|12782
I went to sleep somehow face down  and woke up with vomit all over everything.|12782
"First thing i remember was 'fuck why am i still here'"" few seconds later '""wtf did i just do'""...[BK][BK]Second time I was home after graduating still no job or anything, just wasting space."|12782
As a side note I am diagnosed with major depression and general anxiety disorder.|12782
My ex who cheated on me like 30+ times in our 1.5 year relationship called me after we broke up for like 1 day so far, just to let me know she fucked someone else.|12782
I was not stable emotionally and so I went to the liquor store, drank another liter of vodka and downed another bottle full of xanax.|12782
[BK][BK]I really wanted to die.|12782
I passed out on the street, neighbors drove me to the hospital.|12782
"Woke up and thought '""fuck im a piece of shit i cannot even die correctly, why are not i dead, fuck you god, seriously fuck you, my whole life I have prayed that i would just die and you cannot give me that, fuck god, fuck god'""."|12782
Saw my parents there waiting, felt horrible about it.|12782
Sister told me my dad cried (he never cries, he is a tough ass motherfucker).|12782
They left after I said i needed some time, I started to cry about how alone I am, and I have no friends.|12782
"[BK][BK]Realized that when I tried to talk to my so called '""friends'"" for help, no one gave a shit about me."|12782
I actually only have 1 real friend who tried to visit me and see if I was okay, he is forever my blood brother even if he lives far.|12782
And I am closer to my family.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway ended up in mental hospital, out patient treatment, multiple psychologists and therapists and the whole shebang.|12782
[BK][BK]Still feel like killing myself but will not do it until my parents pass away.|12782
I am a 28 year old loser who is pretty much a shut in and doing shit jobs just to pass time.|12782
[BK]For those wondering I have a bachelor''s in biology, I wanted to be a doctor, did worse and worse each semester as things got worse, still graduated.|12782
I havne''t turned my life around.|12782
I am thinking about trying to go back to school for computer science or something..[BK][BK]Anyway sorry for the long ass story/rant.|12782
Haven''t talked to anyone about this shit for like years now.|12782
"[BK]"""|12782
When I was in grade 7-8 I was in the basement with friends... And when you are little with people around you do dumb things.|12782
"I attached a jumping rope from the ceiling and said 'I wonder how it feels to be hung'""... That spilt second that I got off the chair was scary as shit...  it was not a real attempt but if I ever think of doing it for whatever reason in the future I already know how scary it is... so I would not have the balls to."""|12782
Back in 84'' i nearly choked on the u-cord until my dad came and cut me loose.|12782
"He said, 'the pain you felt today, it will never go away and the best way out is always through.'"""""|12782
So pissed this random BITCHH is kissing me on my mouth|12782
1st attempt I just remember wishing I had jumped out the window and that nothing would change[BK][BK]2nd attempt, Incoherent crying followed by the feeling I would wake up my parents if I cried louder.|12782
[BK][BK]3rd attempt.|12782
I just remember feeling passed that I could not do it and I had to run.|12782
So I drove 300 miles and got rid of my phone and bought a new one.|12782
I realized I was wrong about 16 hours later, then I was glad for my wife to be holding me.|12782
Then we changed the highway we were on.|12782
And I knew I was being taken to the hospital I had been only once before and I could not imagine going back I was hurt.|12782
I planned on running out the door.|12782
I did not do any of that, I was in the ER for over 12 hours before admitted.|12782
My wife was only there for the first and last hour.|12782
I struggled with bitterness and telling truth and wanting to return the favor of bringing me to the hospital.|12782
Dec 2013.|12782
Was super depressed about the loss of my grandmother and loss of my big brother.|12782
One in 2009, that latter 2012.Took a BUNCH of Xanax.|12782
Didn''t feel life was worth living.|12782
Lost girlfriend, lost job, Mother was recently put in nursing home.|12782
Never had a Father.|12782
Got shot faced drunk.|12782
Took the pills.|12782
Started watching YouTube videos.|12782
Black out.|12782
Remember laying on the couch, fading in and out.|12782
"Remember calling my mother, 'I fucked up, send an ambulance to my apartment.'"""|12782
flashes of a cop in my house.|12782
Flashes of be in the back of an ambulance.|12782
Flashes of being at the hospital with friends around.|12782
Come too as I am being taking from the hospital to the psych ward at the hospital a couple towns over.|12782
Spend a week there talking to psychs.|12782
Get a prescription for anti-depressants.|12782
Move into a homeless shelter/halfway house because I have no where else to live.Get off meds because I do not feel like they have any effect.|12782
Live with friends on and off.|12782
In and out of jail on and off.|12782
That''s where I am at now.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit:  am currently drunk.|12782
Recognize my problem with alcohol is the root of all my problems.|12782
"Can''t stop though."""|12782
'Sonnuva bitch, I am still alive?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]For me it was a large amount of pills."|12782
Over the period of roughly three months I had been prescribed four different medications for back pain, and after enough mornings in pain and misery and watching as the marriage I had just gotten into crumble around me, I decided to end it.|12782
Two of the prescriptions I was allergic to, and all told I had somewhere near eighty pills to swallow, so I set out to end it in a numb mess.|12782
[BK][BK]I went down to a vending machine, slapped in enough money to get about eight Monsters, and just sat around the corner of the building trading back and forth between chugging Monster and throwing back pills.|12782
Once both were polished off, I walked over to a trash can, disposed of the empty bottles and cans, and went to light up a cigarette.|12782
All told it was maybe two minutes that it took me to slam the medication down, so I figured one last smoke was reasonable.|12782
A friend saw me, asked if I was alright, and I just looked at him and smiled.|12782
"'""I am fantastic, I just committed suicide.'"""|12782
I finished the cigarette, snuffed it out, stood up, and blacked out on my way to the floor.|12782
[BK][BK]Since then things have gotten better.|12782
It took a lot more trauma, a touch of booze, and a lot of nights spent crying over my past opportunities , but in time I came to realize that it was possible to be fine again.|12782
"I am sad it took so long to be okay, but I suppose that is the essence of the thing."""|12782
That my mum was not there.|12782
[BK][BK]I grew up in an abusive home and attempted suicide as a teenager.|12782
I meant it.|12782
I really wanted to die.|12782
I never lost consciousness, but arriving at the hospital was kind of a blur.|12782
There were some traumatic aspects to how I was treated, both physically and mentally.|12782
(I made a complaint some years later, there was an investigation and I received a full apology.|12782
Suffice to say they treated me like crap.)|12782
[BK][BK]I thought my mum would come to the hospital, hold my hand, be there for me somehow, but she did not.|12782
Realising I was all alone and nobody gave a flying fuck about me was the worst moment of my life.|12782
(And no, I am not wrong.|12782
She did not give a fuck.|12782
This is the woman who a) ignored the fact I was being abused by my father and b) used to ignore me or look through me if I was upset.|12782
)[BK][BK]I just wanted someone, anyone, to hold my hand and say: I am so sorry you feel so sad.|12782
And nobody did.|12782
I was just alone, with nurses talking to me like I was nothing because, they said, they had other patients who did not choose to put themselves in the hospital.|12782
[BK][BK]Life is better now.|12782
I am happily married.|12782
I am a therapist.|12782
But I am not sure I will ever fully get over the lack of compassion I experienced that day.|12782
I am dreaming about life, space, meaning of it all, and stars.|12782
I hear the rythmic beeping of the machine and it interrupts my ponding.|12782
Oh shit, I realize that this is not my soul floating around in space, I am actually here.|12782
[BK][BK]So I wake up.|12782
'Fuck.|12782
Now I have to do this all over again.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I have been to a hospital before and knew I would have to be processed all over again."|12782
Waking up was never the problem.|12782
Life has not been the same since before the attempt, though.|12782
It''s very different, more flat.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: reading these people''s posts and comments, my heart goes out to you all.|12782
I might have ad an experience but everyone is unique.|12782
"I hope you all are okay."""|12782
Sometimes I feel like I have always been trying to kill myself.|12782
My choices, and vices, and relationships.|12782
Some days, it seems like all of them have been ways that I punish myself for not having succeeded.|12782
[BK][BK]I wont talk about attempts.|12782
But, failing has always felt bizarre to me.|12782
For a long time, I kind of thought that the me that tried, died.|12782
This me was somehow another me.|12782
Same problems, same insufferable internal dialogue, same crooked face.|12782
I always thought that I *had* succeeded, but was not given peace, because I deserve the suffering.|12782
I do not know why.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not try anymore.|12782
[BK][BK]I think I am doing better now.|12782
I do not have the fathomless pits, and the rocket ship highs anymore.|12782
I miss them sometimes though, I feel like I was a more interesting person when I could afford to feel more.|12782
"[BK][BK]My advice, if I had any, would be 'do not bother'""."|12782
Not only do the people you leave have to mourn you, but it does not end.|12782
It wont.|12782
"[BK][BK]"""|12782
After trying to kill myself I woke up in the psych ward.|12782
And that is not a fun place to be.|12782
I remember I was scared shitless and was not allowed to leave for like 6 hours.|12782
I could not sleep but I had a bed.|12782
"'Now everyone is going to know.'"""""|12782
'Fuck.|12782
Fuck.|12782
Fuck.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Then my mom knocked on my door to see if I was up and getting ready."|12782
I was still fucked up feeling.|12782
[BK][BK]I decided to tell my mom what happened, rather than try to make it through school.|12782
I knew I would likely have an emergency meeting with my therapist.|12782
I did not expect to be sent to a hospital.|12782
"Had to be there by 10pm (it was 3 hours away, and they were nice enough to allow me to pack and prepare, and let my parents drive me).[BK][BK]'""Fuck."|12782
Fuck.|12782
"Fuck,'"" was a frequent thought that whole day."|12782
My parents took their time driving me.|12782
We stopped for fast food for lunch.|12782
We stopped at random scenic areas.|12782
They took me to dinner at a decent chain restaurant.|12782
I know that they were just trying to have more time with me.|12782
"But, '""Fuck."|12782
Fuck.|12782
"Fuck,'"" stayed in my mind."|12782
"[BK][BK]I am so glad that I survived."""|12782
It was probably berating myself for being selfish, irresponsible and horrible.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not consider this an actual suicide attempt because I backed down and did not jerk the wheel but I think it is a little different than most stories maybe so I might as well share.|12782
Just to be clear I do not mean to compare this situation to some of the ones in this thread as it is no where near severe.|12782
I apologize if anyone feels like it was not a proper attempt so it should not be posted.|12782
[BK][BK]I was driving home from class one day during the majority portion of my life in which I was clinically depressed due to a number of factors (though primarily trauma and unfortunate life circumstances).|12782
It was night and the road was empty and I was feeling a little bit of a spiral come on.|12782
I started to cry and eventually just shut my eyes and pressed my foot down completely on the pedal.|12782
My little car started picking up speed and struggling but I heard it rev harder than I had ever before.|12782
My hands were shaking and I was desperately trying to build up the strength to jerk the wheel.|12782
[BK][BK]I came to my senses after what felt like an eternity but I imagine was not more than a minute because I had not drifted off the road yet, only into the opposite lane from where I started (it was a wide highway).|12782
I do not remember how fast I was going at the peak of it because I slammed my brake and started slowing down in a panic before I looked at the speedometer.|12782
But I had time to put my brake on and open my eyes to look and in that time it still had not dropped below the high 80s in a car with quite good brakes.|12782
[BK][BK]My first thought was how terrible of a person I am and how I really SHOULD just do it if that is how reckless and inconsiderate of others I am, to endanger them like that.|12782
My second thought was that I need to tell someone.|12782
Unfortunately, I was in the middle of nowhere and was too nervous as an 18 year old girl to pull over in the middle of the night and stop for a long time.|12782
So I kept driving even though I was shaking so hard I could not keep the car straight and had to focus really hard to not swerve side to side.|12782
[BK][BK]I did not drive for a long time after that, and I still get nervous sometimes when I come home from class at night.|12782
Midterm, have to go get my A.|12782
[BK][BK]Life just went on.|12782
Everything planned for me continued, and I still had a part in it.|12782
[BK][BK]Wish it was more profound.|12782
Fuck me, cant even do that right.|12782
"'Guess I should get dressed for school.'"""""|12782
I have got to call my mom.|12782
[BK][BK]Her voice was shaking as I explained it to her and I will regret the pain and fear I put her through for the rest of my life.|12782
This is the one thing I wish I could take back.|12782
'Oh my god my little sister.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I am/was going through a really rough patch and one day I just could not take it anymore."|12782
I grabbed all the pills I could find and downed them.|12782
It got really hazing and I just remember passing out in my bed.|12782
Next thing I know my little sister was trying to FaceTime me cause no one could get ahold of me.|12782
I took her call and just lied to her saying I was not feeling well and had just been sleeping.|12782
"She just said  '""Brother I love you'"" before we hung up."|12782
[BK]I never felt like more crap because I realized at that moment I would have left my baby sister with no answers and only questions as to why I would do that.|12782
I felt ashamed because I know how much she loves me and it would have been a dick move to do that to her.|12782
"[BK]I still '""pray'"" that I may just go quietly into the night and that way at least a natural death would not have any guilt associated with it."|12782
I love my family but my little sister and I are close and just knowing I would hurt her just tears me up inside.|12782
"[BK]I still have horrible thoughts and just try to push through them but sometimes it just becomes so taxing that I wish I would not wake up. """|12782
"'The grass is really green.'"""|12782
[BK]  [BK]After I overdosed, I spent three days in the hospital that I cannot remember but the first thought I had after when I truly realized that I was still alive was that the grass we were driving by was somehow brighter.|12782
I did not want to talk to anyone about what I did.|12782
I did not even want to think about what my family witnessed.|12782
All I wanted was to see the world and actually take it in.|12782
I would ignored so much, closed myself off to life, and everything went dull and grey.|12782
"That last failed attempt was the one that left me looking to the world to be real once again."""|12782
I cant even do this right...|12782
Woke up, all weary in a Juvenile mental institute.|12782
I finally admitted defeat to my incompetence and inability to act normal in public.|12782
But I still havent admitted defeat to the fact that my ex was with someone better than me in all aspects.|12782
The first time I was just in a haze for a while.|12782
I had been interrupted during my attempt and resisted cops/EMTs for a while.|12782
After getting some stitches I spent a couple weeks in an inpatient clinic while they monitored me.|12782
I basically just slept the first two or three days.|12782
Anyways, I suppose I accepted that I was not going to succeed after I heard one of the EMTs tell a cop that they could stop the bleeding after I passed out.|12782
All I could think of at that point was how silly I was being.|12782
[BK][BK]The second time I tried to choke myself with 550 cord.|12782
I blacked out, but came to with a massive bloody nose.|12782
I was in full survival mode trying to get the cord off.|12782
I was really surprised at how desperately I was fighting to live.|12782
[BK][BK]I have not had any serious suicidal thoughts since, but I still do flirt with the idea.|12782
at how stupid i was for the way i fucked up because it was so very close, also started to regret it immediately, i was so overwhelmed that i could not control the tears - the minute i fell back from the railing was when a couple people from my class came out of nowhere and saw me, and then the rumours began.|12782
for a few days i was just disappointed in myself, it was a terrible horrible feeling and i had that feeling for a few years.|12782
[BK][BK]It's been 7 years and I am glad I am still here.|12782
'Oh.|12782
"Okay.'"""|12782
Nothing much.|12782
At that point, I was so devoid of feeling I did not really care.|12782
It was just another day.|12782
"[BK][BK]I took 825 mg of Doxylamine with a bottle of vodka (wikipedia says '""the lethal dose is 50–500 mg/kg'""), and dozed off in the living room chair."|12782
My brother had skipped school and come home early, and was pissed I was in said chair, so he woke me up.|12782
If he had not, maybe I would be dead, who knows.|12782
But he did, so I ended up calling my parents, who freaked out.|12782
And then I hallucinated in sepia tone for a while at the hospital.|12782
"Fun times."""|12782
I tried when I was 10, then again at 11.|12782
"When I woke up I was confused and my first thought was: 'my poor mom, I hope she knows this was not her fault'""[BK][BK]I then spent years trying to convince her that I am sane enough to want to live, and that it is not her fault."|12782
"[BK][BK]I asked my friend when I got out: '""there is no God, there is no heaven or hell..why then, do you continue?"|12782
Knowing we are all walking dirt, how do you not just kill yourself?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]He said he has faith, not in God, but in humans."|12782
We keep surviving things, and he wants to be around to help others if we are faced with a catastrophic emergency.|12782
Since then I have adopted his faith, and even found God.|12782
[BK][BK]I understand this is reddit and is strongly atheist, and I get why...but I have a reason to not kill myself now, and that is a very fragile thing.|12782
I will joke along with people, I am not an uppity spiritual person, but fundamentally without faith in humanity and my relationship with God I feel like going back to those dark places..|12782
I have not been to a church service but a few times a year I sit on the steps of a church nearby and have a couple drinks and just talk shit out.|12782
"It''s very theraputic."""|12782
When I was 15, I tried to strangle myself with my football belt.|12782
"It was the type of belt with the two metal 'D'"" shapes at the end that you loop through and pull tight."|12782
I had placed it around my neck and pulled as tight as I could.|12782
I started feeling like my face was turning to stone (it is the best way I can describe the sensation).|12782
[BK][BK]The next thing I know I hear my stepmother calling me from the top of the stairs.|12782
My room was in the basement, so my parents would just open the door and yell down when dinner was ready.|12782
I was completely embarrassed.|12782
I now had a huge mark around my neck.|12782
The belt must have loosened just enough for me to regain blood flow and start breathing again.|12782
I threw on a turtleneck and went upstairs.|12782
"Never to speak of it again."""|12782
I had just been told by someone close to me that I was a failure at everything in life, so while I was throwing up antifreeze the only thing I could think of was how disappointed I was in myself.|12782
[BK]I could not even succeed in noping out of life.|12782
[BK]There was not any relief, there was no anger, there was just deep, profound disappointment that I would never get out of this.|12782
I just had a realization that nothing was going to be the same.|12782
[BK][BK]My wife was the one that discovered me.|12782
She called my mom.|12782
I was given a choice between going to a psych hospital voluntarily or by police escort, police escort is an automatic visit to Green Oaks in Dallas...fuck that place.|12782
I chose to go voluntarily.|12782
Went to a private hospital.|12782
It was still the worst week and few days of my entire life.|12782
[BK][BK]I was given a diagnosis of BP 1[BK][BK]I did not sleep the entire time...even on Ambien.|12782
I had an awful reaction the first night to meds they gave me; not sure if it was the Trazadone or the Abilify.|12782
[BK][BK]I was switched to Ambien and Depakote after that.|12782
[BK][BK]They took away my anxiety meds.|12782
My normally excellent blood pressure of 110/65 shot up to a regular reading of 140/90 for the duration of my stay.|12782
They put me on this shitty stuff called Vistaril; it is essentially a giant dose of Benadryl.|12782
Did nothing for my anxiety.|12782
[BK][BK]I guess I should mention that they took my anxiety meds because I would swallowed a bunch of them and slashed my arms--so I guess that is on me.|12782
[BK][BK]Ummm, my roommates (I went through two) snored insanely loud.|12782
Part of the reason I did not sleep, though given my anxiety level I doubt I would have slept even in a solo room.|12782
Plus I am used to a box fan and you are not getting a box fan in a psych ward.|12782
[BK][BK]They also had someone coming through to check on me every few hours...I do not know why....but it was inconvenient to say the least.|12782
[BK][BK]I spent the week trolling the nurses station, trying to talk my way out of that place.|12782
Told my psych that I was okay.|12782
That I did not need to be there.|12782
I did not go to most of my classes or meetings or whatever you want to call them.|12782
In short I was a pain in the ass.|12782
They called my family and told them I was being extremely uncooperative and manipulative.|12782
Took a long time after being discharged before I even became med compliant.|12782
I am surprised my wife put up with me.|12782
[BK][BK]Saw a lot of crazy (no pun intended) shit while I was in there.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway, that is an abbreviated version of my suicide attempt and the repercussions.|12782
It's been a long road (6 years) since my diagnosis.|12782
I have been in and out of day programs and almost committed multiple times.|12782
I have been med resistant and fallen in and out of self harm patterns.|12782
I am going through a major bout of rapid cycling as I type this and am due for a meeting with my psych and a med adjustment in a few days.|12782
[BK][BK]This mental illness shit is a tough road to plough.|12782
Every day is a fight.|12782
But I will not give up.|12782
[BK][BK]Sorry for the ramble.|12782
I conciously chose to think nothing.|12782
I woke up on my floor surrounded by empty sleeping pill packs, bloody paper towels, and a empty bag of green onion SunChips, mostly spilled, my chosen last meal.|12782
Suprisingly, I did not throw up or anything.|12782
My friend was banging on my bedroom door.|12782
He had no idea, he thought I was just being lazy, and he wanted to go swimming at a local waterfall.|12782
I cleared my mind to help hide from the reality of what I would done.|12782
I felt like I was watching a black and white movie of the day, like I was actually dead and I was seeing what I missed out on.|12782
I was really disappointed when I eventually figured out I was still alive.|12782
This is the 3rd time I have even brought it up.|12782
I regret not dying.|12782
I still think about trying again sometimes.|12782
I will try a different brand of pills.|12782
Or maybe I will just shoot myself and save the guesswork.|12782
"'I am so fucking useless I cannot kill myself'""."|12782
"[BK][BK]Yes, after years I realise this is terrible."""|12782
I woke up looking at the finger painting I had made while writing my suicide note, and all I could think about was how hard it was to see and how badly I needed to throw up.|12782
I stumbled out of my room to the toilet and hurled all of the pills that I had taken a few hours earlier.|12782
My vision was so blurry and I was so bent out of shape, it is a wonder I could move at all, much less down the hall to the bathroom.|12782
I felt a hell of a lot better after puking, so I crawled back to my room and passed out.|12782
[BK][BK]The next thing I knew, I could hear that god-damned mockingbird who lived in the tree outside my window.|12782
Daylight was shining through the French blinds onto my face as I lay in bed.|12782
I had an insane migraine headache and my ears were ringing like I had been to the most epic metal concert of my life.|12782
I remember feeling so defeated, like the cliché guy who fucks up anything and everything, even his own suicide.|12782
At the same time, I felt a bit glad about my lack of success, so I got up and attempted to carry on with my life like normal.|12782
Surprise, though, I ended up spending the next week and a half hallucinating, hearing voices, and talking to people in my kitchen who were not even there.|12782
I even thought there was some kind of rodent living inside my couch.|12782
I could see him and feel him running around underneath the leather, when in fact, there was absolutely nothing there.|12782
The after-effect of the overdose was really fucking weird and creepy.|12782
Never tried suicide again after that.|12782
'You could not even do that right.|12782
"Fuck, that was stupid.'"""|12782
""""|12782
I took a paracetamol overdose when I was 17 and drank a little vodka with it (I did not have a lot).|12782
[BK][BK]I actually went and did a short shift at a supermarket but ended up leaving early and going to bed.|12782
I woke up as normal thinking nothing had happened and was getting ready for work and my Mum somehow got it out of me that something was up.|12782
I confessed to what I would done and said I felt fine so I was expecting to just carry on the day as normal.|12782
[BK][BK]IF YOU TAKE AN OVERDOSE AND WAKE UP FEELING 'FINE' - YOU'RE NOT.|12782
GO TO THE HOSPITAL.|12782
[BK][BK]Paracetamol in particular will take a long time to kill you and it is a painful death as your organs shut down.|12782
[BK][BK]It was to late for me to have my stomach pumped so I spent 2 days in hospital on a drop.|12782
I was 17 and had to be on a childrens ward, it was horrible.|12782
I have tried a few times.|12782
Different each time but usually a general shame that I could not even do that right.|12782
Shit.|12782
The cops are here.|12782
I walked out of the woods with a very bloody arm, and the headlights of four cars in front of me.|12782
Oh fuck, I am alive.|12782
Wait.|12782
That's a good thing.|12782
I somehow immediately got better than I was before the attempt.|12782
2/10 would not overdose on alprazolame again|12782
I am surprised there is not a lot of feelgood bullshit going on in here.|12782
"Shit like 'it is never worth it'"" or worthless platitudes like '""killing yourself is never the right option'""."|12782
[BK][BK]There''s a lot of good answers here, so I do not think I would be able to add anything of worth to OP''s question, but I guess I will say that those who have have not suffered through suicidal depression have no clue what it is like.|12782
No point of reference that could possibly compare.|12782
Like trying to comprehend what a billion of something truly means.|12782
I will tell you, I came out through the other side after years of agony, but no matter how good my life gets, no matter what happens to me, it will never be worth it.|12782
[BK][BK]It was torture.|12782
A torture I could not escape, and I thought would go on until I died.|12782
A torture where I did not even have the sanctity of my own mind to protect me.|12782
My brain was the torturer.|12782
In the end, most people have that, they at least have their mind as the one last place of refuge.|12782
I did not even have that.|12782
[BK][BK]No amount of good that comes into my life, no amount of joy will ever be worth what I went through.|12782
If I was pulled back in time, and I knew I had to go through it again, I would kill myself in a heartbeat.|12782
"As of right now, I am content, satisfied, with just not being in agony every waking moment. """|12782
Cool, I am in an ambulance (whilst still psychotic) later at hospital it was more like holy fucking balls remove me from this torture chamber I am a functioning human (even though I was not)|12782
"Passed out while they were pumping in charcoal, pretty sure first thought when I woke was either 'Fuck that was stupid'"" or '""I am about to puke.'"""|12782
which I did.|12782
"Overdose is not the peaceful drifting off I expected at 17 or 18 years old."""|12782
"'Shit, it happened again.'"""|12782
Then this weird simultaneous feeling of being thankful that I am calm and feeling incredible self loathing that I cannot control my own brain.|12782
[BK][BK]Mostly this relates to a long standing battle with self harm with a few half-hearted suicide attempts sprinkled in there.|12782
"I always snapped out of it before I went through with anything more serious or planned. """|12782
I tried hanging myself last year at about this time.|12782
Needless to say it did not work.|12782
I tried using real rope and everything too, but the branch I was using had some serious rot on the inside, despite looking sturdy.|12782
"My first thoughts were something along the lines of 'Fuck me'"" cause I was just starting to black out when I hot the ground, wich broke my arm."|12782
"Other than that, I got some rope-burn on my neck, but I was fine."""|12782
Posting for my friend, who does not have a Reddit account and is sitting next to me.|12782

"[BK][BK]"""|12782
Tried OD-ing on Soma and Perco.|12782
I took the high expecting to go to sleep and not wake up.|12782
When i awoke the next morning my first thought was: well shit that was a waste of pain meds that I need and fuck I am late for school, since i woke up at like 5pm, and i had class at 6.|12782
This just happened one week ago actually.|12782
I knew I was not going to succeed when my brother walked down stairs to find me laying on the ground bleeding from the neck with a knife in my hand.|12782
I still kind of regret not succeeding.|12782
About two weeks ago I tried to end myself with rubbing alcohol, and needless to say it was not at all fun.|12782
[BK][BK]Pretty much seconds after I started chugging it out of the bottle my throat swelled up and I couldnt breathe at all for a good few seconds, and at that moment I realized I seriously fucked up.|12782
[BK][BK]All of this happened outside my house really late at night, and the alcohol part of it kicked in nigh instantly because it was only ten minutes later that I was wandering my small town without enough clothes on for the weather hoping I would freeze to death or pass out and not wake up, but it never ended up happening, and because of my regret I managed to get on the phone with a friend, and I ended up throwing the bottle of rubbing alcohol as far from myself as possible and going back home.|12782
[BK][BK]I ended up not even waking my parents while sneaking back into the house, and even got a nights rest, but I was still suffering in the morning, and I would ended up getting a friend to cally parents because I could not face them myself in the state I was in, they got me to a hospital and I was watched over and then released the same day, because I would only managed to get down maybe 100ml of the 500ml bottle, and ended up metabolizing it.|12782
[BK][BK]The following days were mostly spent nursing a hangover filled with regret and some self beating on for what I would done, but I came out of it realizing it was an impulse act fuelled by my mild depression and suicidal thoughts, as I would found the rubbing alcohol not even three hours before I attempted suicide with it.|12782
[BK][BK]Currently I am still sort of nursing myself back to mental health and I am signed up for an intensive outpatient program, which is essentially a daily group therapy on week days, and so far I have already rebounded back to what I would call decently stable (still probably mildly depressed though)|12782
When I tried to hang myself junior year of HS I thought that would be the solution to all my issues.|12782
That all the pain and shit I have felt and thought about would be gone.|12782
The memories of my parents fighting and me hiding, the times I was bullied, the times I just felt terrible about myself.|12782
I thought they would all be gone.|12782
Then when I tried to do it it is weird I just could not bring myself to do it, and thinking back on it 8 years later, I really cannot come up with a reason why.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not remember my first conscious thought.|12782
[BK][BK]I sorta blacked the memory out, but a feeling is still there.|12782
The feeling that I do not want any other person to feel that way about themselves.|12782
That life is that hopeless.|12782
So, while it was a battle and still is a battle this very day, I focused my life on a career of entertainment, specifically comedy, because I want to tell stories that make people laugh and also understand mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety.|12782
I guess what drove me not to do it ultimately is the idea that if I can make people laugh and smile for one moment it is worth going through all shitty parts of my life.|12782
I remember waking up, feeling awake, but I do not really remember seeing anything.|12782
I am not sure I was conscious enough yet, all I remember is realizing how warm my chest felt before I put my cold fingers to my favorite T shirt to feel the blood.|12782
It made my shirt feel like wet velvet.|12782
I had just fallen 12 feet and the blood from my head had ran down most of my body, pooling around me in a ravine that I thought was deeper than it was before I jumped.|12782
"My first thought was 'Fuck, what is this shit?'""."|12782
Once I realized it was blood I was pissed about my shirt being ruined.|12782
Then I started to feel how cold I was and began to freak out.|12782
"[BK]"""|12782
"'Fuck, I cannot move my legs'""  [BK]  [BK]I woke up after taking a handful of Tylenol and Klonopin."|12782
I had been taking a higher than recommended dose of Tylenol to weaken my kidneys for a few weeks prior to that, but one day everything got too much and I just took a handful of pills and slowly started to lose consciousness thinking everything was finally over.|12782
I am a bigger guy, so I guess I did not take enough because I woke up I do not know how much longer later and I recognized it did not work, then when I tried to get up, I could not move my legs...|12782
I tried to massage them to get blood flowing but I was sitting for about an hour without even feeling them.|12782
I had to text me roommate, who was also my best friend since grade school, that I needed his help.|12782
I did not tell him what happened, but he wanted me to go to the on-campus health center.|12782
I told him I was fine, and he still half-carried me there.|12782
[BK]  [BK]Ended up going to therapy a few weeks later.|12782
It helped.|12782
He still does not know what I tried to do.|12782
"[BK]  [BK]Throwaway for obvious reasons. """|12782
I was honestly mad.|12782
Mad that I was in the hospital with tubes down my throat, mad at the nurses for how they were speaking to me and treating me, mad that my mom was there crying and questioning me, mad that I had survived.|12782
[BK]It took some time to get over the anger, but once that subsided I figured that I now had a second chance so I would attempt to make what things I could control better in my life.|12782
[BK]It was not easy, and although I have a beautiful family, a stable job, finances under control, and do not abuse drugs I still get a random bought of depression.|12782
I had to realize that there is situational depression and non-situational, how to differentiate between the two and how to help it.|12782
When I attempted suicide I had lost my grandfather, my step dad was abusive, my boyfriend molested me and raped me once, and I was dealing with teenage hormones on top of it all.|12782
Instead of focusing on the grief of loosing a loved one I tried to self medicate with drugs (both prescribed by my therapist and street).|12782
That of course did not help and I intentionally overdosed.|12782
Feeling depressed during times of trauma is okay.|12782
It's normal.|12782
It's healthy.|12782
It should not be numbed..it needs to be felt in all its entirety.|12782
[BK]  [BK]Now when there is no outside reason to be depressed and you suddenly get sad for no reason, then you must focus on any and all the positives in your life.|12782
Retrain your mind to not dwell on things out of your control or things in the past that can no longer be resolved.|12782
Learn how to redirect your thoughts into something productive.|12782
I turned to my creative side and wrote, drew, sang, danced, anything to release the energy and feel better about myself.|12782
I still battle with it.|12782
Life is not easy, but then again life would be boring if it were so I take it day to day.|12782

2 shots of heroine, 4 Xanax, 4 OxyContins.|12782
That's how I found her laying on the floor at 9am in her little apartment.|12782
She had cancer and was a heroine addict for 30yrs.|12782
I have thought of ending my life before, but the thought of leaving that as my mark on earth and hurting people I know, it is not worth it!|12782
I would rather photoshopbattles, roastme, play video games and make dank ass memes.|12782
I am praying for anyone suffering of depression or drugs, you are not alone and I love you!|12782
*Hugs, tears were dropped during the making of this comment!|12782
I luckily failed 7 years ago.|12782
Disappointment and more sadness.|12782
Then sensational euphoria.|12782
Almost like an explosion of sensory information.|12782
Came to in an ambulance.|12782
I was unconscious  hanging with a rope around my neck for 7 minutes, my mom walked in early from work and found me.|12782
She called 911, got recesitated 3 minutes later since an ambulance was down the street for an epileptic man.|12782
Disappointment was the biggest feeling and then what I can describe as an adrenaline rush almost.|12782
Like the blood just came back to my brain in a wave.|12782
I am still fighting depression to this day even with drugs and therapy.|12782
I cannot say I am happy, more so that I do not want to leave my family destroyed and sad now, something I understand better now.|12782
If I did not have family or friends, I would be gone.|12782
If anythings worth suffering for, it is so my family and friends  stay strong.|12782

Followed rapidly by a resignation that cut me so deeply to the core, it was just total resolution that I would continue getting kicked in the teeth (by life) until I worked up the balls to try again.|12782
[BK][BK]I would run a hose from the exhaust of my car into the cab/ seating area, and idled the car until I fell asleep.|12782
I was parked in a lot near this beatiful park I would grown up next to at like 3 AM.|12782
My mom was concerned about me, sent a neighbor to look for me, and they just happened to see my vehicle while driving around the neighborhood.|12782
[BK][BK]The worst part is having everyone around you know, and be ultra sensitive and weird, like you have not already gone over the edge and anything they say will tip you that way.|12782
Plus,  the nurses get all angry at you at the hospital.|12782

"' I need to refine my technique'"""""|12782
I was real scared.|12782
I did not want to go on living, I really did not.|12782
The depression makes me feel that way, like I am worth  nothing, and at times I will believe it.|12782
I get urges all the time to jump out a car or keep on drinking until I meet my maker, but when I woke up I was scared that I had gone through with it.|12782
I cried and cried and held a knife, just shaking and trying to work up the courage to slit my throat like a beautiful smile.|12782
But I thought to myself there was no way in hell I will let myself lose to the thoughts, so I called a friend and got help.|12782
[BK][BK]What people do not realize often about depression is that it works differently in different people.|12782
It scares the shit out if me.|12782
My depression does not make me sad, it makes me angry for no reason, and I mean anger like I caught someone fucking my own mother after drugging her after a turn with my sister's.|12782
The urges make me want to slam people into the counter at work for asking me what size coffee we have, or kicking a puppy for licking me too much.|12782
I fight my depression by making myself sad, listening to music I know will trigger me and thinking about the day I found out my son's mother cut her own throat the way I was about to my own (two years later I found out, it broke me).|12782
Point of my ramble is that I am glad I got help, I am glad I have the strength to not stab my co-workers and to not hurt that puppy, I am glad I have people that care about me, even if the devil on my shoulder tries his hardest to convince me no one cares.|12782
[BK][BK]My advice to anyone going through what I do every damn day is to keep on going as best you can.|12782
I know it is hard, im in tears writing this out.|12782
I know sometimes you wake up and you cannot move because what is the point of getting up again, who gives a shit if you live or die, right?|12782
Well I am saying people do care, but you have to care yourself.|12782
Find your courage in what you can, armor yourself with whatever pleasant thoughts you can, and reach out.|12782
Someone, somewhere will grab your hand and pull you to the safety of what you need, be it pills or hospitalization or just a friendly soul to vent to.|12782
Fight on, my friends.|12782
Fight your devil's with kindness so that one day, someone will save you from yourself.|12782
[BK][BK]Damn, that felt good to get out.|12782
If you guys have any questions or if you need a shoulder to cry on, ol' stitch is here for you.|12782
Good luck, and stay strong|12782

That or it is because it is 5am.|12782
[BK][BK]Born in 92, growing up was really bad.|12782
I was like, 4 or 5 or something and both parents would beat me daily.|12782
Separately too.|12782
Half of it was me doing something.|12782
Other half is legit still a mystery to me.|12782
Dad left when I was 9, so it made it just mom to keep beating my ass til i was like 12-14, i dont even remember when it stopped.|12782
Slippers, belts, sometimes the buckle of the belt.|12782
Kneeling on salt, arms sideways up.|12782
Proper lashing.|12782
Facing the altar, forced to ask the Lord for forgiveness.|12782
I do not know if that is where I get my faith or I just have it in me.|12782
All that time as a kid, planning to end it, but selfishly finding ways for it not to hurt.|12782
Tried slitting the wrists.|12782
Ended up a coward that could not go beyond outer skin level.|12782
Brother was a big torture.|12782
Everything he did, I get blamed.|12782
Had severe anxiety and fear throughout the whole thing and even had some moments after my mother calmed down (after 12-14).|12782
She started to calm down when she took a strike with the belt buckle and I just grabbed the buckle mid air and stared at her.|12782
Happy I did not end it because when I was 14-15, I met my group.|12782
My squad.|12782
The Men.|12782
These guys got me over whatever the fuck was bothering me at home and just got me out of there without even intending to.|12782
We just go to internet cafes and played games after school every single day.|12782
Affected my grades, did not give 2 shits, I would get beath either way, but I did not because I did not realise that is when my mother calmed herself.|12782
Graduated high school with these guys with the last year the best year of my life.|12782
Met the love of my life because of them.|12782
She was their childhood friend, a batchmate of ours in school, different section because we were in this school that had sections segregating boys and girls.|12782
Somehow convinced her I was boyfriend material after high scool, around 2010 and still together to this day.|12782
I did not think I would get emotional typing this.|12782
I thought this was behind me.|12782
I ended up moving to London around 2013, long distance relationship with the girlfriend.|12782
Brother and other families in Switzerland, mother still in The Philippines, where I was, now that I mention it, I never said that yet.|12782
My aunt from Switzerland gives me support when I need it, I work McD and it is depressing lately too.|12782
"Hoping to attend college here this year since it will be my 3rd year after residing in the United Kingdom, so I dont have to pay no 'overseas fee'"" and I can get support from my brother and/or my aunt."|12782
It''s still a little overwhelming at times that I am alone here in London, but not as bad as the first few months.|12782
Currently love my mother and my brother, despite all of that happened to me.|12782
I was mostly a coward in my suicide attempts, but almost happened and that scares me today.|12782
I still appreciate what my friends did for me despite them barely knowing a thing about my situation at the time.|12782
I still chat with them, have voice calls on the internet while we play separate games or occasionally play together.|12782
Somehow getting this off my chest was good.|12782
Kinda hurts for some reason.|12782
But it does give me will to move forward.|12782
I did a lot of things and been through a lot as well.|12782
I guess this is as much as I can share.|12782
Luckily none of my circle and nor my girlfriend go to Reddit aside from how-to stuff.|12782
"xD """|12782
"I think it was somewhere along the lines of 'Fuck, if this is death, it feels too freaking similar to life.'"""|12782
And then came the pain and the sight of what I did.|12782
It was not a brilliant idea really, not that I am happy now or any less depressed, but I can keep on living.|12782
"At times I just get stupid ideas and spur of the moment actions that bring me close to death. """|12782
A few years back when trying to cope with the dreadful reality of being lonely and the feelings of uselessness on a christmas morning, I tied a belt on my neck to my pull up bar.|12782
Because of my 6ft tall height and the bar being too low, I had to lean really hard to get myself to choke.|12782
after about 30 seconds, I said to myself ' What the fuck am I doing?|12782
"This is taking awfully a long time'""."|12782
I still struggle on a daily basic to try not to kill myself, I hate being alone because then it will entails suicidal thoughts.|12782

Coming out of a coma is pretty awful.|12782
Waking in the hospital, I was only a sliver of myself.|12782
My thoughts did not concern depression, guilt, or relief at surviving.|12782
All of this was beyond me.|12782
What were they then?|12782
[BK][BK]Pieces of hallucinations and remnants of near-death.|12782
The texture of turf, and a children's plastic table illuminated by stage lighting.|12782
The smells of incense, the feel of jet lag, and the taste of my wedding cake.|12782
A mute man slicing pineapple and how difficult it is to stay above the water.|12782
Lots and lots of nothingness.|12782
Confusion as if you were an adult looking through a child's brain or a rock gaining awareness.|12782
[BK][BK]It took several days to even faintly understand why I was in the hospital, and more than a week before I realized the person who sat beside the bed was making sure I did not try again.|12782

"I was panicking thinking, '""Who the fuck are you!?"|12782

I did not know how long he had been there and I felt like a burden so I told the doctors to tell him he could leave.|12782
[BK][BK]I had to go to mandatory rehab for a little over a week.|12782
It was decided there that I was to stay with my mother for a time after.|12782
When I was picking up some things from my apartment I saw my neighbor.|12782
It was weird, we did not say much, we said a few personal things and I thanked him.|12782
[BK][BK]Before we ever talked about the details of that night he overdosed on heroin.|12782
Alone.|12782
In his apartment.|12782
[BK][BK]I have a lot of guilt being as he was there when I was going to overdose alone in my apartment.|12782

My dad tried to kill himself several times before succeeding when he was 33 (I had just turned 11).|12782
There was some evidence when he died that he would changed his mind in the last few seconds.|12782
At the viewing, people commented on the scrapes on his nose from falling on his face, presumably trying to reach the telephone he would knocked off a table nearby.|12782
[BK][BK]I have been suicidal maybe twice, depressed since he died (I will be 40 next month).|12782
"I do not remember 'before'"" well, but my mom said recently that my personality changed pretty significantly."|12782
Reading these comments is comforting somehow.|12782
Not sure what else to say.|12782
"But thanks."""|12782
I felt enormous relief.|12782
It was not because I realized I had lived though the night, but because I was not throwing up anymore (in retrospect I do not think I did actually throw up, but for some reason I remembered doing it at the time), my stomach was not churning as bad, and my room was not a mess.|12782
For some reason that relieved me too.|12782
I was afraid of making someone clean up after me.|12782
For the rest of the week though, mundane activities left me out of breath for long enough to retch, and I still retch to this day any time Im winded.|12782
I also feel sick when I can smell strong odors from cleaning supplies.|12782
[BK][BK]During the week, my roommate kept telling me to see my therapist and go to the hospital.|12782
When I finally got out of the hospital, my friend got me fish and told me he was counting on me to take care of them and they were a hassle, but it really kept my head clear a lot of the times, and I never wanted to kill myself and leave them behind.|12782
I tried to overdose on sleeping pills and nearly succeeded.|12782
At the last minute of my consciousness I pictured my father hearing that I was dead and was immediately filled with regret and guilt.|12782
I called my best friend who could not be bothered to drive 5 minutes to come help me get to the hospital.|12782
My ex-girlfriend (was his present girlfriend) rushed to my house and dragged me into her car and sped off to the hospital.|12782
I kept trying to fight the feeling of shutting down but I could not resist it and lost consciousness before we reached the hospital.|12782

They brought me in a blanket.|12782

[BK][BK]Turns out, as I discovered much later in life, that the overdoses I took likely were not lethal because of a genetic condition I have which affects how I metabolise some painkillers.|12782
I woke up with abdominal pain each time, but it faded.|12782
[BK][BK]After the first two times, I considered other methods.|12782
The benefit of wrist slashing was that I found out, for me, self-harm is a protective mechanism - it shocks me out of the fugue state I get into when I am suicidal.|12782
That helped me survive a good few years.|12782
[BK][BK]I was genuinely trying to die, but my core reasoning - that it was to protect the people I loved who would be sad for a while but overall the balance would mean their lives would be infinitely better without me - meant that consideration of who would find me and how traumatic that would be was a primary concern.|12782
[BK][BK]I am convinced that this accounts for a major part of the discrepancy between men and women''s suicidal behaviour - women try more, men complete more.|12782
Women are socialised to be continually aware of the people around us and how our existence affects them.|12782
The much more certainly lethal methods are also the most traumatic for others.|12782
Scenarios I dismissed: hanging, because people do not look just peacefully asleep after that; cliff-jumping, because of the possibility of washing up on a shore or landing on rocks and having children find me; train/bus, because including someone else in the trauma would be cruel.|12782
[BK][BK]I just wanted to be gone, and for the people I loved to be able to pick up the pieces and move on rather than deal with a lifetime of my catastrophic impact.|12782
Waking up to find I had failed at dying reinforced many of my beliefs about myself and how useless I was.|12782

"Too smart to fit in, I thought."""|12782
August of last year me and my ex had just split i had been forced into an abortion at the time and it killed me i could not handle life anymore i had been on so many different anti depressants and was so broken i decided i do not care anymore went and brought packets of panadol nurofen and had my anti depressants.|12782
Took quite alot i was through three packets one panado one nurofen and one antidepressants (zoloft).|12782
In my dazed motion i accidently sent a snap chat to a friend saying goodbye.|12782
I had driven down to the beach and hidden my car little did i know i left my.phone tracker on.|12782
Ah the joys of hospital trips amd your stomach being pumped.|12782
[BK][BK]I can now say getting out of the toxic relationship being with my new partner and expecting twins  has made me the happiest I have  been in nearly six years.|12782
[BK][BK]Surviving a suicide attempt has left me .|12782
somewhat scarred  but it opened up my family to my pain and they really realized how broken i was.|12782
I woke up in a pool of regurgitated sleeping pills and was so groggy I just got up and took a shower like any normal day.|12782
"About halfway through the shower I remembered what I had tried to do the night before; the realization was a weird mix of 'wait a second, I am still alive'"" and that dreadful sink of emotion when you see an '""F'"" on a test you studied damn hard for."""|12782
I woke up in the hospital feeling something like a hangover.|12782
It was basically because my body was overtired since I had fought like an animal when they were forcing the coals down my throat.|12782
For those that do not know what that is it is standard procedure to put coals into the patients system if he is admitted to the ICU because of attemted suicide through pain medication, so he will vomit up anything inside his stomach.|12782
Apparently the coals also work like a sponge while they are inside you, sucking up whatever it is you ingested.|12782
But to get them inside you they have to force a tube down your neck and into your stomach.|12782
I do not remember much of what happened in while this was happening.|12782
But I had vague memories of me screaming my lungs out like I had experienced a nightmare.|12782
I also had rashes all over my body that formed because I over exerted myself while wrestling with the doctors.|12782
But the first thing that came to my mind when I regained full consciousness was shame.|12782
I was deeply ashamed of myself for having done something so stupid.|12782
The way my family looked at me was something I wont forget.|12782
I was 18 at the time and had never really dealt with my depression or told anyone about it so it came as a huge surprise to them.|12782
I felt alienated from them because of my actions.|12782
[BK][BK]I had to see a psychiatrist after the incident (understandably).|12782
That really helped me get a better perspective on how I had hurt my family and that what I had done was a deeply selfish act.|12782
I am not trying to shame people that try suicide or tell anyone that he is a bad person for thinking about it.|12782
But if you go through with what you are thinking about you are saying goodbye to everyone that loves you permanently.|12782
You are taking a fully self centered decision to end your life and to me it is probably the most selfish thing you can do.|12782
'I just accepted that I was going to die.|12782
"I have never had that before, holy shit I have to call Hannah.'"""|12782
Hannah being one of my best friends.|12782
This was about a year ago.|12782
[BK][BK]I had tried to hang myself in my room and things started to go black.|12782
"At the moment I was thinking, '""this is okay.'"""|12782
"And then immediately after, '""no this is not fucking okay!'"""|12782
And I had to pretty much do a pull up (thanks Physical Education.)|12782
Unfortunately my hands shake a lot now and I stopped talking to a lot of people.|12782
"Things kind of suck, but I think I will be okay for a while."""|12782
I woke up in hospital after jamming a knife into my wrist and going as far up the arm as I could.|12782
I was confused and sad, confused as to where I was, sad as to why it didnt work.|12782
annoyed they wouldnt let me leave out of fear of me doing it again, instead I was forced to keep living, keep doing this every-day.|12782
its mixed do i regret attempting... no i regret no succeeding.|12782
Call me a pussy call me a coward but I am tired.|12782
tired of trying to make things better.|12782
trying is hard work especially   when it does not get you anywhere.|12782
All things considered my thoughts when waking up were of just plain confusion.|12782
the content reminder on my wrists are embracing to say the least.|12782
maybe it was cowardly but I like to think I am not a bad person for trying, not every horror film ends with the demon being being slade i guess.|12782
[BK][BK]I am rambling.|12782
if you need cheering up after this depressing comment heres a joke.|12782
[BK][BK]What prize did the inventor off the knock-knock joke get?|12782
[BK]The nobel prize|12782
Fuck, I really need to learn how to tie knots.|12782
Please do not read this if you are diabetic and depressed.|12782
Hell, do not read this if you are a medical dependent with depression.|12782
It''s dark as hell.|12782
If you need someone to talk to, PM me or check the sticky''d mod post at the top.|12782
[BK][BK]Let me tell you about how my world used to work.|12782
Mind the rant, you cannot really turn this sort of thing into storytelling.|12782
[BK][BK]A type 1 diabetic in shit control is basically in a constant living state of a suicide attempt.|12782
You are constantly fighting to keep yourself alive while your body does everything possible to throw you into either a coma (extreme low BG levels) or into Diabetic ketoacidosys (extreme high BG levels).|12782
[BK][BK]If you take that struggle and add depression (which is statistically common in childhood onset type 1), you get a situation that can cause that living constant attempt.|12782
In fact, it is downright masochistic just how that edge is.|12782
[BK][BK]The weirdest part is that that sort of dangerous edge could be unintentional.|12782
Just not having good control can put you in that perilous medically neglectful spiral.|12782
"[BK][BK]Another issue is that lack of medication can directly cause depression and a host of other 'lethargic'"" style symptoms."|12782
Once your in the hole, it is horribly hard to climb out.|12782
Even the effort to go and get your Meds from a cabinet could be enough to wind you and force you to need a rest.|12782
[BK][BK]Even stranger, the well accepted remedy is to have a specialized doc (endocrinologist) basically yell at you.|12782
They cannot actually help you if you cannot keep up the treatments.|12782
That means that the chronic illness that allows that situation can only be improved by reducing the depression.|12782
It''s a catch-22.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]I am in better shape now but there are still moments that I have to work incredibly hard to keep my self stable.|12782
It''s a challenge but it allows me to appreciate every moment to it is fullest and it gives me a hell of a sense of humor.|12782
"[BK]"""|12782
Fuck.|12782
And the subsequent 5 times: Fuck.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]I am too tired at 28 with non treatable MDD, GAD and whatever diagnosis they would like to toss at me to be thrilled.|12782
I have done my dreams, besides my Phd - but that is okay.|12782
[BK][BK]Very little family - well, actually just Dad (my Sister and I are estranged) -and I feel after so many years(12 or so on and off) should be allowed to say 'I would like to go'.|12782
[BK][BK]It seems irrationally cruel to not let those who remain in agony, cannot work, and have such an intensity of fatigue that it strains their whole physicality to force them to keep on keeping on.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]We need more evidence in so far as the brain.|12782
Right now - we are bunk.|12782
"'I am a fucking idiot'""."|12782
I remember being super depressed, I tied a shoe lace to my closet hanger where you hang your clothes and I made a loop and put it around my neck and I just dropped nearly broke the thing and I decided to get up.|12782
I told myself I am a fucking idiot, I am too fat, this will not hold.|12782
I gave up and later told myself that I cannot take the bitch way out.|12782
I still get depressed but I use music to calm me down and occasionally self medicate with cannabis.|12782
I used to get so depressed I wanted to kill someone else, that day I guess I decided I should kill myself.|12782
"Glad I did not ever really go through with it."""|12782
waking up feeling confused because there was an oxygen mask on my face.|12782
"the next feeling was 'oh, why does my bum feel wet?'"""|12782
and realising that I would just shit my pants, then trying to get up and run for the toilet because there was more coming.|12782
I ended up sitting on the toilet, shitting my brains out because the doctor decided to give me a laxative the night before, and puking thick, black activated charcoal and pills all over myself and on the floor whilst crying in absolute misery and disgust at myself.|12782
"[BK][BK]the nurse that came when I pressed the buzzer was very kind and nice and she got me a basin to vomit in to, stripped me naked and wiped me down with a damp towel to clean me up a bit until I could have a proper shower."""|12782
I could have played a game of league or something in that time|12782
Part of me does not want to post but part of me thinks it might help some.|12782
Throaway because almost nobody knows this.|12782
Even my closet friends who I consider family.|12782
[BK][BK]I have tried to kill myself twice, and I have come very close 2 other times.|12782
The coming close incidents I found myself feeling much worse than normal, which was still pretty badly.|12782
One of them I attempted to give myself alcohol posioning, and simply did not drink enough.|12782
The second, I almost ingested about 9000 mgs of amphrtamine pills at a friends wedding.|12782
I did not because I did not want to ruin their day.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway, the main time, I almost shot myself.|12782
My girlfriend at the time and our friend left the house to get everybody food, and I was left alone in the house with a loaded gun for about 40 minutes.|12782
"I realized immediately the situation and in my head I thought 'it is time, today''s the day'""."|12782
I held it and cried for a brief time and sat there with it to my head almost the whole time they are gone.|12782
I have seen multiple posts of people saying they thought of their parents, friends, and such...and honestly I did not.|12782
I just wanted the pain to stop.|12782
[BK][BK]As I was working up the nerve they came back and I put the gun down and acted like everything was fine.|12782
I did not do it that day because I bitched out.|12782
[BK][BK]I think of that often, though.|12782
The fact that I could have had I spent a little less time thinking.|12782
"However, life has improved as well so on an average day I am happy I did not. """|12782
I felt a massive feeling of failure and embarrassment.|12782
I was incredibly upset by the fact that it did not work.|12782
After overdosing on a little over a gram of ametriptyline, I was out for 20 hours in the hospital.|12782
I woke up and my mom was there asking what I did.|12782
I realized that there was no chance of me having another attempt while in my parents and doctors' care.|12782
[BK][BK]It's 3 years later now and a day does not go by where I do not want to die.|12782
I just cannot do it though when my family needs me so much.|12782
It's a very hard lifestyle for someone to live only for other people.|12782
"I tried to overdose on a cocktail of pills from my medicine cabinet when I was 16 and I woke up to my dad saying 'what, are you trying to kill yourself?'"""|12782
It was the worst thing I have ever gone through because I was so confused and high and my parents were crying and I never wanted to hurt them I just wanted to fall asleep and never wake up.|12782
I spent the next four days in the hospital and then another week in a psych ward and the second worse day of my life was the day I was picked up from the hospital because I could sense my parents disappointment and fear and I was forced to face the consequences of what I did, it was just a pretty shitty time in my life.|12782
"That was 3 years ago and honestly I am not doing a whole lot better now but I keep myself alive, more out of fear of going back to the hospital than actual will to live. """|12782
I tried to before but didnt have the guts to and honestly im happy about that life is truly beautiful(mainly the internet)|12782
I did not take enough pills..|12782
Well, this was not so much a intended suicide per-say, rather a bad event that I was going with.|12782
I was caught out in a rip-tide one day along with my sister, and as we were young, we could not swim very well.|12782
About that time, I was receiving the brunt of bullying in my school life.|12782
So I was thinking, 'At least people will not have to deal with this annoying, awkward kid.'|12782
So I kinda just stopped swimming, and began sinking.|12782
[BK][BK]About 30 or so seconds underwater (like I said, I was not actually intending to die rather than go along with it, so I was not really in a rush to drown), I started getting pulled by some random bloke who happened to see me and my sister (she was being helped by my dad, who had a really bad back from an incident in the army).|12782
I still was not really doing anything, rather then going along with it, so I literally was not moving anything, just being pulled.|12782
We eventually made it to shore, and taken to hospital.|12782
[BK][BK]I dunno if I was in shock or whatever, really still had not been feeling anything, so when we got back to where we were staying at the time, I kinda just sat around on the couch.|12782
My sister was a bit more upset about it.|12782
She cried about how she felt terrible about how she put me in danger, because the reason we were out there was because our younger brother and ourselves were playing a game.|12782
When she admitted that, that was the first thing I actually thought since.|12782
Knowing that my sister (who up until then I respected immensely but did not think cared for me, like everybody else) was worried for me rather then herself during the time...kinda just struck.|12782
[BK][BK]So now, I am out of school, entering university, and gotten over the bullies.|12782
Most of 'em were dickheads, and the majority of them actually had some issues of their own (some physical, some mental).|12782
I do not talk about that day anymore, and try to help others where I can.|12782
[BK][BK]-----[BK][BK]What I thought:[BK]Well now I feel like crud.|12782
Give her a hug, and tell her she is great and brave.|12782
I am late, but I guess I will say it anyway.|12782
I tried overdosing meds at 16: my parents were out of town and I was just looking for a way to do it that had the least chances to leave me paralyzed if it did not go as planned, so I went for my mother''s hypertension medication.|12782
I swallowed a box, some sleeping pills and vodka, and went to sleep.|12782
[BK][BK]I first woke up a few hours later because my dogs were barking, and realized I had pisssed my bed.|12782
"At that point I just thought 'it did not work yet'"", and downed another box of pills with vodka before going back to sleep."|12782
I did not allow myself to think much about it, I just wanted it to be over.|12782
[BK][BK]Then, in the morning, I woke up again.|12782
That''s when I realized I was not going to die though I felt tingly and weird.|12782
"The first thought I remember I had is '""shit, I need to call my mother and tell her now'""..."|12782
"The days that followed were the worst of my life"""|12782
I was confused and angry, for one.|12782
As someone who was constantly told they were not good enough, or could not match up to expectations, I found it ironic that I could not even kill myself properly.|12782
My parents did not help.|12782
"When I told them about it, the first thing they told me was 'You''re stupid, no intelligent person kills themself.'"""|12782
""""|12782
Cop here, late nineties I get a call of an aided case on the overnight shift.|12782
We entered an apartment and saw a young man with the cord for a set of vertical blinds still around his neck hugging his mother while they both violently wept.|12782
He still had the dust and plaster in his hair from where the cord pulled the drop ceiling from its tether and thwarted his attempt.|12782
[BK][BK]We stood in silence until they noticed us|12782
My first thought was the same as another user's comment.|12782
Why did they have to bring my parents into this?|12782
Couldn't I have just had my time alone in the mental hospital until discharge and then face them?|12782
It seemed like they were like hey lets force this kid who attempted suicide to do the next shameful thing....talk to your parents a about it when it could have been they were all or part of the reason.|12782
I am Asian so I felt at the time it was more shameful and embarrassing for me for them to have to see a son who attempted to kill himself.|12782
Being forced to talk to them at the mental hospital after was so gut wrenching.|12782
[BK][BK]So this is my first post ever on Reddit because suicide is a very important topic to me.|12782
I have been on Reddit for maybe 9 months and sometimes I will think about creating an account and posting but never get around to it but I wanted to elaborate for those who are interested.|12782
[BK][BK]So the first time I took 40 Benadryls and woke up deaf in one ear for the day.|12782
I did not tell anyone until way later on after the attempt that actually put me in the hospital.|12782
I was pretty freaked out but eventually my hearing came back.|12782
I do recall being very drowsy and trying to go to the restroom but I kept trying to open the door like the handle was at the bottom of the door.|12782
It was strange because I obviously knew where the door handle was but was so disoriented I was either hallucinating or just too messed up to get my body to rise fully.|12782
[BK][BK]Fast forward a few months or so later I took 90.|12782
I actually bought the 100 pill bottle but was taking 10 at a time in 5 minute intervals and only made it to 90.|12782
They said I puked up purple and started to seize.|12782
Apparently they forced coal down into my stomach to get me to regurgitate as much of the drugs as possible before it entered my system.|12782
Mind you this is a recount from my parents so I am not positive on all of the details.|12782
He told me the doctor said I flatlined and a defibrillator was used to bring my pulse back.|12782
Those who visited me said I was conscious for 3 days in the hospital but not mentally so.|12782
They said I kept crossing my eyes and seemed to just not be there.|12782
I do not actually remember any of it.|12782
My first conscious memory is walking with an IV into the mental hospital where I stayed for 10 days before being discharged.|12782
Luckily my parents did not approve the anti depressants because I did not want to take them either especially considering I was 16.|12782
I had heard that they cause more issues with mental stability prior to 18 but that was about 8-9 years ago.|12782
[BK][BK]|12782
'How am I alive?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]It''s hard to remember - I was in the hospital, in and out of consciousness for the first day, and for the next two days I slowly regained my cognitive abilities."|12782
But during my conscious moments I journaled to myself - the thoughts were coherent and complete, but the words were broken, with words starting late or ending early, as if I lost consciousness mid-sentence.|12782
[BK][BK]In those scribbles, my first thoughts were wondering what happened and how I would survived.|12782
The next thoughts were of terrible, paralyzing fear.|12782
[BK][BK]I attempted for a very specific reason - based on the information I had at the time, terrible events in my future were a certainty, and I made a rational decision that dying would be more merciful than living through them.|12782
Thankfully, my information was wrong, and I survived to learn as such.|12782
[BK][BK]To this day, however, none of us know how I survived.|12782
"By all rights, I should be dead."""|12782
Shit i better clean this up before somebody finds me|12782
Not really my first thought, but after awhile, I soon realized that when they say it gets better, they are likely lying.|12782
I believe my life will improve by the time I start going to college and move out, but it was supposed to get better 3+ years ago.|12782
Well my suicide attempt was a mixture of tablets at 3am in the morning 2 years ago.|12782
I took a mix of psychiatric medication as I had not long been discharged from the psych ward and every other tablet I could find in the girlfriends house.|12782
This included prescription strength painkillers, asprin and many more.|12782
I think in total the police counted 400+ tablets had been opened from previously closed boxes.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not remember even getting to the hospital, or even the emergency services being called but I was in intensive care for 7 days and i had to be resuscitated twice.|12782
Eventually when I came too, apparently I said to the doctors, why did you not let me go peacefully.|12782
[BK][BK]Nevertheless, I was filled with guilt as my parents come in to see me, tubes everywhere machines bleeping, heart monitor all over the place.|12782
[BK][BK]Several hours later I was taken to a ward for a week long review.|12782
Kidneys and liver were heavily hit during the OD but thanks to doctors I guess I am OK now.|12782
No permanent damage, except for some flashbacks.|12782
[BK][BK]Part of me wishes I was still successful and I do not regret what I did but I am now moving on in life with a lot of mental health support.|12782
[BK][BK]|12782
I had a rough breakup.|12782
Was sitting in my bathtub sobbing with a loaded .45 1911 in my mouth.|12782
Pulled the trigger but for some reason it did not fire, I ended up dropping the gun, texting my mom to come pick me up and to check me into a hospital.|12782
Ended up spending 5 days in the psych ward, crying at night as all the thoughts haunted me, how I would never hear my dad's laugh again, or feel the unconditional love that my mom exudes.|12782
Or holding my cat at night when I am having a terrible day.|12782
I am glad that the gun malfunctioned, and I am glad to still be here today even though I still have days where I wish things were different, and I am slowly changing them for the better.|12782
[BK][BK]The worst thing through out the experience was the countless times how I had to tell different doctors how I planned to kill myself.|12782
At the time I had 5 different ways, all of which involved not being found by my mother; parents are divorced so no chance my dad would find me as he lives in another state; and all the while seeing the hurt on my mom's face, that look of her baby hurting as bad as he was... that was utter gut wrenching and I feel horrible for putting her through all of that but I am glad she was there for me.|12782
The other hard part was when my dad would call me at the psych ward before the visitor hours were over just to talk to me for a little bit, I broke down in tears every single time just because I would hear his voice and feel safe, that maybe everything will ultimately work out in the long run.|12782
[BK][BK]That was 7 months ago today it still hurts to think about, but I rather people know that they are not alone, nothing is worth ending your life for, no matter how shitty of a situation you are in, it is not the end of the world, someone loves you out there unconditionally.|12782
There was no real coherent thought I broke down crying, pulled the magazine out of my rifle and cleared the double feed.|12782
Then broke the rifle down and started cleaning the bolt housing group and fell asleep with the pieces in my lap|12782
How am I going to pay for that ambulance ride?|12782
[BK]|12782
"'I cannot even die right and now the bed is a mess.'"""""|12782
"'Huh, was not expecting a Prado to be able to break like that'""[BK][BK]Seriously, if you are going to try pick another way than death by car."|12782
"It''s just a shitty way to do it."""|12782
Need to breathe|12782
'Fuck.|12782
Fuck.|12782
Fuck.|12782
Fuck.|12782
FUCK!|12782
"Why am I still fucking here? '"""""|12782
"'This is really, really going to hurt tomorrow'"""""|12782
First time I woke up blind and with a tube down my throat.|12782
"I think it was 'I am sorry'"" which I tried to cry through the tube at my dad who was the only person''s voice I could understand in the room."|12782
Everyone else sound like rotten buzzing and metal.|12782
[BK][BK]Second time I spent the better part of a week and a half in a full bodied hallucination of mostly hell- as well as cutting up the shit out of my arms and legs while fighting against the restraints they had me in.|12782
Permanently some motor function in one of my hands because of it as well as various other weird nerve damage because of the pills and amount I took.|12782
[BK][BK]I had to be resuscitated both times, multiple times.|12782
I really really wanted to die.|12782
I do not so much anymore, especially after finally being giving the right pills at the right dosage for psychotic depression.|12782
[BK][BK]If you are on the edge and considering and happen to be reading this as that internal cry for help, or self-flaggelation.|12782
Well.|12782
I cannot help you.|12782
I know when I was in your place nothing anyone said made sense, fit me, or sounded real/genuine.|12782
"I remember when I woke up in the first hospital, after a couple days I met a nurse that said '""so... you tried to kill yourself?'"""|12782
"and I was like '""um.. yeah'""."|12782
"She replied with, and in the most bland, boring, apathetic I-could-care-less attitude '""But you have so much to live for'""."|12782
I am pretty sure I broke up laughing.|12782
Just thinking about it now even seem fucking insane that she would say that to me, and like that.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway, if you are that very rare person who somehow is going through the exact thing I was going through- 1. its much worse to be suicidal and too afraid to do it because of what you experienced last time (literal, true hell, the hallucinations gave me a panic disorder and sparked off serious psychotic symptoms in my day-to-day life).|12782
"Essentially truly feeling like '""you have no options'""."|12782
and 2.|12782
God, the world, whatever you believe in that you think is ''judging'' you so harshly and wants you for dead.|12782
Think about how many people in the world there are, how many of them do not know about you and do not care about you, and then ask yourself why god or the great gaia spirit would be any different.|12782
Ask yourself why they would care about you begging for forgiveness.|12782
They do not.|12782
You''ve been asking forgiveness of yourself this whole time.|12782
Doesn''t matter how much you insist you are asking them, asking for absolution.|12782
You are asking your damn self.|12782
"Why then will not you just give it to yourself?"""|12782
when I first came to I was in a four point restraint to the hospital bed.|12782
"first thought was 'fuck that did not go as desired!'"""|12782
spent the next month in icu as I had done enough damage to my internal organs that even though I survived the initial attempt the doctors were not sure if my body would survive the aftermath of the attempt.|12782
[BK][BK]good or bad I type this response about 14 years after the attempt with no major attempt since.|12782
I have done some psychological testings in regards to the attempt (counselling group individual etc) ive been cleared medically meaning there is no cause to the effect of bi-polar and such.|12782
"the attempt was simply an emotional desire that I was tired and giving up."""|12782
Shit now people are going to be mad at me AND I have to live.|12782
I hope it works for me.|12782
"'I cannot even kill myself right'""[BK][BK]And '""damn, my ass hurts'""[BK][BK]I had tied the noose just like pictures shown, but the only reachable branch on any of the trees around snapped under my weight and I plopped on my ass in the mud."|12782
I just kinda laid there after that, sobbing while being rained on.|12782
[BK][BK]That was 3 years ago, my life is beyond amazing now for anyone concerned.|12782
"There has not been a moment I regret it not happening."""|12782
I was mortified when I just did not fall unconscious.|12782
I researched so much on the internet and compiled a seemingly perfect way to guarantee death.|12782
I mixed awful amounts of morphine, diclazepam and alcohol in an attempt to kill myself via respiratory failure but it was not enough.|12782
[BK][BK]I even found myself the perfect spot to pass away, in a small secluded field inside the bushes where I hoped no one would find me.|12782
The most painful part of the ordeal was going back home, knowing you failed to even end your own life and face the ones you love, unaware that they very nearly lost me.|12782
[BK][BK]You really have to experience the dread you feel after a failed attempt to truly understand it, not that I would wish that upon anyone.|12782
I had swallowed a couple of capfuls of Pine-Sol, waited for around 15-20 minutes while a thought about what I would done and the consequences of it, made myself throw it up, then blacked out and woke up the next day on the couch.|12782
My first thought was something along the lines of: 'I cannot believe this.|12782
"This cannot be real.'"""|12782
Everything seemed off and a bit distorted and I knew that my last thought before I blacked out was that I was dying and nothing was going to stop it.|12782
I felt awful in a physical sense, but relieved that I was still here.|12782
[BK][BK]My dad thought that I was just really, really sick (which, technically, I was), so he had not bothered me about going to school that day and put a blanket on me at some point.|12782
When I told him about the full situation years later, he did lots of research on depression, helped me get appointments with therapists and psychiatrists, and has been there for me overall.|12782
[BK][BK]To this day, when I reach a particularly low state of mind, I think of my dad and all his support, and it gives me enough strength to push through to the end of the day.|12782
"I try to stay alive for myself most of all, but if I am honest, my father is one of the main reasons why I live."""|12782
I took 25 co-proxamol tablets when I was 15.|12782
I was all ready to go, I even in a total nerd moment looped this: https://youtu.be/hKIZCmlDrWk?t=6 in the background.|12782
"[BK][BK]All that happened was I vomited it all right back up, I assume I also 'Napoleoned'"" went into school the next day as if normal."|12782
"[BK][BK]I had several more '""attempts'"", most they were self harming through cuts - I still have the scars."|12782
[BK][BK]Around 18 things got much better, and now at 32 I still occasionally have those thoughts.|12782
"There was abuse in one form or another in childhood and mentally I have never really accepted the fact that I '""deserve'"" a good life."|12782
It''s part of a self destruction bent I have, which at the moment has taken it is form in painkiller addiction.|12782
I also have an auto-immune disease, so on really bad days that helps drag me down further.|12782
[BK][BK]Sadly these things you sometimes never get over.|12782
Occasionally I will think that my wife would be far better off with the mortgage paid off and nice pot of £100,000 from my death in service benefit.|12782
I have not actively tried since I was a teenager, and I seem to be fairly bullet proof with the painkillers.|12782
Long ago I should encountered renal damage, but nope.|12782
They are fine.|12782
Due to my illness I have full bloods every 6 weeks and always normal.|12782
[BK][BK]Frankly I am glad I live in the UK.|12782
"If I would had access to firearms, well I would not be typing this now!"""|12782
The first thing I remember is waking up to my friends banging on my door and barging into my flat.|12782
I would been unconscious for 3 days, because I had snorted a strong sleeping drug.|12782
The last thing I remember before passing out was a feeling of utter peace and happiness, since I felt like I was finally fading away and leaving all my problems behind.|12782
[BK]My friends got me to the hospital where I was incoherent.|12782
I was hooked up to an IV, which I managed to rip out, and I remember asking the nurse for a paper and pen so I could write a strongly worded letter to David Cameron about the state of the mental health services.|12782
(Haha)[BK]After I became lucid again, my first conscious thoughts were of shame, guilt, and embarrassment.|12782
My dad had been in everyday and I know it killed him to see me that way.|12782
[BK]All in all, I was in hospital for a week, and when I got home I just felt even worse than I had done.|12782
[BK][BK]Since then, I have still struggled a lot with severe anxiety and depression, but I have promised myself to stop all the self harm and suicide attempts.|12782
I have relapsed a couple of times, but I am getting there.|12782
I realised I was fed up with being a prisoner to my own mind, and if over 7 years the NHS were only going to prescribe me useless pills, I would take matters into my own hands.|12782
I bought myself a book on mindfulness, and it is really helping.|12782
I am optimistic I will be 'fixed' by the end of the year, and my only regret is waiting so long to do so.|12782
[BK][BK]My advice to anyone in a similar position: If you are feeling hopeless, worthless, and like life is pointless, the best thing to do is to talk to someone close to you.|12782
You can only bottle up your feelings for so long before they overwhelm you.|12782
Don't be proud.|12782
Talking about how you feel is not a sign of weakness.|12782
Things can get better.|12782
X|12782
Bit late to the thread, but I will post it anyway.|12782
Good to get it off my chest.|12782
[BK][BK]I tried to hang myself in 8th grade.|12782
I was bullied a lot in middle school, could not trust my friends, picked on by teachers and students alike.|12782
At home my parents were always on my case about very small things, but that stacked with the school shit took its toll.|12782
One night after a particularly bad day, I decided to end it.|12782
Nothing could be worse than the life I was living.|12782
[BK][BK]I took a wire coat hanger and twisted it around my neck, twisted it around a clothing bar in my closet, and dropped my legs out.|12782
Immediately I was overwhelmed with fear and regret, and thought about my family, my brothers, everyone who I cared about.|12782
I felt selfish and stupid and scared, but my legs stopped working and I could not stand up.|12782
Slowly my vision started to fade, and I thought I was about to die.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up afterwards on the ground, because the hanger had snapped at some point.|12782
As soon as I realized I was alive, I just started bawling.|12782
I was so happy that I had failed, so happy that I had not died.|12782
I just laid there on the ground for a long time, so happy that I was alive.|12782
[BK][BK]So, to answer your question, my first thought was one of relief.|12782
One more time|12782
'...God.|12782
"Dammit.'"""""|12782
"'God damn it, maybe if I do not answer, they will go away'"" I did not even get a chance to fall asleep, I would told my best friend I cut myself really deep and I guess that was enough for her to call an ambulance."|12782
I laid there as I heard the paramedics pound on the door, eventually break the glass and let themselves in.|12782
They eventually found me and took me to the ambulance.|12782
[BK][BK]At the hospital I felt like I failed, sure, but maybe now I would get the help I needed.|12782
It took a while for any family member to show up, and it was my uncle and cousin, they said my grandma (who raised me) fell leaving the other hospital my grandpa was in when she heard about me and tried to run, she broke her cheek bone and had to get stitches.|12782
They did not say much, did not seem very concerned and eventually left to go check on my grandma.|12782
[BK][BK]Eventually my grandma showed me, by now I had drank my 4 bottles of charcoal and puked several times.|12782
She of course was upset but only made me feel worse by saying she cracked her face trying to get to me, I still blame myself.|12782
She left within half an hour, had to go check on grandpa because he did not know what was going on, so I was alone again.|12782
[BK][BK]And I was alone for several hours, waiting to be transferred to the hospital with the psych ward.|12782
Being alone and still feeling like the least priority did not make me feel better.|12782
What did was the nurse who kept checking on me.|12782
He brought me a portable dvd player and some movies to keep me busy, he checked on me a bunch and said he would been where I was, and that really helped.|12782
"[BK][BK]"""|12782
[serious] after many different attempts since my child/teen years I nearly succeeded at hanging myself in the closet 5 years ago.|12782
I was hanging, became unconscious, somehow ended up on the floor and came to, my first thoughts were: 'fuck my life, it didnt work.|12782
how did i get down from there?|12782
why is my body feeling so numb everywhere?|12782
i need someone.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Had marks all over my neck, face, bloodshot eyes etc."|12782
Couldnt hide those marks so people eventually knew what id tried to do and my family made me feel like shit when they saw those marks.|12782
"jeez, when you make me feel that way,i wonder why i had tried to suicide in the first place..."""|12782
Honestly just felt kind of empty.|12782
Ashamed of myself.|12782
The thoughts of everyone I knew slowly forgetting about me and moving on with their lives terrified me.|12782
I did not care about who I would have hurt by dying, rather I cared about who would be able to move on without much of a thought, like I had from friends and acquaintances who had died.|12782
It is narcissistic, I know.|12782
But honest.|12782
I simply did not want to disappear forever.|12782
And I was disappointed that all my depression and one moment of extreme weakness lead to nearly erasing myself from existence.|12782
I was young, and thought my pellet gun was powerful enough to do the job.|12782
It took a good long moment to realize I had not succeeded.|12782
"My first thought was 'fuck'"" my second though was that I had shot  through my temple and hit my eye somehow and blinded it."|12782
It''s was terrifiying.|12782
"What really happend was there was so much blood, it was covering my eye."""|12782
"Two of the times it was, 'How the fuck am I still alive and how the fuck did I not vomit all those pills back up?'"""|12782
"shortly followed by, '""I guess I better go to the hospital.'"""""|12782
"'What the fuck am I gonna tell people?'"""""|12782
"'Now I have to clean the blood off the side of the bathtub.'"""""|12782
 'I couldn''''t even manage to disappear.|12782
"i cannot even get this right'""[BK][BK]This was my final attempt a few years ago, when one of my friends found me, and told me that if I ever did this again and managed it, she would follow me, because I was the only good thing in her life back then."|12782
[BK]Thanks to her I am still standing, and have not done it since.|12782
But it is harrowing when you suddenly find  yourself breathing when you should not be, when you discover yourself on the floor with a snapped rope.|12782
I would tried multiple times and each time after I asked myself why did I want to do it.|12782
Why did I want to disappear.|12782
[BK]I am glad I had her, if I did not I probably would not be here anymore, because thosee thoughts do not go easily.|12782
[BK]Even these days I find myself occasionally, when times get really hard and I end up feeling alone, wishing that I would managed it.|12782
Even thinking how to do it fast and easy.|12782
[BK][BK]But it is not worth it anymore.|12782
Despite the dark sides you gotta look to the happy sides, to the people who care, even when they do not seem to, or when they are angry with you, or when they ignore you.|12782
[BK]Because as much as you want to disappear to make sure they are happy, because you feel you drag them down, in the end you hurt them more when you go.|12782
"[BK][BK]Thank you '""M.G'"" for teaching me that."""|12782
damn.|12782
did not work|12782
Super late, but I was terrified of telling my mom.|12782
She screamed at me, told me all about how stupid and selfish I was, but eventually called an ambulance.|12782
"'Confirmation that I am a complete failure, I cannot even succeed at killing myself.'"""|12782
- thought that the first time, the second time, and the third time.|12782
"Finally decided that I am just too bad at trying to kill myself so I will give up and do something else."""|12782
'Wow.|12782
"You could not even do this right.'"""""|12782
"'I cannot even kill myself right.'"""""|12782
This is a great read.|12782
I have been planning and wanting to die for the most part of 4 years now.|12782
Only thing that is kept me going is sit at home making fucking stupid youtube videos.|12782
Over 800 now...|12782
I have been in treatment.|12782
I am on anti depressant.|12782
Just nothing seems fucking worth it.|12782

"'well there goes that idea'"" """|12782
'I cannot do ANYTHING right.|12782
I cannot even kill myself correctly.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I still feel like I do not do anything well."""|12782
I have not personally tried to commit suicide, but my best friend did.|12782
She tried to take a bunch of pills to overdose.|12782
I remember trying to take care of her after and get her to the hospital, but she refused to go.|12782
I remember her being absolutely out of it, confused, she said she was numb, and she had a lot of blurry vision.|12782
The next day she tried to go to work and was not much better, and her coworker finally made her to go the hospital.|12782
She ended up getting 5150'd and they released her the next day, did not pump her stomach either.|12782
[BK][BK]I do remember her being very upset, angry, and depressed that she did not die and she ended up being 5150'd.|12782
But a few weeks later she found out she was pregnant.|12782
Thankfully, after having her first daughter she is been doing a lot better.|12782
She also had a son about a year later.|12782
She is been getting help for her anxiety and depression and I have seen a huge change in her.|12782
[BK][BK]I can tell you that it was one of the worst experienced of my life, it was heart breaking.|12782
I felt not good enough to help her, I felt helpless.|12782
I know there was nothing you could do, but when my best friend, who is like my sister, tried to die on purpose...|12782
It was just horrible.|12782
[BK][BK]It has now been about 4 years since the incident, and we lost a friend due to liver disease.|12782
After that she came to me an apologized for ever putting me through that grief and she would never do it again.|12782
I, of course, appreciated the gesture but told her she did not have to apologize.|12782
I understood she was in pain.|12782
But I am so happy she still walks the earth and is better.|12782
I think my post got deleted I am not sure but I will re post it[BK]So I have been depressed for a few years now and I lost grasp of late 2015 earlier this year.|12782
I had been getting bullied for years and I did not really care or think of it much till recently and it got to me so much that I could not take it.|12782
If you saw what I had posted earlier I said I had drank to try and kill my self but it did not work, so I did the same thing but tried lean and other drugs with it.|12782
As it had hit me before I was even dead I felt dead, but I finally had passed out.|12782
I woke up the next day maybe at 7-8 in the evening, my parents and brother had been gone the whole weekend and I woke up and just started vomiting everywhere.|12782
After that I still felt off, and sick almost but nothing of the night before and it scared the shit out of me.|12782
It made me realize that I could get through it and I just need to tough it out.|12782
[BK][BK]I am glad I am here today.|12782
'This is a lot of stitches.|12782
"'""[BK]'""How did I get here?"|12782
"'""[BK]'""Where is the car?"|12782
"'""[BK]"""|12782
My mom will be SO pissed if she finds out.|12782
Was not happy and was disappointed.|12782
Took a lot of counseling but I am doing better.|12782
One day at a time.|12782
I should let the dog out.|12782
i do not even remember, I just felt awful for the next 3 days.|12782
"[BK][BK]i had several 'attempts'"" before that but I honestly just think it was a cry for attention."|12782
i intentionally did not take a lethal dose.|12782
[BK][BK]but this time was different.|12782
each time I have an episode I get less and less scared, more and more impulsive.|12782
[BK][BK]it was a few days after Christmas.|12782
my sleep schedule was really fucked up, i did absolutely nothing all day, and I had been mentally screwing with a guy twice my age because I was so unhappy with myself.|12782
my mom (I am a teenager btw) came in at like 8 AM and I was still awake.|12782
she started yelling at me for doing nothing and sleeping all day.|12782
"I was really apathetic and just kept saying '""ok.'"" I was too tired to care."|12782
She slammed my door and I fell asleep.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up at like 5pm.|12782
I do not really know what was going through my head.|12782
Probably barely anything.|12782
I went downstairs and locked myself in the bathroom and got the Arsenal of pills out because I found where my mom hid them.|12782
She was in the room right next to me.|12782
[BK][BK]I just kind of lined them up.|12782
It was almost like I was playing with them at that point.|12782
Then I started slowly taking them.|12782
I had been in there for a while.|12782
"My mom heard the sound of pills being '""shaken'"" so she came to the door and told me she knew what I was doing."|12782
She was not all that panicked.|12782
She got a screwdriver and started unscrewing the door handle,obviously taking her time.|12782
So I just said fuck the rest of the pills I lined up, emptied a bottle of sleeping pills into my hand and took them all at once.|12782
[BK][BK]i am really tiny.|12782
108 lbs and not even 5 feet.|12782
So it really fucked me up.|12782
"My mom finally got the door open, said '""really?'"""|12782
and I just walked past her.|12782
It hit me almost immediately.|12782
As I was walking up the stairs I started feeling really heavy...really out of it.|12782
I just sort of fell onto my bed and was staring at the ceiling.|12782
[BK][BK]my mom came in my room and started saying the stuff she usually does.|12782
I do not even remember what she said, everything about my life and me was blurry as I was laying there.|12782
I felt my heart slowing, it was getting really hard to breathe.|12782
"I was struggling to keep myself awake...and then I thought '""oh fuck, am I dying?"|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Then I felt completely disassociated."|12782
The REAL me could not speak.|12782
It was kind of like...my subconscious was speaking?|12782
I just remember crying for my mom.|12782
"Just saying '""mom, mom'"" as she stood in the doorway and said nothing."|12782
I could not even turn my head to look at her.|12782
I passed out.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up a little bit later and started choking on my own vomit.|12782
I ran to the bathroom and continued throwing up.|12782
I was really disoriented, and still found myself calling for my mom.|12782
My little brother saw (3) and got my mom to come upstairs.|12782
She just stood there and watched me gag/vomit.|12782
"Then, in the most apathetic tone, said[BK][BK]'""You better just go to the kitchen and drink some milk'"" before walking away."|12782
[BK][BK]I do not really think I thought anything when I woke up.|12782
I did not feel anything either.|12782
"I was just kind of like, '""ok.'"""""|12782
Hello!|12782
I am glad you started this thread, hopefully experiences can be read to help save other people.|12782
[BK][BK]I tried to kill myself Janurary of last year by ingesting a mix of amphetamines, prescription sleeping medicine, and acetaminophen.|12782
I was in my bathroom waiting to die, when I realized what I was doing was not going to solve my problems.|12782
The things I went through were purely material, and had no impact on my future.|12782
I knew my decision was a mistake as soon as I swallowed everything.|12782
[BK][BK]I immediately called my mother, told her my situation, and she hauled ass to my home while I made myself throw up.|12782
All I could do was apologize to her, but she said I had nothing to apologize for.|12782
She was just glad I was still with her.|12782
[BK][BK]I checked into a hospital, took up yoga, and left with a new outlook.|12782
It gets hard sometimes, but I remember where I couldve been, and I feel greatful.|12782
'Be patient.|12782
One day ethical euthanasia will allow you to stop burdening those around you.|12782
"'""[BK][BK] I am still patiently waiting as I attempt to study for better treatments for others with my chemistry/biology degree. """|12782
Weirdly enough, I felt relief.|12782
I was feeling shitty at the time, and honestly felt like some force just hated me and wanted me to die, one of the typical symptoms of depression.|12782
So when I survived the jump off a bridge, I realised it was up to me where I take my life, and the stupid voice in my head meant nothing.|12782
I actually did not even realize killing myself Was what I tried to do.|12782
When I woke up though it was clear because I was disappointed I woke up.|12782
Not like the other times I was disappointed for waking up, this time I expected not to.|12782
"The first thing I thought was 'I guess I have to go to school today'"""""|12782
Maybe next time.|12782
I have had depression for 6 years (still have it)[BK]Tried to get help, at the time I was getting assessed at a new place for psychiatric help, my doctor took the piss out of me wanting to kill myself so I never went back there.|12782
[BK]Then last year I spent the week getting drunk by myself and took my motorbike out and purposely crashed into a truck, I missed by an inch and instead broke the shit out of my leg.|12782
[BK]I did not tell anybody I tried to kill myself so people purely think I am retarded now.|12782
[BK]|12782
I was 15 when I was diagnosed with depression and I attempted Suicide at 16 (and then again at 17)[BK][BK]I attempted to hang myself with some rope that I bought from the local hardware store.|12782
I had enough of pretty much everything at that time, school grades were low, friends turned into bullies and my family were abusive and just down right horrible to me ever since my grandfather past away (when I was 3)[BK][BK]It was a thursday night and when my grandmother was not near my room that is when I tied a noose from the various videos and instruction things I read online and I got a chair from the kitchen which was a few feet away and i remember hanging for about 5 sec.|12782
I felt the pressure on my neck and felt extremely hot as i kicked the chair from under me.|12782
the rope eventually broke and I fell to the ground.|12782
I remember just coughing a lot and my grandmother came in to ask what that noise was and she saw it all and I pretty much had to persuade for to take me to the hospital.|12782
I had rope burn and I was there for 1 month.|12782
I could not have coat hangers, shoe laces, string anything that I could hang myself with, no mobile phones, no computer besides the one in the mental institute part which was for 'learning only' Family would call up those in there with me.|12782
There was about 18 rooms I was in the 8th room and it was a mix of boys and girls under 20.|12782
I was the youngest there twice when I have been.|12782
I spent my month there just being away from everyone, drawing,writing and talking to doctors about things.|12782
[BK]My family or friends never called me, I spent my whole month there just alone, my second time 1 year later I spent 3 weeks there because I begged them to take me out, I did not like being in that part of the hospital.|12782
Although it was the safest place for me.|12782
Late to the party but I wanted to share.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up in the emergency room and immediately got gilt tripped by a (well meaning) nurse so my first though was guilt for how I would have made the people I left behind feel.|12782
[BK][BK]When I came to a bit more I had a meeting with the local phyc team I got a tone of support I did not have before like an actual physiologist and a RGN.|12782
I remembered (some of) how hard the paramedics had fought to keep me alive.|12782
Even my dad was nice to me for the first time ever.|12782
[BK][BK]It made me realize there is a system of people out there to help you out of that situation.|12782
[BK][BK]Also Britbong and bloody grateful to be.|12782
I would probably be dead now without the NHS.|12782
[BK][BK][BK][BK]|12782
In all honesty, it was something along the lines of 'Ow.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Tried hanging myself and the belt I was using was old and cracked, snapped just as I was about to lose consciousness."|12782
Ended up hitting the floor ass first, felt that shit all the way up my spine.|12782
[BK][BK]After that it was a lot of crying and cursing, then as time went on I slowly realized it was for the better.|12782
Took me years to finally reveal it to my mother, by which point I would finally exercised most of my demons and was able to handle my shit.|12782
[BK][BK]I still think on it from time to time and wonder.|12782
"I am glad it did not work."""|12782
'I knew it.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]To be honest, out of the 7 attempts I have had at my own life I never really expected any to succeed."|12782
I just downed a bunch of pills that would probably kill me, or half heartedly slipped on a noose, even slitting my wrists, I did not go the full mile.|12782
I just did it.|12782
Death was not the solution, it was a means to the solution.|12782
I always just pretended that once I would done this, once I would gone through with it, my problems would go away.|12782

Throwaway account here...[BK][BK]I was in college living with my best friend, her boyfriend, and another guy they knew.|12782
I followed her to that school in hopes she would finally come to her senses and be with me.|12782
We got really serious.|12782
To the point we started  imagining our wedding.|12782
Things fell apart and it was just sleepless night after night.|12782
She took interest in the other guy and one night we were all kinds drinking, they went upstairs and she implied she was going up to bang him just to piss me off.|12782
I just felt heartbroken.|12782
Everything I have up.|12782
I had no future, I failed college, lost my childhood home, insane debt, no job.|12782
I looked at the smirnoff ice and decided to chug as many as I could so I would not wake up.|12782
It was strange I did not view it as suicide.|12782
I was young and stupid and obviously did not know anything about Smirnoff since I only works up with a bad headache and heartache.|12782
Anytime now I find someone have difficult times I show them the rocky Balboa speech when he is talking to his son about life.|12782
First though: 'I do not want it to end like this.|12782
"'""[BK]A little bit late and not too sure if this really counts, but here''s my story:[BK]I was depressed as a teenager but was too afraid of the possible nothing after death, so i was always too afraid to try."|12782
I hated myself for not being able to just do it and get it over with.|12782
Instead i got into as many drugs as a child could with no money, which is a surprising amount.|12782
I was with my SO at the time and did a few too many and overdosed, so instead of a high to make me senseless i tripped so bad i though that i died.|12782
Seconds felt like an eternity and everything that my senses perceived would repeat hundreds of times until they picked up something else to torture me with.|12782
After i came out of the experience, the SO was holding me and crying.|12782
She told me that i was flipping between shallow rapid breaths to not breathing.|12782
I was like that for almost an hour.|12782
After i threw up a few times, i laid dow and cried until my eyes were dry.|12782
After that day, i had PTSD?|12782
(Would have the same feeling) I hated every day after and sometimes felt like i did die on that day.|12782
Thankfully for me it moved me away from the terrible people that i used to call my friends and kept me away from drugs.|12782
I am better now, but still have anxiety when i feel get Deja Vu.|12782
"[BK]Sorry for the bad format, on mobile. """|12782
I tried to electrocute myself by sticking a spoon into a power outlet.|12782
I am trans, and I could not take the pain and the hate and the rejection any more.|12782
[BK][BK]All I managed to do was burn my hand and fling my arm back hard, and the spoon melted a little at the handle.|12782
I still have it in a box.|12782
"[BK][BK]All I could think was 'I cannot even kill myself right'""."|12782
"[BK][BK]I took a long time to come to terms with my life."""|12782
"After my fourth attempt just over two years ago, at 16, I woke up in a hospital and thought, 'Maybe there is a reason.'"""|12782
"I still have not found it yet, but I will not stop looking."""|12782
"I have DID so sometimes I 'lose control'"" of my body, 1 of 3 identity''s are '""in control'"" of my body at any time, me, a suicidal/attention seeking one, and a pointless one, I am not able to recall any events that happen so sometimes it is quite the surprise."|12782
[BK][BK]Most of the time I am in control, once a day the pointless one takes control and it tends to just carry on as I would with small differences, the suicidal one takes control about once a fortnight, when it is in control it will put me in a dangerous position, stand in the middle of a road, hold a knife to my body, last week it climbed out of a window and stood on the window ledge, then It just gives up on the control and I am back in control, left in the dangerous situation.|12782
"[BK][BK]The first time the suicidal one took control I was walking towards a shopping centre, lost control along the way and when I was back in control I was standing on a train track with a train coming at me about 50 foot away, It was the first time I would lost control and I was not fully aware of what was happening and I just stood there for what seemed like forever thankfully a guy grabbed me and yanked me from the tracks saving me, then he swore at me got up and walked off saying '""Fucking idiots cannot even kill themselves properly'"" such a nice guy."|12782
[BK][BK]I have gotten to understand what is happening now so I am able to react to these dangerous situations quicker and I am rarely hurt any more.|12782
[BK][BK]Though it is not exactly suicide it would of been and what are the personalities if not my own stray thoughts, though I have never wanted to commit suicide.|12782
"[BK][BK]The first time it happened my only though was '""What the fuck just happened'"" after I would figured out what was happening my first though is usually '""For fucks sake would you fuck off trying to hurt me.'"""""|12782
"'I am back.'"""|12782
Waking up in my bed after I  swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills and chased it with half a bottle of Captain Morgan.|12782
My marriage had fallen apart and I was also dealing with PTSD from my military service.|12782
After passing out here it felt like I was falling and flying at the same time.|12782
I woke up in what looked like a demented circus filled with skulls and all kinds of creepy workers.|12782
A man in a top hat walked up behind me and facepalmed.|12782
"'""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE?!'"""|12782
He shouted at me.|12782
Before I could explain he cussed me out.|12782
"'""Stop trying to get here!"|12782
It is not time yet you dumb fuck.|12782
You still got a quite a bit to learn.|12782
"Now go back AND STOP DOING ATUPID SHIT!'"""|12782
then he slapped me.|12782
You know that feeling you get when you get back home from a long trip?|12782
That is how I felt waking up at 943 in the morning the next day.|12782
I was alone but I knew it was not my time.|12782
"Ever since then no more attempts. """|12782
"'What is going on??'"""|12782
[BK]I woke up in bed, initially not knowing how I got there.|12782
I was living with my ex boyfriend due to our lease not being up for another couple of months.|12782
He came home and started yelling about what the noise was.|12782
I had been drunk the night before and spilled a bottle of rum on his iMac keyboard, it broke and was just making some noise on the computer.|12782
I had no recollection of what happened because I got drunk and took a handful of his prescribed sleeping pills.|12782
[BK][BK]Apparently it was not enough.|12782
I told him what I did and he was more angry that I took his pills as opposed to being worried about my health.|12782
[BK][BK]I spent the rest of the day with two close friends being in physical and mental pain, angry that I had failed.|12782
"[BK][BK]But after a while, and to this day, I am so happy I survived. """|12782
I had gotten a little too drunk the night before (I should not have been drinking) and I tried to throw myself in front of a car, and I would have succeeded if someone had not physically stopped me.|12782
I convinced my parents it was better for me to stay at home.|12782
[BK]I woke up the next morning sober and felt numb.|12782
I did not really know what happened other than fragments that started coming back to me.|12782
I did not really know what to do.|12782
I ended up sexting someone I had been talking to.|12782
Until the full gravity of what had happened hit me.|12782
(it is because of things like that that made me realise I had been using sex as an escape mechanism from dealing with any of my problems).|12782
[BK]I still think about that night a lot.|12782
I have not felt properly suicidal or as bad since then.|12782
[BK]|12782
Is that a... No that cannot be right...*slowly reaches down to my crotch* yup that is a cathader...|12782
They are going to take me away|12782
I had the noose tied and hanging in my closet.|12782
Speaker cable actually.|12782
I hung it and wrapped it around my neck.|12782
I fell and could feel the tightening.|12782
When I came to, I had many thoughts.|12782
First was why am I alive?|12782
Second, does anyone know?|12782
And third.|12782
What's a better way to get out|12782
I do not know if this counts as survival, but I remember the feeling of a few dozen adderol hitting my blood stream, and through the manic fear and anxiety came a sudden animalistic urge to live.|12782
I induced vomiting and then just sat in the bathroom for hours ashamed and unsure of what to do.|12782
I never told my parents, or basically anyone else for that matter.|12782
I woke up to see my sister crying her eyes out and my parents calling 911.|12782
I untied the failed noose from my closet and just laid beside her in my bed as she wept, sad that i tried but grateful i didnt die.|12782
"All i could think was 'Fuck... i wish they didnt see me like this'"" and in a way, wishing it had worked because of that."|12782
But also overwhelmed with how deeply they cared.|12782
"[BK][BK]I have not tried since then."""|12782
better make the most out of it then.|12782
I was like, ' What the hell just happened?|12782
"'"", as I woke up in a hospital bed twitching and convulsing."""|12782
I woke up on the bathroom floor staring at the ceiling after trying to slit my wrists (I did not cut deep enough or... Something) my wife was out of town..|12782
"I remember thinking 'my bathroom sucks, did I really want it to be my last image?'"""|12782
And..|12782
I have not tried again.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]...|12782
"I am scared I will again."""|12782
"'Suicide is a permanent answer to a temporary problem.'"""|12782
""""|12782
'That charcoal stuff that they gave me to absorb the pills I took is going to make my shit black?|12782
"Fucking sweet.'"""|12782
""""|12782
I tried to starve myself to death last year and from all the vomiting and cramps and my hair falling off I could tell I was succeeding, and then suddenly came this moment where I blacked out softly like I did not even realize it and I thought I had finally died.|12782
[BK][BK]I saw my now fiance's face in my head.|12782
So clear and so beautiful.|12782
They were crying and I guess it was a delusion but that was my first thought.|12782
Fuck, my cat probably should not be licking up all that blood.|12782
Tried cutting my wrist.|12782
Even numbed it up with lidocaine which I stole from the hospital I worked.|12782
Cutting it up to about the radial artery when I saw my cat lapping the blood of the floor which kinda snapped me back to reality.|12782
Didn't stich it up, it healed ok. Nobody suspects this of me so if anybody would ever comment on my faint scar I will say something along the lines of a drunk night and a glass sliding door.|12782
[BK]I actually like the scar because it reminds me that I am so much better even when I have a bad day.|12782
I tried again, first attempt was hanging as well, then I got my gun, really I was not able to pull the trigger because the thought of a loved one finding me that way.|12782
I ended up glad that I chose to live life is so good now.|12782
I wondered why I had such a bad taste in my mouth and why sleeping pills would cause you to spew up something black.|12782
I did not know about the charcoal technique until 2 days later when I noticed how black it was in the toilet after going #2.|12782
I was 19 at the time.|12782
[BK][BK]I am very glad that my life was saved, I was able to move on from the whole ordeal, and I wish more people realized that life can change and things does get better if you seek help and support.|12782
The thing is with a gun, you either pull the trigger or someone catches you and thinks it is a good idea to wrestle it out of your hands.|12782
Either sheer courage or complete reckless abandon has to overcome you if you think it is a good idea to put yourself in harm's way.|12782
[BK][BK]Well, when the woman I loved, the person I never wanted to seen hurt, has had it with the relationship after 3 years of living together said enough was enough, everyone is running high on emotions.|12782
The thought of being abandoned after I had envisioned living a life beyond myself was about to peace out, I could not control myself.|12782
I was no longer present mentally.|12782
I felt like I was observing everything.|12782
After 5 years in the Army this was what was going to kill me, I just felt numb.|12782
The only thing I could consciously do was give up my gun.|12782
I did not want to hurt her or anyone in the apartment compound since 5.56 rounds penetrate sheet rock like nothing.|12782
[BK][BK]After all my years of service, I was not about to hurt anyone else in my selfish act.|12782
I gave up the gun.|12782
I opened the door.|12782
I emptied my pockets.|12782
I waited till the cops showed up.|12782
I complied.|12782
[BK][BK]To this day, I have not been able to be recover.|12782
My number was up that moment, and whoever existed then died.|12782
I have not been able to hear his voice ever since.|12782
All my childhood memories just seem like some vivid memory that someone else lived.|12782
I am a husk of my former self, someone that everyone who does not know what happened still look to me for guidance and inspiration.|12782
I am just fake version of my former self who is merely impersonating him.|12782
[BK][BK]The only thing I am doing now is existing so all the people who claim to love me do not have to actually deal with me no longer physically being here.|12782
If I could, I would erase my existence and try to reform some new life, but I know that is not going to solve anything.|12782
I just do not want to bear this identity I have anymore.|12782
"'I am so glad I told someone before I bled out'"" [BK][BK]My mom was drugged out on fentanyl patches and would pass out with a lit cig in her hand all the time."|12782
She got better, then worse, then better.|12782
[BK][BK]That was when I was 14.|12782
I am 23 now, married to a man who would give me the world on a silver platter, and the most amazing kid I could ever dream of.|12782
I have had friends successfully end their lives in the years since then.|12782
If you are feeling hopeless or thinking of going that route, please just stop to consider that life DOES get better.|12782
"I will spare you all of the '""suicide is a long term solution to a short term problem'"" shit because that is already been said here, and it is true."|12782
"Just know that although I do not know you, I love you and I will always root for you. """|12782
do not remember it entirely, but i think i almost laughed out loud.|12782
the only thing preventing that was the fact i was scared shitless as to where i was  [BK]  [BK]subconsciously I am pretty sure i felt i was still alive, but the humor came in just as i realized that I would failed yet again.|12782
so much of a failure that i cannot even fucking die properly.|12782
fuck all of it, really|12782
I have tried 2 times.|12782
It was a time in my life when my girlfriend had broken up with me, I was 17, and I became severely depressed and had panic attacks.|12782
I thought noone would ever want me again and the loneliness was brutal and crushed me completely.|12782
We still lived together and I had to watch her bring home lots of boys, I am a girl so that felt extra weird, did I drive her to become straight?|12782
[BK][BK]Well onto det gory stuff.|12782
We had a extremely small bathroom and no ventilation in it, i covered it all with towles and had a small gas container, turned it on and waited.|12782
I passed out and then i heard screams suddenly and someone hitting me in the face, it was my ex.|12782
She had come home one day earlier from her new BF.|12782
I begged her to not call an ambulance and the condition was that i seek help.|12782
I hated myself even more, I could not even kill myself properly, and noone loved me.|12782
Fastforward a bit.|12782
I got diagnosed with borderline (wronly so).|12782
And got better.|12782
I met a boy and started college.|12782
[BK][BK]Suddenly it all crashed.|12782
My boyfriend broke up with me and I started to fail every exam in my university studies.|12782
That meant I got no more money for my studies.|12782
I decided I was done with life.|12782
Fuck everything.|12782
I had read online that you could kill yourself with bitter almonds, in high doses it becomes like cyanide.|12782
So i stuffed myself with a lot of pills first, anxiety medication and then 400 almonds.|12782
It was a hard job I tell you.|12782
I felt like my breathing was stopping I stopped seeing straight, everything became light and I was so happy cause I would get to die.|12782
I do not believe in god or another life so I was excited for the fact that everything would just end.|12782
"Suddenly my phone rings and stupid and 'high'"" as I am I answer it, it is a friend who hears I sound strange."|12782
She calls an ambulance and they break into my apartment and I am rushed to the hospital.|12782
Got my stomach pumped and some kind of clear red IV that would counter cyanide.|12782
I once again hated myself and was so disappointed I failed.|12782
I was the hospitals come and must see for all doctors, they have never heard of anytyhing like killing yourself with almonds.|12782
A shrink at the hospital came over and talked to me.|12782
I took her about 10 minutes and she suspected I had Bipolar disorder.|12782
[BK][BK]She was correct.|12782
[BK][BK]Today I still struggle with life but realize that when everything feels like I have hit bottom, just wait.|12782
It will get better, and get help!!|12782
I have medication that have saved my life today and a wonderful fiancee and soon a degree in sociology.|12782
"[BK][BK]( sorry if my english sucks, I am swedish)"""|12782
"'Fuck... Do I try again?'"""|12782
[BK][BK]I had hung myself with a belt, I was pretty young at the time, probably around 12 or 11.|12782
"It was mainly due to bullying, lots of kids told me '""kill yourself'"" on a daily basis."|12782
So that and just the added stress of my the constant fights with my parents pushed me to a breaking point.|12782
[BK][BK]So yeah I hung myself with a belt and when I did I blacked out and woke up to find the belt loop slipped.|12782
[BK][BK]I sat there for what felt like hours, when in reality it was probably just 30 minutes.|12782
"Then decided not to try again at the time I was still somewhat religious and considered it a '""sign from God'"" to not try again, or some kind of second chance."|12782
[BK][BK]My parents did not know for years, unlike most people I wish they had found me.|12782
Part of the reason I was pushed to a breaking point was constant fights with my parents.|12782
"Which would end with me locking myself in a room and repeatedly punching myself in the face while crying to '""punish myself for being a bad son'""."|12782
I had hoped if they found me they would ease off of me and get me help.|12782
My looking back I am pretty sure suicide attempt was a cry for help.|12782
[BK][BK]I had actually told my parents around 4  years later about my suicide attempt, in an attempt to get some therapy to move past the issues that pushed me to that point.|12782
"The response I got was '"" You did not attempt to commit suicide!"|12782
You''re lying.|12782
"At the most you just THOUGHT about it'""."|12782
"I love my parents but sometimes they can be really cold."""|12782
I remember slightly coming to in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, which they have told me did not happen but I clearly remember it.|12782
"[BK][BK]However, my first conscious thought when I *actually* came to, was *'I am going to have these gashes on my wrists for the rest of my life'""* and I broke down crying, only for a few minutes though."|12782
[BK][BK]I then just went completely numb, and decided if I was gonna be stuck here, I was gonna make it count.|12782
Not because I wanted to be alive, trust me, I did not.|12782
I still want to die, every fucking day.|12782
"I chose to make it count because I refused to go through that process of failing again. """|12782
The only time I had actually almost succeeded had put me in a coma for a couple of days, and then, at some point, I had coded, so they put me on life support.|12782
I was in and out during the beginning of it, as I could feel them placing the electrodes(?)|12782
on my scalp (the monitors).|12782
I thought they were getting ready to perform some kind of brain surgery on me.|12782
*Maybe I had died and they were just getting ready to harvest organs.|12782
*[BK][BK]Then I sank into a place where I did not exist and nothing around me existed and there I was not in this nonexistence, just kind of *being* and *not being*.|12782
[BK][BK]The first thing I heard upon resurfacing was the clock on the wall.|12782
Just kind *tick.tick.tick.tick.|12782
*'ing it is way forward.|12782
It was very loud.|12782
Then that faded somewhat behind the sounds of footsteps.|12782
And then those footsteps faded behind the sounds of voices.|12782
And then those voices faded behind the sounds of machines.|12782
And then those machines faded behind the rest of the noises coming from the area of the hospital I was in.|12782
[BK][BK]There was a pain in my throat, and I was unable to move.|12782
And then I remembered the last thing I heard when I had begun to black out in the beginning.|12782
[BK][BK]*He's pissed himself.|12782
*[BK][BK]And then I knew where I was and what was going on.|12782
And this machine was breathing for me, and there was a tube coming out of my dickhole, and there was a steady, rhythmic beeping going on beside me, and my dad was there, looking tired, and this whole scene was familiar.|12782
[BK][BK]And I wished I had succeeded *this* time because I ***hated*** coming to in hospitals and I ***hated*** seeing the aftermath of my pisspoor decision making, and I ***hated*** having to explain myself to people who were just going through the motions of *what did you take* and *how much did you take of it* and *why did you take it*, and I ***hated*** not having what I thought they wanted me to have in the way of answers because depression and psychosis and attempting suicide do not make sense and the reasons do not make sense and there are not always reasons to begin with.|12782
[BK][BK]I left two days later after spending a day in the psychiatric unit and being of sound enough mind to do what I always did best: talk my way out of anything.|12782
It's been 11 years and I have not thought about suicide seriously since.|12782
I consider that chapter in my life closed.|12782
Pain...|12782
I had tried to hang myself and the rope snapped.|12782
I wish I could say I had existential thoughts about my family or some such...|12782
But I was so panicked and in so much pain that I was trying to tear the rope off my neck for minutes after it had already gone.|12782
[BK][BK]I had almost no control at that point, my body's survival instincts had taken over.|12782
Once I could breathe again the rest of the pain hit: my legs from where I would fallen; my neck was bleeding from where my weight had worn through the skin; the blood vessels in my eyes had burst; I was a total mess.|12782
[BK][BK]I sat against a tree and sobbed for goodness knows how long.|12782
I called my mother because I was terrified I would try again and I did not want to because it hurt so damn much.|12782
Even years later I am still terrified that I will try again.|12782
Late to the party and not keen to overload on all these survivor stories in one got, so i thought i would share my story while reading.|12782
[BK][BK]My father successfully gassed himself when i was 14.|12782
[BK]Before this, i had planned and set my destiny date.|12782
After finding my father and dealing with the after math, I soon tried looking positive again.|12782
[BK]Fast forward 14 years.|12782
I have 2 young kids of my own.|12782
That drone is getting louder.|12782
That hole is getting deeper and darker.|12782
The blackness is chasing me HARD!|12782
I start digging into my throat with my pigging knife.|12782
My (then) SO rips it from my hand before i could get more than an inch.|12782
[BK]I admitted myself into a local mental health institute and spend then next month and a half recovering.|12782
[BK]That was a little over 5 years ago now and have now retrained in a field where i can help others feeling rough, i have minority custody of my kids and am loving life.|12782
[BK][BK]I am here to have a yarn with anyone that might be feeling like just reaching out.|12782
Stay Strong Live Long.|12782
Never alone!|12782
When I wa 17 (33 now) I decided enough was enough and decided to end it all by taking 50 or 60 generic PM sleep pills.|12782
"[BK][BK]The first thing I remember from the hospital was my mom standing there in tears ask/cry/screaming 'what have you done?!'"""|12782
"and I sat up straight (still on a severe acetominophen high) and denied doing anything"""|12782
It was kinda scary.|12782
I had stopped myself, and I found some scissors that were in my reach and cut the jumprope I had used.|12782
I brought up suicide and how I wanted to do it again, and I got bullied.|12782
I hate myself.|12782
I am sorry.|12782
"'my mom is going to be SO mad,  and this is going to cost SO much money'"" [BK][BK]"""|12782
I have had partial memory loss after a suicide attempt.|12782
I overdosed on my prescribed anti depressants and was in the hospital for three weeks.|12782
I remember nothing of those three weeks nor do I remember what made me decide to take my own life.|12782
I remember going to sleep that night crying and drifting into the darkness but that is it.|12782
I was conscious (but not all there according to family members) about 2 days later after being moved from CCU to ICU after being in a medically induced coma.|12782
My heart stopped a couple times the night of.|12782
When I became fully cognitive three weeks later I was a different person.|12782
I was no longer depressed and 6 months later was weened off my medications completely.|12782
This happened about 4 years ago and I still have no memories of that time period.|12782
I only know what I have been told from family members.|12782
I feel that there is a lot missing from my childhood memories as I can only call back upon two or three memories.|12782
I think my depression began when my father passed away and he was not very present in my life but I still can only recall one memory of him.|12782
the hardest part about repressed memories is not knowing what you have forgotten.|12782
I hope that one day I will remember again but I am also scared that if I remember again I may become depressed again.|12782
what if I forgot all of that stuff for a reason and that is the reason I am not depressed anymore?|12782
The human mind is a hell of a thing.|12782
The thoughts had been swirling in my head for weeks and I kept thinking I should try to run out into the road and get hit by a car.|12782
I zoned out so much, next thing I realise I was at the front door already.|12782
That kept happening everyday.|12782
[BK]Then I sat on the edge of my bedroom window, suddenly I started having thoughts about what would happen if I took off.|12782
Yeah, that did not happened either.|12782
[BK]I was really young back then that other suicide ideas did not occur to me as an idea (like hanging, drug overdose etc).|12782
I was not brought up with movies and had limited TV access so I never knew.|12782
"[BK]Right after the last cowardly 'attempt'"", I thought about the people that loved me, close friend and baby brother and sister."|12782
"I would give up everything for them."""|12782
Some one I had not seen in years decided to stop in randomly and found me.|12782
She got me down but really didnt say a lot.|12782
To this day she is the only person who knows this about me.|12782
I did get help.|12782
It took about 4 years of trying different things, but I got my bp1 under control.|12782
Im now living medication free which is nice.|12782
[BK][BK]Whats scary is my partner keeps talking about suicide and I just do not think I can cope.|12782
It just keeps triggering all the bad memories and he says theres nothing good in his life anymore (including me, which cuts me right through).|12782
even worse, I have no idea how to help him.|12782
Leaving is not really an option.|12782
I dont want to turn my back when the person I love is unwell.ental heakth funding cuts mean they dont take it seriously until there been an attempt.|12782
He does not believe in medication or therapy.|12782
It sucks.|12782
Whenever he talks about suicide I just cry because I dont know what to do to help him.|12782
I tried to od as a teenager, a friend kind of caught wind of what i was doing and told his parents who then called my mom.|12782
I was really pissed at the time, felt like my trust had been betrayed or some stupid shit like that.|12782
I lost a good bit of my motor functions for a bit and was close to blacking out by the time my mom busted through the door.|12782
I had to be carried around everywhere at the hospital and they made me drink charcoal, i could not do it on my own so the nurse had to bottle feed it to me like i was a child.|12782
I do not remember much about it, but i remember feeling embarrassed about the whole ordeal.|12782
[BK][BK]I think the first thought that i had is still the kind of thinking that keeps me going now.|12782
"'whatever, i guess I will live then.'"""|12782
I guess after realizing that i had not succeeded i just thought, that is it, it just was not meant to be.|12782
Really threw a lot of people off, including my therapist.|12782
I went from having really intense suicidal ideations to just kind of being okay with living.|12782
"Shit happens i guess."""|12782
My ex fiance tried.|12782
We were together for a few months at the beginning but he was still missing his ex at the time.|12782
He called me one night, saying he had a knife and he will kill himself if I did not call call his ex.|12782
Instead I called the police.|12782
They found him in the bush, bleeding and they took him to hospital.|12782
He was in the mental ward overnight, but he talked his way out.|12782
He admitted later on to me that he was not ready to leave.|12782
Months later, he said that he had burned himself and had his arm wrapped up in bandages.|12782
I saw his arms later.|12782
They were not burns.|12782
His arms have so many scars, they are like tattoo sleeves.|12782
But when you love someone, you learn to look past the scars.|12782
You learn to see them for who they really are, and people look at him all the time like he is crazy because of his arms.|12782
But he is brave and pretends not to notice the judgemental stares.|12782
He tried again and he said to me that the pain after cutting his wrists was the worst pain he is ever felt.|12782
It was so bad he never wanted to try it again, at least not that way.|12782
We are not together any more but people like him need a guardian angel to look over them and to take away their pain, mental or physical.|12782
For the people who feel such a deep level of sorrow and pain seem to also love and feel the universe in an equally profound way.|12782
We need more people like that to stay in this world.|12782
I hope he forever does.|12782
"My first thought was more or less:   [BK]'Screw it (it was a little more vulgar but you get the point), this will not kill me so I guess I will go to bed'""   [BK]I did not really think about what I would tried to do but I did not realize it until a few days later."|12782
"It''s been about a few months now and I still want to die but it is no longer big on my to-do list, ever since I have actually been feeling pretty good."""|12782
I worded that horribly.|12782
What I meant was that the system records the liquids going through and if it notices that there is a breach and turns itself off so you do not get an air bubble in your bloodstream.|12782
Sorry about that|12782
My family.|12782
[BK][BK]Through the most intense suicidal thoughts this comes to my mind.|12782
I hate the fact of this barrier.|12782
How they are gonna feel and cope.|12782
I cannot stand continually living everyday handicapped.|12782
I am on the autism spectrum, have bipolar disorder, and ADD.|12782
I have to be drugged just to stay 'sane'?|12782
I dropped out of university cause my intellect is not enough to be there, let alone the lower vocational trades jobs.|12782
I cannot even do anything!|12782
Even the basics of driving a car.|12782
Most of the time thinking, I wish I was not born, I wish my mum did not meet my dad because he has aspergers and because of that, I am witnessing their five sons, my brothers, literally fighting, arguing, smashing things between each other virtually everyday.|12782
My dad's the most threatening at this.|12782
I cannot stand it, I hate autism.|12782
[BK][BK]I feel alone.|12782
Who's gonna be at my funeral if I die?|12782
I am sad at how I cannot maintain friends.|12782
Stuff people take for granted.|12782
I do not look like I have autism, so I can make friends but cannot maintain them, I get liked and approached but am not socially intuitive.|12782
I have lost a lot of friends.|12782
I am upset of how the world is promoting acceptance of autism rather than seeing it as a disorder and the need to prevent and fix it.|12782
[BK][BK]I still get feelings of death.|12782
I have tried everything from psychology, and yes psychiatry.|12782
7 years of everything - if you have name it, I have tried it.|12782
It's a cause that is unknown.|12782
I hate autism.|12782
I am tired of staying 'sane'.|12782
I have attempted suicide too many times so far and each and every time I hate myself increasingly more and more for not going through with it.|12782
[BK]For the past two hours I have been considering it.|12782
[BK]It'd be perfect, it is storming here right now so the people I live with might not hear the gunshot as a gunshot.|12782
[BK]Life is shit and will not stop being shit.|12782
That I was such a weakling.|12782
That moment was when I lost all emotion and remorse.|12782
There's no happy or sad any more no lump in my throat when I was in distress.|12782
It's pretty great honestly.|12782
Now I am a person who thinks people who commit suicide are the biggest wastes ever.|12782
Glad I read this.|12782
Been though a similar situation.|12782
Indeed the depression sometimes gets a hold of me.|12782
Mentally I have to be tough to see the better side of things.|12782
It does get better with time.|12782
Although the depression still lingers.|12782
I have better days than bad days.|12782
I am glad you are still alive and doing well.|12782
I wish you all the happiness, love and positive energy ❤️❤️❤️|12782
Shit shit shit shit this is embarrassing.|12782
Im such a pussy i cant evem do that right.|12782
TL;dr - tried OD''ing, did not die, thankful for life and vowed to never commit again[BK][BK][BK]I tried to silently commit suicide without anybody knowing through overdosing on over-the-counter medication.|12782
At the time I did not see a point in life and I was just a teenager going through tough times (break-up and depression overall), so I decided why not end it all.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]In the end I came up with overdosing because I felt that it would hit me without knowing it.|12782
I ended up taking two full bottles of Tylenol PM extra strength expecting to die from liver failure.|12782
"It was a funny feeling at first, as soon as I took the first bottle I had already begun to regret, and after the second, I was absolutely devastated, like 'what the hell did I just do?!'"""|12782
As I went to sleep expecting to die, I began to involuntary cry and I absolutely knew I was going to the other side.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]Fortunately enough, I was awoken in the middle of the night with terrible pains, and I hurriedly rushed to the toilet and proceeded to vomit tons and tons of what seemed like reddish solids, and oh boy it hurt like hell.|12782
I was hovering over the toilet for almost a good hour, hell I am beginning to remember the feeling typing this out.|12782
I could not drink or eat anything without the feeling of vommitting for almost four weeks.|12782
"[BK][BK][BK]After all was said and done though, I was glad to be alive and vowed myself to never do anything that stupid again."""|12782
suicide|12782
When I saw my dad holding my hand in the hospital where I had my stomach pumped I honesty had no words of feelings...|12782
I truthfully never thought about the people I loved and how deep that would hurt them until I saw the damage it did to my parents...|12782
Even today they constantly are checking up on me and making sure I am okay.|12782
Honestly I kept thinking how do I even go from here...|12782
I was back to the reality that I am back to square one but now it is even worse because look at the damage I have caused.|12782
Save.|12782
i gotta get the fuck out this hospital immediately, holy fuck im in the most pain i have ever felt, kill me.|12782
all simultaneously.|12782
i woke up after a 5.5 week coma to find myself restrained to my bed, ~which was not really necessary, atrophy had left me completely unable to move~.|12782
at first i did not know why i was in the hospital, my husband told me i was in an accident.|12782
[BK][BK]as my husband and i talked i realized that alot of the dreams i had while in my coma had elements of reality woven into them as my brain was picking up stimulus from the environment around me.|12782
my dreams were very vivid and clear and i remember in 3 of them committing suicide.|12782
so i asked my husband if i was there because I would committed suicide and his face told me all i needed to know.|12782
my first thought/feelings, shame and guilt.|12782
To be honest, I felt a moment of clarity .|12782
I realized that I was here for a reason and that I could be a light for those in the dark.|12782
Since then I have been involved in various interventions  and such.|12782
I woke up to see a nurse standing by me.|12782
The first time I tried to commit suicide I was 14,and was found in a park.|12782
My first thought / feeling...|12782
Embarrassed.|12782
Which quickly turned to anger, and sadness, as the nurse told me my family was notified but refused to come see me because I was just looking for attention.|12782
I had failed tests, failed relationships, but nothing felt as crushing as knowing you failed at dying.|12782
I live in a small town, so I also knew everyone else would know.|12782
And somehow it made me feel like the biggest piece of shit.|12782
I would describe it as crushing, overwhelming pressure.|12782
[BK][BK]My second time I was 17, I had drank a ton of booze, and then proceeded to swallow every pill, medication I could find in the bathroom.|12782
My neighbour found me on the floor as my parents and brother were away in Germany.|12782
When coherent enough to understand what was going on I sort of felt like, this is the second time, maybe I am not supposed to die.|12782
Because people keep intervening.|12782
So I asked the nurse if I could stay for a bit, get myself some help.|12782
Still felt embarrassed, still felt like a bag of shit.|12782
[BK][BK]I am 27, actually tomorrow's my birthday, so 28.|12782
No more attempts, but definitely a lot of suicidal ideation.|12782
I have good days and bad days.|12782
But I got tired of letting depression run my life, and the guilt, anger and embarrassment I still carry with me everyday of having two failed suicides... Or as I like to call it now, successful living.|12782
As well as every person I grew up with, went to school with, entire family.|12782
Everyone knows.|12782
Some deal with it better than others.|12782
I have never attempted suicide, but I have a friend.|12782
Let's call him X.|12782
[BK]X and I met while he was in a very dark place, over the internet.|12782
We have now been friends for three years, and let me tell you, he pulled himself out of a very, very dark place.|12782
He would attempt suicide at least once a month and every time he ended up in a hospital with annoyed parents and nurses watching him so he would not fuck with the tools.|12782
X still struggles today but as far as I know has not tried to kill himself in several months.|12782
I love him with all my heart (heh, gay) and so does his boyfriend (double gay.)|12782
He had, during attempts, cut his arms, overdosed, and jumped from his roof at least once.|12782
But he LIVED.|12782
[BK]And I get to meet him for the first time soon, and I cannot wait, and neither can he, and I am going to hug the hell out of him.|12782
Fuck|12782
'Shit.|12782
That fucking hurt.|12782
Should I try again?|12782
Not yet.|12782
Fuck.|12782
"I hope I can still use my hands.'"""""|12782
"'Fuck I cannot do anything right.'"""""|12782
'How the fuck am I going to clean these sheets.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Ended up throwing them away."""|12782
I was pissed at myself because I could not do it.|12782
Of all the simple things in life, disrupting the delicate processes that govern and maintain a human life should be laughably simple.|12782
There are dozens of ways to do it and good people die by fluke accidents every day.|12782
Why should I manage to survive by luck and chance and grace when I have wanted to die so very much?|12782
[BK][BK]I was so upset, despairing and distraught, it was just this simple little thing and I could not even do that.|12782
All I had to do was slide the sharp metal a mere 2 or 3 inches between my ribs, easier than cutting a steak, and I could not do it.|12782
Hell, all I had to do was hold the knife and *fall*, and I could not do that, either.|12782
I was 14 when I figured that out.|12782
[BK][BK]Maintaining life is so damn hard, taking it should be so easy...|12782
But I have never managed to succeed.|12782
I cannot drown, I have been swimming in alligator-infested waters and they did not come near me, I have been within 12 feet of wild bull moose and grizzlies and yet I am untouched, I have been shot at and I have put myself in harm's way so much... Just by existing.|12782
I work dangerous jobs, I have lived in dangerous places, and my body itself should have killed me already.|12782
I cannot even bring myself to shoot myself because it would leave a mess for whatever unlucky shmuck finds me.|12782
[BK][BK]But I am a stubborn one.|12782
If I cannot kill myself, I tell myself I will just have to make the world a better place, a place I can live in safety and be free to be myself.|12782
It's the work of a lifetime, and it hurts...|12782
But I try to help other people as best I can, and I try to be useful, and that makes me feel a little better.|12782
"'Damn, I cannot kill myself.'"""""|12782
'Oh God.|12782
"Now I really fucked up.'"""""|12782
My first attempt was when I jumped from the 2nd floor balcony when I was 6.|12782
When I woke up I screamed kill me kill me kill me.|12782
Second attempt was when I tried to smash my head against the wall at age 8.|12782
I have just hanged myself over curtail rail inthe bathroom and the shape of the rail changed and the bar dropped as I lost conciousness.|12782
I woke up on the floor flailing my arms and legs uncontrollably until I fully regained conciousness and my first thought was what was I doing lying on the floor and why is the bathroom a mess.|12782
I obviously hit my head and now with a banging pain plus my throat hurt from the unsuccessful hanging, I do not know how long it lasted because I lost conciousness.|12782
"'I guess I did not actually want to die'""[BK][BK]I was going to suicide by train, told my friends goodbye, but they somehow managed to get out of me where I was."|12782
I still do not know why I told her.|12782
Police were called, trains were stopped, I cried all the way to the hospital.|12782
I think if I ever saw those officers again I would break down in tears.|12782
[BK][BK]18 months later I still feel suicidal at times, but I have managed to twist the thoughts.|12782
What is the ultimate fuck you to a universe that made you a broken defective person that wants to violate basic instinct and self-destruct?|12782
Stay alive and show the universe what you think of fate, a giant middle finger to life itself.|12782
"I am faulty but it does not mean I do not work."""|12782
Whats odd about this post is how many people seem to act like the failed attempt means they now have to go get help.|12782
I am glad that is how they reacted, but I am curious why they do not just immediately try again.|12782
Like they seem to act not like they do not really have it in them to try again, but like getting help is the only next thing, not even the logic next thing but literally the /only/ option.|12782
"'Keep trying.'"""|12782
""""|12782
Woke up in a hospital with my parents next to me.|12782
They did not say a word but I felt so ashamed and realised how selfish I was when I saw the torment in my mom's eyes.|12782
When you have your heart ripped out by your ex its it is hard to think of the people you you will hurt when you kill yourself.|12782
[BK][BK]I had a fight with my parents and ran away all while going through a tough breakup with my ex who had already posted pics of her and her new man.|12782
My friend was out of town and on vacation so he let me stay in his empty house.|12782
I am not a smart man.|12782
First I tried using a steak knife to saw through my wrist which was a very slow blood flow so that was fail number one.|12782
I then rummaged through their cabinets eating all and any pills I could find.|12782
I was watching the movie pitch black as my mind started to fade to black.|12782
In my last moments I remember having a neverending itch on my balls and I just couldnt stop scratching.|12782
I guess my friends girlfriend decided to go grab some stuff and found a dude with pills around him passed out on the floor with my pants down.|12782
Not sure how she got me conscious but I have little memory flashes of hallucinating at her house.|12782
Her dog licking my face woke me for a few moments when I look down and see spiders and centipedes crawling all over me, it was beautiful.|12782
What really sucked was the dream (I hope is was a dream) of being in hell.|12782
It was so vivid and scary I regretted everything instantly.|12782
My parents said on the way to the hospital I was telling my dad to stop running over people on the freeway and when we were at the hospital I was speaking perfect spanish and telling the nurse I was trying to gift him that buttless robe thing they put on me.|12782
When I came to, the guilt set in though.|12782
I had covered my wrist wound with my favorite checkered sweat band after I had failed the night before and it was still on there.|12782
Im sure they knew and figured they would not make it any worse by pretending they did not know what was under it, but I have a scar to this day.|12782
[BK][BK]So I guess they pumped my stomach and yet again I had failed.|12782
I got a lot of weird attention from people afterwards.|12782
My friends seemed distant and quiet.|12782
One girl told me I suck at life so much I cant even kill myself.|12782
Honesty it never went away I still do not want to live in this shitty world but it is the people who love me who I do not want to let down.|12782
I drink til I black out most nights but I keep myself alive enough so my mommy does not worry about me.|12782
I have a decent job but I live paycheck to paycheck trying to enjoy what little I can until hopefully one day I wake up loving the world again.|12782
But I will definitely never hurt my family by going through with suicide again.|12782
What really helped was my parents acting like it never happened.|12782
I dont know if thats what the doctors recommended or something.|12782
I flat out refused any pills over the years when they diagnosed me with depression and being bipolar.|12782
I figured I would just stop being a little bitch and get through it on my own from then on.|12782
They helped me move to a new city, new highschool, new problems but there will always be problems cause life is a battle and quite the roller coaster ride.|12782
Virtual reality finally getting decent and possibly starting a colony on mars has sparked an ember of hope deep down inside me.|12782
Ive also adopted a puppy which helps a lot for anyone going through anything similar.|12782
Thanks for whoever gets to read this I know I got here late but been wanting to tell my story for some time.|12782
If not for yourself, do it for the ones who love you.|12782
[BK]|12782
About two weeks ago I failed my first suicide attempt.|12782
I took a bunch of pills and got really dizzy.|12782
My mom came home and the guilt overwhelmed me so much to the point where I told her.|12782
A small part of me was hoping I would slip into a coma or would die before making it to the hospital.|12782
When I finally threw up, I did not immediately feel regret.|12782
But idk now.|12782
I was very disapointed...|12782
I was scared of facing my family friends and girlfriend, but they all supported me and make me happy to be alive.|12782
Why will not this knife work?|12782
Panic that my girlfriend and roommate were going to find out.|12782
They did.|12782
It was Christmas morning.|12782
It was awkward,  and they were both pissed off as fuck.|12782
Next time I am picking a method with a near-zero survival rate.|12782
"'How the FUCK do I get down from here?'"""|12782
[BK]I had thrown myself off of a building roof and landed in a tree next to the building.|12782
I had gotten drunk and high in order to go through with it and that mixture and the shock of hitting the branches knocked me out for the night.|12782
Woke up three stories high in a fucking tree.|12782
"The precarious and terrifying climb down changed my mind about killing myself."""|12782
"'Well I did not do the job but my dad sure as hell will.'"""|12782
And at this point I was pretty sure of hell and knew that I would be heading there.|12782
It was after my mom died from cancer when I was 16.|12782
When I was 17 I became pregnant and learned that giving life was much easier then taking it.|12782
I went on to do adoption because my family was still in shambles and have now grown to live a beautiful life already at the age of 20.|12782
It took me a little while to realize what life is about but now that I know, I would not change any decision I have made for anything.|12782
"The glass remains half full."""|12782
I went to class, talked to my friends and even though the problem I was having was not solved I was glad I had not succeeded because my friends were there for me when my parents were not.|12782
i mostly thought 'Am i dead?|12782
where are my gods?|12782
"wake up wake up wake up....I am not dead, fuck'"", and sought better means of suicide."|12782
I attempted Inert Gas Asphyxiation but the system i used had an old gas mask with a hole in it.|12782
The small bottle of Argon was not enough to finish the job and the gas mask had a hole in it letting oxygen in.|12782
Had one hell of a headache afterwards.|12782
Went to see a therapist and I am on pills now.|12782
"I cannot wait to die still, but I am not suicidal anymore, which is nice I guess."""|12782
"I have not actually attempted, but there have been a few times that 'little voice in my head'"" was like, '""would not this be hilarious,'"" or, '""let us have this new experience,'"" or, '""X is happening right now, and it sucks, so let us just get it over with.'"""|12782
"I have a short moment of clarity after every one of those thoughts where I just think to myself, '""I am a moron.'"""""|12782
I simply woke up.|12782
There was a sense of fear as well as a sense of relief.|12782
I felt it meant something that I had not.|12782
Depression is an ugly thing.|12782
You can love people and know they love you, but it is never enough to stop you.|12782
Your sadness rationalizes your attempted demise.|12782
"There''s a documentary about people jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco called 'The Bridge'""."|12782
"One guy who survived the drop, which does not happen too often, said that he regretted the decision the minute he let go, and was really thankful that he survived."""|12782
I remember just going to sleep right afterwards even though I had a math test and things to do the next day.|12782
At the time my only regret was that I did not wear turtle necks or a hoodie or something because when my Mom saw the marks on my neck I just wanted to kill myself all over again.|12782
Looking back, she was annoying for a long time about it but it has shaped me into who I am today and I do not fault anyone but myself for the things I did a earlier in my life.|12782
I am in college now and it is time to move on.|12782
I have not had those thoughts for a long time because I know the pain it would bring my family and that I am loved here.|12782
I am sorry for anyone still hurting in this thread.|12782
My prayers and thoughts go out to you.|12782
I have to pee.|12782
Hey everyone,[BK]This is just a friendly reminder that discussion of suicide can be really difficult for those who are going through a tough time and may bring up some scary feelings.|12782
If you are feeling like you are not coping, please know that there are resources out there available to you.|12782
[BK]There are crisis services worldwide that are trained to provide support.|12782
These centres are designed to give temporary relief from feelings that are overwhelming you and while they are unlikely to fix any underlying problems, can help you get through a tough hour/night/week.|12782
[BK]Otherwise, if you feel like you may be suffering from a mental illness or your thoughts/feelings are making it hard to cope, I strongly recommend trying to find an appropriate professional in your area.|12782
Just as you would see a doctor when you are sick, you deserve to take care of your mental health.|12782
[BK]Stay safe people.|12782
Now, I did not actually ATTEMPT suicide, but I DID have a plan and was going to carry it out.|12782
I had the means to and I set a date.|12782
What I like to consider a miracle occurred.|12782
"I had been severely depressed and cut off contact with a lot of my friends to 'soften the blow'"", so to speak."|12782
"Out of nowhere one of those friends contacted me on Facebook, and I still remember what he said to me: '""Hey."|12782
I feel that we should talk sometime.|12782
I feel concerned with you and I just want to check in on you.|12782
"If you need help with anything, I will be open to talk.'"""|12782
Let''s just say that the way I ended our friendship had been harsh, so I kind of wondered why he was suddenly reaching out to me.|12782
I decided fuck it, you only live once (and that I only had a few hours left to live at that point), and ended up messaging him back.|12782
We talked on Skype for several hours.|12782
I made no mention of the suicide and probably acted pretty normal, but I suspect he knew something was going on (based on his message).|12782
"[BK][BK]Now, I needed that to preface what my first thought was after I ended the Skype call: '""Oh my God."|12782
I cannot kill myself tonight.|12782
He''ll have to live with that forever.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I decided to postpone the date."|12782
"That date has come and gone, and I am still here."""|12782
Oh Thank God I did not let booze take me out.|12782
How am I going to deal with the repercussions?|12782
Physically, spiritually, mentally, emotionally I am spent.|12782
Where is my strength going to come from?|12782
I have none what the fuck am I going to do?|12782
Fuck.|12782
Now I have to explain this to my mom.|12782
That's how she found out I was gay.|12782
I wish my mom would not have called me.|12782
I am fairly happy right now but sometimes it still gets rough for me and I wish I would have been able to finish before she almost found me.|12782
I will never be able to erase that experience from my memory.|12782
I completely understand why some people commit suicide but I do not wish it upon anyone.|12782
The pain and grief I would cause my mom and dad if I had succeeded.|12782
"'Not this again'"" and then I thought about the movie Groundhogs Day."|12782
[BK][BK]I still wish I were dead.|12782
The only reason I have not killed myself is because I had a nightmare that my Dad died and I woke up the next day feeling even more awful than my normal state.|12782
I would not want to do that to anyone.|12782
"Hopefully I will get cancer and die slowly so it doens''t really come as a surprise to anyone."""|12782
All this moral bullshit in this thread is disgusting.|12782

"Now I am going to jail and have to explain this to everyone.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]I told a sort of half lie and still have never told anyone the truth.|12782
The weird thing for me is that even though I was totally wasted, and severely concussed, I remember the whole thing vividly in slow motion.|12782
"Also, I never did go to jail, but I did go to the hospital, and they kept me there for about a day because I told the officers I was suicidal."""|12782
My first thought after waking up (which shouldnt have happened) was to try it again and finish it.|12782
I had swallowed an immense amount of pills and alcohol the night before, and when I woke up I could barely stumble out of bed.|12782
I went to the bathroom to throw up, and before I knew it I had grabbed a shaving razor.|12782
Tried to pull the small dinky blade out and was slicing at my wrist.|12782
"[BK][BK]It finally kicked in, 'What in gods name am I doing?!'"""|12782
For one, it hurt so badly and wasnt doing a damn thing.|12782
And secondly, there was a panicked voice in my head telling me to stop, to just call anyone.|12782
[BK][BK]I dont remember dialing my boss at work, but I apparently did and told her through tears that I would not be coming in.|12782
Then to 911.|12782
[BK][BK]I had a roommate at the time that was completely unaware that any of this was happening.|12782
He had run out to get something for breakfast and was coming home when the first responders and police shows up.|12782
I remember them coming up the front stairs slowly, hands on their guns (they didnt know what sort of mental state I was in).|12782
They got me in cuffs and got me to the police car.|12782
I tried my best not to make eye contact with my room mate, but it happened.|12782
[BK][BK]I was cooperative, never once resisted.|12782
I was just ashamed of myself.|12782
Why did I call anyone before it got this bad?|12782
Why did I talk to my room mate, my best friend?|12782
My family?|12782
[BK][BK]I am very happy to say that I received (and continue to receive) great treatment.|12782
Lots of talk therapy, proper medication, many tools to help deal with the depression.|12782
Today I still deal with it, but I know i have people to turn to, thing I can do to regain control before it gets anyone near as bad as it was.|12782

[BK][BK]For me, I was not originally planning on trying to kill myself.|12782
I had spent the better part of 4 years having a parental figure tell me that I was worthless and that I would never amount to anything.|12782
Of course, when you first hear it, you immediately dismiss it; after awhile, however, you start to believe it.|12782
It was a weight that I could not shake.|12782
[BK][BK]I started cutting not to kill myself, but rather to dull the mental/emotional pain I was going through.|12782
I had thought about suicide, but I was determined that if I was going that route that I would just drink a cup of bleach and be done with life.|12782
[BK][BK]The saddest part was that when my dad found out, he proceeded to yell at me.|12782
That was when I knew that I needed to change my life.|12782

Things have not been easy, but I am managing my life.|12782
I have at least proven that I am not worthless, and have found things in life to help keep me on the healing track.|12782

"**"""|12782
How did I get here?|12782
[BK][BK]Last memory was on the bathroom floor, drunk, in a last moment of regret I tried, and failed, to vomit up the pills.|12782
I could not lift myself from the floor, everything felt so heavy I could not move ...blacked out in the bathroom.|12782
Woke up to my roommates cat licking me in the face, in my own bed.|12782
None of my roommates mentioned anything, but they must have found me and carried me to my bed thinking I had just been too drunk.|12782
We never talked about it.|12782
I took 34 paracetamol tablets, had a glass of orange juice, and went to bed hoping to not wake up around about 10pm, of course I did not realize at the time how long and painful death by liver failure is, I woke up around 6am with what I can only describe as the worst pain I had ever felt in my abdomen, I stumbled to the toilet and proceed to vomit for the next hour, I woke my parents up due to the vomiting and they demanded to know what was up because I was puking not sick but bright yellow bile, I told them the truth and I was ashamed, I felt relief I guess that all my bottled feelings were out in the open, it was just after a rough breakup and my life just kept tumbling down hill, this was in November 2015 when I attempted it, I spent the next week and a half on an infusion and vomiting any food or drink straight back up after an hour, that beeping noise is one I will never get out my head, to say the least the whole experience was trans-formative for me, I had a week on a ward to think about life and where I went from there, ontop of that for the first time in a long time I no longer felt alone, my friends and family came in to rally around me and pick me up from the dirt and bring me in from the cold, then just after christmas I met a wonderful new girlfriend and I never knew life could get this good, things have turned around, to anyone whose thinking about it, reach out to those around you, they are not your enemies they can help!|12782
as cliche as this sounds, it gets fucking better!|12782
[BK][BK]another piece of advice do not let others drag you down and make you feel like your life is worthless whoever they may be, my case was my ex and her new boyfriend who harassed me while I was in hospital and tried to drag me through the dirt, fuck em!|12782
Bipolar, been suicidal my whole adult life.|12782
Multiple attempts on my own life, I cannot even count the number of times I have sat with a razor to my wrist or my neck in a noose.|12782
I am not even sure if the numbering of these is even close, but these are the big significant attempts that pop to mind.|12782
I have tried hanging myself, overdosing, alcohol poisoning, falling from some height, stepping into traffic....|12782
I am not very successful at dying.|12782

Damnit why did not this just work I suck at overdosing.|12782

I was really apathetic.|12782

No will to have thoughts.|12782
No will to change anything.|12782

"'Fuck, better go shopping then'"""""|12782
I tried to overdose.|12782
When I came to, it felt like no more than an instant had passed, when really it had been hours.|12782
I struggled to breathe for a while, and thought about the experience.|12782
I realized there was no relief here, only oblivion.|12782
Death is not a rest.|12782
It's nothing, total nothingness, ceasing to exist.|12782
It's the worst thing that can happen to you, much worse than being in pain.|12782
It's not being at all.|12782
It's terrifying.|12782
I was twenty.|12782
I waited until my mom went to walk our dog and drove her car into our garage and left it running.|12782
After an amount of time that I do not really know, I fell asleep thinking this was it.|12782
[BK] [BK]I woke up a little while later, realized I was a dumbass and that I was doing this over a girl, and turned off the car.|12782
I opened the garage and looked outside.|12782
I felt like shit.|12782
[BK][BK]When I looked out, the older couple that lived in the house across the road waved at me.|12782
I waved back and that is the first clear thought I had during that entire situation and it will stick with me forever.|12782
"'How odd is it that someone you have known for twenty years could have just been in enough pain to do something like that seconds earlier, and they wave at you and smile.'"""|12782
I went back inside, burnt the letters I had written, and went back about my day like nothing had happened.|12782
[BK][BK]A year later I had a full breakdown and finally told my parents.|12782
I was immediately put in a home.|12782
I have been trying to come back from it ever since.|12782
I had a thought one day that maybe I did die, maybe this was some weird Jacob''s Ladder/Owl Creek thing and all of this is in my mind.|12782
"After suffering for months over this I said this to a friend of mine and all she said back was '""would it matter if it were?'"""|12782
[BK][BK]I guess not.|12782
"But it is still scary to think about. """|12782
I tried a couple times.|12782
Once when I was 15, I tried to hang myself by tying myself to a tree.|12782
But I chickened out at the last minute.|12782
Another time I tried to jump off a bridge but same thing happened.|12782
The time I came closest was with pills.|12782
I took 2 whole bottles of Tylenol and Xanax and tried to go to sleep and not wake up again.|12782
[BK][BK]It took about 5 minutes for me to realize that this was a bad idea, not only because killing myself would be a terrible loss but because ODing on pain pills is, ironically, an excruciatingly painful way to die.|12782
I was in college at the time and I went to my school's free clinic, next thing you know I was being carried off in an ambulance and they were pumping my stomach and making me swallow liquid charcoal so it would not stick to my liver.|12782
I was in the hospital for a week, first in the ER, then in a psychiatric facility.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not really remember what I was thinking about after that, other than the fact that some of my friends came 2 towns over to see me as soon as they found out what happened.|12782
Some of them did not even have cars so they had to walk or take the bus (and this was in New England in mid-January, it was fucking cold out).|12782
My dad came from about 2 hours away and gave me a couple books that I really liked to read.|12782
The one thing that really stuck with me was how much people cared about me and how much they did not want me to die.|12782
I decided life was worth living and that I could not end it when I was at such a young age.|12782
I realized how many people loved me and I wanted to be able to give it back any way I could.|12782
I woke up after being unconscious for 3 days|12782
fuck why did i try that|12782
"'Fuck, that hurts'"""""|12782
Fuck...|12782
"'ugh...I guess I am invincible'"" and then psych ward."""|12782
"'Well shit, I am still here'""[BK][BK]I just want to die."|12782

When I was a sophmore in high school I overdosed between midnight and 3am.|12782
I was not afraid of bullies or the pressure to do well, I was just tired of the rat race and did not feel like doing it anymore.|12782
I was completely disenchanted.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up, in time to catch the bus, and I kicked into autopilot.|12782
My primary thought was 'where is my fucking iPod?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I ended up passing out in one of the hallways of my school."|12782
I do not know who found me.|12782
I vaguely remember being on a gurney in the nurse''s office and the nurse ''tsk tsk''ing me.|12782
[BK][BK]In the ER they pumped my stomach.|12782
I remember fighting, biting the charcoal tube and a nurse holding my face still so hard she bruised my face.|12782
They ended up shoving a tube down my nose, which bled like crazy.|12782
[BK][BK]The next thing I remember the ambulance ride to psych.|12782
I became fully conscious then and had what I still consider to be the worst panic attack of my life.|12782
I hyperventilated for the solid hour and a half ride to the bigger hospital.|12782
The paramedic who rode in the back with me, strapped me to the gurney and berated me the whole ride.|12782
She told me I was being dramatic and obviously faking the panic attack, though I could hear my heart monitor going nuts.|12782
[BK][BK]The nurses in psych were more sympathetic and one of them gave me a cordless phone to call my then girlfriend.it turns out that was against a bunch of rules bc I was a minor and the nurse got in trouble.|12782
[BK][BK] I was released into my parents care and sat through the longest, quietest, most awkward car ride home.|12782
My siblings met me at the door and the whole bizarre scene was like a living wake.|12782
Later that week my mother literally threw the medical bills in my face.|12782
"[BK]"""|12782
I had been drugged pretty bad, aside from the pills and whine I took they must have given me more sedatives and I had slept for an entire day.|12782
When I recouperated I was still pretty dull and even now I cannot remember the conversation I had with my shrink.|12782
Soon after I was in the car with my parents, heading out of town.|12782
As we reached the destination (now I clearly remembered what I was thinking): 'Is that... is that the local mental asylum?|12782

It has been 17 years since that day, but I view it as my lowest point and I have not been that far down since even though I still struggle with depression.|12782

That will leave a mark.|12782

"It is all about self-compassion."""|12782
> Hell that did hurt a lot.|12782
Should have used a much thicker cable|12782
a few years ago i took a lot of drugs and drank heavily, and then i jumped off a bridge.|12782
i landed chest first onto a metal guard rail about 30ft down, and i do not remember anything until i woke up in the hospital.|12782
i had all kinds of tubes, iv's, and whatnot coming out of me, and i could not move without extreme pain.|12782
i collapsed my lungs, broke my ribs, lacerated my liver, and had a concussion, but i was still alive.|12782
the first thing i remember is just being very confused and disoriented, and i had to ask a nurse where i was and what happened.|12782
they explained what i had done to myself, and then it all kinda came back.|12782
honestly, i did not feel much of anything after i woke up (excluding pain).|12782
i did not feel guilt, regret, or anything.|12782
i just felt numb.|12782
it did not work, and i was okay with that, but i do not remember feeling saved, or especially happy one way or another.|12782
i was in the hospital for almost a week, and the best part about it was all my friends and family coming to see me.|12782
it made me happy to see how much they cared, but i still never had an epiphany from it.|12782
I am glad I am alive today, but i would not say it is because of the failed attempt.|12782
i did not learn or gain anything from it.|12782
it just hurt a lot.|12782
I got to a point in my life where I would basically lost everything that was important to me, and I was in a lot of pain almost every day.|12782
And I was a at a point where no matter what I did, even if I succeeded one day, it would not last because problems from my past would come back to haunt me inevitably.|12782
I basically did not see a point in going on.|12782
[BK][BK]Because of the chronic pain I was in, I had a prescription for Tylenol 3s, a whole bottle of them.|12782
My roommate was out of town for the week, but he told me he would wanted me gone by the time he got back.|12782
It just was not'' working out.|12782
So I told him, 'Yeah.|12782
"I will not be here anymore when you get back'""."|12782
[BK][BK]So there I was, with my bottle of painkillers, no place to live, no future, no hope, and in really bad pain to boot.|12782
I just laid in bed all morning the first day I was alone.|12782
The pills were on the shelf.|12782
I was thinking about how my loved ones would be sad if I was gone, maybe even devastated, but they would get over it.|12782
Life goes on.|12782
And at least I would not be in pain anymore.|12782
And at least I would not have to deal with how pointless life was.|12782
[BK][BK]I never ended up doing it though.|12782
Instead, I reached out to my dad and told him what I was going through.|12782
He drove over and picked me up.|12782
He did not even talk to me about it.|12782
No lectures or anything.|12782
He just started working on helping me find a new place to live.|12782
Sometimes having only one less thing to worry about is enough relief to help you go on another day.|12782
Just fix one little problem.|12782
It makes you feel a little better.|12782
[BK][BK]Though I did not actually, physically make the attempt, I still consider myself a survivor.|12782
I was pretty damn close.|12782
I even had the plan, the means, and the opportunity.|12782
But I reached out instead.|12782
I do not even know why I did.|12782
There was really no reason not to do it.|12782
But when I went to bed that night, the last thought in my head was that, yeah, life is shitty and miserable.|12782
But the great people out there who genuinely care and treat you decently no matter what make it worth the trouble, and the little sparks of joy in the darkness are as beautiful as stars.|12782
[BK][BK]I decided to become one of those kinds of people.|12782
Life might not ever get better.|12782
My situation is still only marginally improved.|12782
"But at least I can make other people''s days a little better, and maybe give them a little bit of that feeling of overwhelming gratitude I felt when my dad was there for me in my darkest hour. """|12782

I do not think anyway.|12782
He heard voices in his head that told him to do it.|12782
[BK][BK]I was young at the time, me and my Dad were basically lodgers in this guys house.|12782
[BK][BK]My Dad saved him the first 2 times, by pure luck.|12782
I was there for the second one, he had tried to hang himself.|12782
Once he woke up, he told us that the voices were angry that he did not get it right.|12782
[BK][BK]I was too young to understand at the time, but now I realise how awful it must be.|12782
The first thing you hear after waking up is scolding from your own head, insults you cannot block out.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not have too many details, sonce my father dose not like to talk about it.|12782
[BK][BK]In his life, he was a great guy.|12782
Amazing sense of humor, great at cooking and really nice in general.|12782
He had 2 children that he left behind.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not know why he did not seek help, I do not know many things on this topic.|12782
[BK][BK]But for anyone feeling like suicide, look for help.|12782
Even if you do not want it, do it for your loved ones, your freinds.|12782
Even your pets.|12782
Somone always loves you, but it can just be hidden.|12782
"'Who the fuck is this guy in my room?'"""|12782
[BK][BK]It was the EMT.|12782
He left bruises on my arm when he led me out to the ambulance.|12782
I could see all my neighbors outside to see what was going on.|12782
My second coherent thought was absolute shame and humiliation.|12782
But I also did not care much because I was still really groggy and really high on the pills I would taken.|12782
Was hoping it had still work in the ambulance but did not figure that was likely.|12782
Turns out what I would taken was not easy to OD on and they kept me fairly alert on the trip.|12782
No stomach pumping just charcoal.|12782
Worst thing I have ever had to drink and it left my stomach fucked up for days.|12782
Relief was not something I felt.|12782
My dad of course told everyone what I would done.|12782
So I had to live all that humiliation and shame again after I got out of the psych ward.|12782
Living after attempted suicide is not as bad as the moments leading up to it but it is pretty fucking close.|12782

The most recent time, he admitted it to my mom but swore her to secrecy and does not know that I know.|12782
He's 32 now and I do not know how to help him.|12782

What can I say to him?|12782
How do I trick him into looking on the bright side?|12782
Severe depression runs in my family.|12782
My grandmother survived the Holocaust and lived to be 93, but wanted to die every day for the last 10 years of her life and talked about it constantly.|12782
Suicide and ending everything has been a theme in my family my whole life, including from my dad, until he passed from complications due to cancer.|12782
I do not know how to help us move past the negativity.|12782
It scares me.|12782
I love my family.|12782
"I was about 14, and when I woke up in a lake of vomit, not able to move, I thought, 'See you cannot even do that right.'"""|12782
Then I thought, what if it was more extreme and I survived but was permanently paralyzed and had to be imprisoned in my own body with my depression and my abusive family forever, and what if I could not even talk?|12782
So I just wait for death instead, like everyone else- but it also gives me anxiety, knowing it is coming.|12782
I drowned once, at 17, too- I know what death is like, I can wait.|12782
I also know, you cannot ask forgiveness for a murder you committed on yourself.|12782
There is a purgatory for suicides.|12782
Just do not do it.|12782
Time is an illusion.|12782
Everything shall pass, even you, when you are supposed to.|12782
Plus, afterward, I had my stomach pumped at the hospital, and when I got home, the beating of my life from my mom for putting her through that.|12782
"I then moved out at 15, and to be completely honest, I did try a couple more times after the first time- but after drowning/dying at 17, briefly, it gave me a new outlook on everything. """|12782
'Fine.|12782
One more year.|12782
"Then it will be time.'"""""|12782
I have not attempted myself, but I had a very important person to me who committed suicide.|12782
"Within hours of the attempt, before she was even declared brain dead, everyone in town knew and was already posting 'RIP'"" statuses on Facebook."|12782
Her death was devastating for me, and I had hoped that she would pull through, but it got to the point that even I eventually thought it would be better for her - could you imagine waking up to a world who had accepted your death?|12782
"To people talking about '""a good person throwing away their life'"" when you were unsuccessful?"|12782
"[BK][BK]I like to think that had she survived it would have been that '""thank god'"" moment that so many other people described."|12782
"But I am convinced that even if it had been, the towns reaction would have quickly turned the thought back to disappointment. """|12782
"'hmmm'"""""|12782
"'Fuck, I really need some sleep.'"""""|12782
Not my time.|12782
Why did I do that?|12782

Interesting this is the first topic I have read here after just joining tonight.|12782
I think about doing it a lot.|12782
It seems one shit thing happens after another.|12782
It's been good to read your comments.|12782

I must have woken up in the wee hours because there was nobody else around (after trying to OD) and I was a bit affected by the drugs - I was just walking around the house confused and thought I might have become a ghost.|12782
Follow the mod he speaks truth|12782
I tried choking myself to death with an electrical cord.|12782
I actually asked someone to kill me.|12782
There was no where for me to hang myself and i know if i tried asphyxiation, i could relax when i passed out and survive.|12782
So he actually agreed to it.|12782
He tried killing me with an electrical cord (long story about the agreement) and i just remember waking up, he was still there, and it took forever to come to.|12782
When he realized i was still breathing i heard him calling my name and i just started crying, mixed emotions of relief, sadness, failure, just a lot of mixed emotions, every time i tried (pills, gun to my temple, femoral artery).|12782
I popped three discs, nearly crushed my windpipe, and had terrible welts.|12782
My fucking boss just thought i was kinky.|12782
[BK][BK]I finally got locked up in the psych ward after getting 20 stitches on an attempt on my femoral artery.|12782
I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.|12782
I am on auxiliary medication and go through intense therapy.|12782
Suicidal ideations will always be there,  BPD kills 1 in 10 sufferers, but I am doing a lot better.|12782
The most recent time was last Thanksgiving.|12782
My fiancée and I had been struggling with a lot of debt, plus we both have severe depression and anxiety disorders.|12782
Her father had recently passed and she had tried to kill herself in the shower, I Found her in the tub and her mother and I took her to the hospital.|12782
While she was there the pressure from feeling like I was a failure for not being able to alleviate her pain, being in a new state with no family or friends to support me, as well as all the stress from hiding the fact that I am bisexual from everyone I Know for most of my life hit a boiling point and I cut my arms pretty bad.|12782
As I was starting to pass out I realized that I wanted nothing more than to spend my life with this woman and that if I did in fact kill myself she would most likely succeed on her next attempt.|12782
I reached over for my phone and was able to call our room mate who called the paramedics.|12782
Things are still rough financially but the scare was enough for me to be honest about my feelings and identity with everyone.|12782
Ultimately my life has been far better because of my decision to make that call.|12782
My fiancée and I are closer and more honest than ever and overall life is in fact getting better, despite the fact that it sounds like a cliche to say so.|12782
Damn, this thread is somehow so sad and inspiring at the same time.|12782
It really puts my problems in perspective!|12782
I hope you people stay strong.|12782
As the strong sister who does not cry nor be lovey dovey, seeing my lil sister after her suicide attempt made me feel so worthless & sad.|12782
Selfish?|12782
Yea probably but why are not we the ones who have felt pride & heart bursting love to see you accomplish things not enough to make you want to live?|12782
I hate feeling helpless when it comes to my younger sibs!|12782
"'Well fuck, looks like imma have to try again. '"""|12782
[BK][BK]I was super depressed at the time.|12782

"I was in such a dark place that I could only think about a more effective way for my next go round. """|12782
"'Shit, I cannot even do this right!'"""|12782
Then proceeded to spend the next 24 hours in a bathroom.|12782
My family to this day, still does not know what happened they just thought I was sick.|12782
Normally I am quiet about these type of things, so it takes a bit for anyone to realize what is going on but when they do; it is the worst.|12782

I laid there for almost a whole two hours before I heard screaming and banging on my door.|12782
Its almost as if I was concentrating so hard on dying after drinking all the Nyquil and taking all the Tylenol that I just went numb and couldnt hear anything other than my thoughts; I couldnt hear my mom banging on my door to my bedroom and screaming at me to open the door.|12782
I took amost two hours, or felt like that, until I came back to consciousness, got up and opened the door.|12782
That was aslmost 7 years ago.|12782
[BK][BK]Now im 20 years old and have been struggling pretty hardcore with depression and anxiety for a good 8 years.|12782
At first I thought I was just a shy kid who didnt want to do much other than play K''nex by myself and listen to music that made me sad, I just thought that was just who I was.|12782
That turned into staying home from school because I didnt think I was good enough to go to a 20K per year school, or participate in sports because I wasnt good enough, or even be with my family because I thought I was a burden.|12782
It slowly got worse and I tried to end everything 5 more times after that, for a total of 6 attempted suicides before the age of 21.|12782

My first thoughts were not so much words, but more an overwhelming feel of despair.|12782
I had failed.|12782
I cried in that hospital bed for hours hooked up to an IV drip and just wished I had had the courage to have not told anyone, to have disappeared like a flame ebbing out on a melted candle.|12782
An old friend brought me to the hospital and stayed by my side for the entirety of my stay, and as much as I love him for doing that for me and as selfish and stupid as it is, I still want to sleep forever.|12782

I have not myself attempted suicide but my friend who I spent and hour performing CPR on, when he first woke in the hospital he told me that he hated me for saving his life.|12782
I have not spoken to him since but his mother stays in contact with me.|12782
I know I did the right thing but I feel terrible about it and from this experience I myself became very depressed and suffer still from it.|12782
Ouch, hit a stoby pole at 170kph, broke a leg, that shit fucking hurts.|12782
Then i noticed the fire and thought fuck no fires worse someone put that shit out|12782
Hello, I realize I am a bit late here for this comment to get noticed but I decided to share my story anyways.|12782
I moved from Sweden to Spain when I was a young lad.|12782
The bullying started already in my first year I went to school there but it escalated horribly during 6th to 9th grade.|12782
Somewhere around 7th grade I was at my lowest, mentally speaking.|12782
I was the weird Swede, under-performing in math and Spanish classes and I was small in stature.|12782
The kids and even the teachers picked on me every day.|12782
One time, my classmate pushed my neck so hard, he dislocate my neck right in front of my teacher.|12782
The teacher saw the whole thing but told my parents the same day that I hurt myself in my sleep.|12782
I just had it.|12782
I had to wear a neck-stabilizer (what is it called again?)|12782
for a month.|12782
It was so embarrassing.|12782
I was sad and angry and I felt so alone.|12782
I got no support from nobody.|12782
I decided to jump off the 9th floor later that day (where I lived back then).|12782
I always pondered on suicide since I moved to Spain, sitting on the window ledge contemplating if I would feel relief by jumping.|12782
However, that day I was determined.|12782
I came home, ate my most hated meal (lentil-soup) and went to my room.|12782
I was convinced life was against me.|12782
I was angry, sad and hated everything.|12782
I hated Spain, my parents, my sister, my classmates, you name it.|12782
I went to the window, opened it and stood on the ledge.|12782
I was so filled with anger and hate I never stopped to think, I just took one big step outside but suddenly my sister pulled me in.|12782
She said nothing during this and ran to mom to tell her what I was doing.|12782
I was sitting on the floor and my family members stood around me.|12782
I had no idea what my parents where telling me as I was so consumed by my emotions.|12782
I had one thing clear in my mind, though...|12782
I wanted to kill myself but not in front of my sister.|12782
"[BK][BK]I was going to try again soon after, when my sister would go off to a camp or event of some sort but my parents 'fixed'"" the window so I could not open it and attempt to jump again."|12782
Sometimes I get flashbacks from this day and I remember this in detail.|12782
I get a clump in my throat thinking about this day, still.|12782
[BK][BK]A year passed, the bullying continued but my parents told me I may go back to Sweden the year after if I get passing grades.|12782
So I decided to stay alive because I had hope that Sweden could give me back the happiness and hope I lost.|12782
This might sound like a cliché but when I started high-school in Sweden, all my sadness was gone.|12782
I felt free.|12782
My grades where doing better than ever, I had good friends and was never bullied.|12782
[BK][BK]I am glad to be alive.|12782
I have done some traveling, seen beautiful places and got myself a wife from Canada, who is my everything.|12782
"[BK][BK]TL;DR: My first conscious thought was to try to jump again from the 9th floor but not in front of my sister"""|12782
"'Ugh, not again...'"" as I wake up to paramedics stripping me down after administering Narcan (I attempted to overdose on a combination of heroin, xanax and alcohol)."""|12782
It''s hard to pin down exactly what my first thought was because I still had Xanax in my system for about two days afterwards, so I was kind of all an emotional mess even once I was fully conscious .|12782
"But when I registered where I was, noted all the tubes coming out of me, and saw all four of my parents sitting around me, I realized 'holy shit, I need to get some help.'"""|12782

I woke up in the hospital, very loopy cause I had been under for several days.|12782
"First words out of my mouth were: 'someone get me a fucking cigarette.'"""""|12782
I am glad you are still here too.|12782
I was in a long distance relationship with a girl I met on MySpace.|12782
Didn't work out but that is not important.|12782
[BK][BK]One of her friends would call me to talk about her troubles every once in a while.|12782
She had a boyfriend in the UK (we live in the US).|12782
She was kind of nuts.|12782
Didn't allow him to have any friends who were girls.|12782
Stuff like that.|12782
Although I do not know how she mediated it since he lived across the pond.|12782
I played halo with I am online a couple of times.|12782
He was really nice.|12782
It did not work out with them though.|12782
That's when things got bad.|12782
[BK][BK]She was already pretty depressed.|12782
She cut her self ect...|12782
But him breaking up with her sent her over the edge.|12782
And since I was the only person she really talked to, she latched onto me.|12782
[BK][BK]She called me one night and calmly told me that she was going to kill herself while I was on the phone with her.|12782
She claimed to have fallen in love with me, and if I did not love her back, she would swallow as many pills that she could find.|12782
So I did the only sensible thing I could think of.|12782
I told her I loved her, which was a lie.|12782
[BK][BK]But that did not stop her.|12782
A couple days later she called me and told me she had went through with it.|12782
That as we spoke she was probably dying.|12782
I managed to convince her to let me call a suicide hotline for her.|12782
The lady on the phone told me to call 911.|12782
Only problem was I did not know where to tell them to go.|12782
I lived in Florida, she lived in Ohio.|12782
And she was not calling anyone.|12782
Finally I got her mom on the phone and she took it from there.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not really know how she turned out after that.|12782
I broke contact with her because I could not handle being friends with her anymore.|12782
It was too much for a 14 year old to deal with.|12782
I do hope she is ok now.|12782
[BK][BK]She did call me my senior year and threaten to sabotage my relationship with my then girl friend (now wife).|12782
I told her off and she has not called me since.|12782
[BK][BK]I feel like she had some mental issues besides depression.|12782
I hope she got help.|12782
[BK][BK]I know this is not exactly what you asked about OP.|12782
But I felt like it was relevant.|12782
[BK][BK]If any young people here have friends that are thinking about suicide.|12782
Tell someone please.|12782
[BK][BK]|12782
'Fuck I am in hospital..why?|12782
'[BK][BK]Took me a while to remember I would overdosed, my stomach hurt so bad I thought I had appendicitis|12782
"'I cannot leave my dad.'"""|12782
The overwhelming guilt of leaving my father with my mom hit me pretty hard, but it is pretty much a temporary life extension.|12782
I think once my parents eventually pass on, I am gonna do it.|12782
"It''ll be nice."""|12782
I just cried, harder than I have in my entire life.|12782
I just wanted to be done but I was convinced that life was just trying to continue screwing me.|12782
[BK][BK]I swallowed every damn pill I owned (a wide variety due to being medicated for bipolar, depression, anxiety and a few other random meds) but a friend found me slumped against a basement wall covered in my own vomit.|12782
He took me to the hospital and they immediately pumped my stomach.|12782
When I woke up I was devastated.|12782
I was mad at my friend for not letting me die, but more so I was mad at myself.|12782
All I could think was how could I have been so stupid, I was already planning how my next (and final) attempt would go, how I would make sure I never had to walk this planet again.|12782
I thought surely nobody on this planet was drowning in pain and misery the way I was.|12782
Until I saw my mom crying.|12782
[BK][BK]That's when it all shifted, my perspective became a little bit more clear all at once.|12782
The pain I was feeling?|12782
It was nothing compared to the pain she was having to deal with.|12782
Seeing her youngest daughter laid up in a hospital bed because she tried to kill herself.|12782
I knew from the way she looked at me (but never at my face) that I would caused her more pain than I ever actually experienced.|12782
[BK][BK]I vowed to never do that to my mom again.|12782
After a stint In a mental hospital for the suicide, pill problem and eating disorder I spent months trying to win my mom back.|12782
Eventually her hugs became a little bit tighter, she started laughing again, and it was all worth it.|12782
I lapsed a few times with the pill problem and the eating disorder but that was it for me, I was done with trying to be done with life.|12782
I wanted her to be proud of her little girl and feel she did not fail.|12782
[BK][BK]Unfortunately she passed away while I was still battling the eating disorder, but she did know I was on the final road to recovery.|12782
It's been 8.5 years since my suicide attempt, and even with my mom being gone I am never looking back because who i was is who I never want to be again.|12782
Disappointment, followed closely by hangover.|12782
I had knocked back a few shots of gin, taken almost two dozen vicodin, and then chugged another pint of straight gin.|12782
Judging from the state I woke up in, I rejected the gin and barfed everything back up before passing out on my floor.|12782
There was no joy at being alive, no gratitude that I did not drown in vomit, no excitement at a second chance; I woke up face down in a pool of puke with one of the worst hangovers of my life and the knowledge that not only did I feel like a total failure at life, I was enough of one that I I could not even opt out.|12782
I never got the stain completely out of the carpet and I never told a soul for about ten years.|12782
I wish I could say that things have gotten better and I now have a multitude of reasons why life is beautiful and I am glad to still be here, but despite meds and therapy I still wish pretty regularly that I would succeeded.|12782
Sometimes I wonder if maybe I actually did, and that a lifetime of depression and hiding behind a mask of humor and optimism is the purgatory I have been sentenced to for taking my own life.|12782
At age 19 one feb or mars night i decided to hang myself.|12782
Tied a cord into a noose, put it over a door and closed it, i hade a pair of wireless headphones on repeating a certain song.|12782
I put a chair next to the door with the back faced away from the door.|12782
I kind of crouched down on the chair enough for the cord to cut blood flow to my head.|12782
[BK][BK]Suddenly the sound faded out into silence, i had passed out.|12782
Just as it faded out it began returning, a sharp pain began pulsating from the hip on my left sided, it took a while for me to realise i was lying on the floor, the room was pitch black, i got up and checked a digital clock i had in my room, some 20 minutes has passed since i had checked it just before passing out.|12782
Im guesssing that most of those 20 min was spent passed out on the floor.|12782
Looking at the cord and door i could see that it most likely had been damaged from the friction caused between cord and edge of the door when my body went into spasms.|12782
I was fucked up, kind of highish for quite a while after the incident and mostly confused.|12782
In this state i managed to break contact with a person affecting me in a very negative way though.|12782
'Well, I guess its supposed to hurt.|12782
"'""[BK]I was 16 and Came home after a long Monday of being bullied, finally decidedIi was not going though another week of the shit."|12782
Went to my shed and grabbed my dads thickest rope looked for ways to hang all over the house until I finally settled on the ceiling fan structure in my room.|12782
Probably looped the rope around 4 times until there was just enough to fit my head/neck inside.|12782
I stood on the chair watching cars drive by though the window and with a blank moment I just slowly tipped the chair out of reach.|12782
It hurt like hell.|12782
I thought maybe I was doing it wrong, But then again my body just wanted to relax and take the pain.|12782
I kept repeating to myself its supposed to hurt  I do not know how long I initially hung there until I decided I did not want to do it anymore.|12782
I ended up scratching the rope so badly my nails chipped off at the base and everything went blurry, not black i just could not see or hear.|12782
Just like that I woke up in the hospital strapped to the bed and unable to speak.|12782
The look on my baby brothers face seeing me strapped up with the same bloody shirt and neck is what haunts me (and keeps me alive today).|12782
"No one should have to explain to him what I tried to do."""|12782
 I was in a hospital and I cannot recall a single thought only because I had so many.|12782
I was dehydrated, sleep deprived, had not eaten in days, and had a lot of pills.|12782
[BK][BK]I was coming in and out of reality.|12782
Life itself felt like a dream and I was having trouble staying conscious even though I was fully awake.|12782
I heard voices in my mind so loud that they were indistinguishable from real voices.|12782
[BK][BK]All I really kept thinking was I failed.|12782
And now I failed even harder than before.|12782
[BK][BK]Anxiety and depression are a devastating combination.|12782

When I was 16, I slit my wrists.|12782
I did not work out so 6 weeks later I OD''d on medications and spent a couple days in ICU.|12782
When I came out, my family did not deal well with me and sent me back into a mental institution.|12782
I felt guilty after I had done it.|12782
"Not because I did not succeed but because of the pain I caused my little brother and the guilt he felt from not being able to 'save me'"" himself."""|12782
I woke up after my attempted overdose and could not tell if I was still alive or not.|12782
I had a migraine and vomited a lot, and then went to school in the morning as though nothing had happened.|12782
It's been five years and I can finally honestly say I am ok, even if I am only 90% sure that this is all real.|12782
One time I tried very hard to commit suicide.|12782
After a while, I realised that what I had tried was not going to work and I did not have the energy left to do something that would work.|12782
So I called the ambulance.|12782
I think that I first thought something like 'Oh man, that happened.|12782
"I guess I gotta figure out where to go from here'""."|12782
I was not grateful that I did not die, but I also accepted and was ok that I would continue to live.|12782
[BK][BK]That was almost 4 years ago, I have been sober since then, and my life has been super awesome and beautiful.|12782
I am grateful I did not die, and for people struggling, my message to you is this:[BK][BK]Whatever is happening, there is a way to turn it around.|12782
"You may feel like shit now, but can create a beautiful life and give something precious back to the world if you try hard enough."""|12782
"'Fuck'""[BK][BK]I knew I was in for a world of hurt on top of everything I was already struggling with in my life."|12782
I was so horribly unhappy about surviving that I spent months trying to work out a plan that would work, but I had to be super awesome international spy secretive about it because of having just made it through once.|12782
I was watched like a hawk, and not in the caring supportive way, in the fuck you you little shit you are not doing anything kind of way.|12782
Nobody was loving or caring or supportive in the way you had think they would be.|12782
Honestly, they all treated it as a cry for attention and they were beyond furious with me for it.|12782
"I still wish they knew it was not '""acting out'"" or attention-seeking."|12782
[BK][BK]Anyways, in those months where I planned very carefully, I started to come out of my depression.|12782
There were a few brief, fleeting moments where I was glad I failed.|12782
Those moments are still very rare, but at this point, it is too much work and causes too many problems to off myself.|12782
I also got a few degrees in psychology, which does not do much from a theoretical background, but rather in a practical sense.|12782
Being a therapist is one of the few things in life that makes me feel like I am not a total waste of elements.|12782
My dog is the primary thing that keeps me going.|12782
He turns 10 in five days.|12782
I am planning a party for him.|12782
Nobody will come, but I will plan it anyway.|12782
Planning for the future is difficult, but sometimes, just the right plans can be really helpful for keeping hope alive.|12782
[BK][BK]I still keep the option of suicide in my back pocket.|12782
It''s comforting.|12782
It does arise as my go-to first choice when things start going wrong, but I have learned to acknowledge it then put it back in the pocket.|12782
"Maybe someday it will be the right option, but not today. """|12782
"My first thought was something along the lines of 'wow, I am so stupid that I cannot even do this right?'"""|12782
Failure to die is not great encouragement that you should not have tried in the first place.|12782
[BK][BK]My second thought was something self deprecating about how long it would have taken anyone to find my body anyway.|12782
See, no one like, found me and stopped me or anything like that.|12782
What I tried just flat did not work.|12782
"It was a bad day."""|12782
This was two weeks ago for me.|12782
I woke up in the hospital with my boyfriend next to me.|12782
I remember thinking about how fucking sorry I was for the pain I was putting him through.|12782
He could not even look at me.|12782
Then when my parents showed up and started screaming at him and ripping into me, I remember just desperately wanting to leave the hospital and wanting them out of my room.|12782
I honestly hated them the whole time I was there, but I was too weak to even speak, let alone argue with them and tell them to leave.|12782
[BK][BK]When they moved me from the medical side of the ER to the psychiatric side, the only thing I could think about was how deeply I regretted what I would done.|12782
The psych ER was the worst fucking place I have ever been.|12782
I did not even feel human.|12782
"All I could think for the 12 hours before they moved me to a real psych ward was, 'if I had not taken those fucking pills, I would be curled up in my boyfriend''s arms right now instead of in a 6''x8'' whitewashed room with no sheets or pillows and Nick Jr on the TV while listening to some girl shrieking and running down the halls outside my door'""[BK][BK]Never again."|12782
If I get to that dark place again, I am admitting myself to a psych ward because that place was actually incredibly helpful.|12782
"But fuck dying and fuck the ER."""|12782
I have tried overdosing twice, once on over the counter meds and once on prescription.|12782
Obviously did not work either time (unless I am a ghost or this IS hell).|12782
"My first thought upon waking both times was 'Why cannot I just die already?!'"""|12782
"Followed by '""I cannot hear anything, work is going to be a nightmare'"" (side effect of the meds I took was thinned blood, and if your blood is below a certain consistency, apparently you will not be able to hear until it thickens back up, who knew)."|12782
[BK][BK]Haven''t attempted since, but not because I do not want to.|12782
I think about it literally everyday.|12782
"In fact my first thought every morning when my alarm goes off is '""I wish I was dead'""."|12782
You know how when you have a craving for a certain food, you can almost taste it?|12782
"I can almost feel the gun barrel in my mouth and my finger on the trigger."""|12782
At the time, I was disappointed and felt physically sick.|12782
I really did not plan on waking up.|12782
I had taken a LOT of pills.|12782
The police found me later in the day and took me to the hospital.|12782
I was screaming at everyone and being non-cooperative and they sent someone into the room with a needle.|12782
I prayed that I was going to be euthanized.|12782
It was only a sedative.|12782
I was later evaluated, put on meds, etc.|12782
[BK][BK]After that day, nothing felt real.|12782
Emotions, conversations, hobbies, special interests... it all felt so empty.|12782
My psyche had finally decided to end itself but was unsuccessful.|12782
I really never felt normal after that.|12782
I am here now, though, 2 years later.|12782
Call it a miracle.|12782
I just hope I can learn to be a friend again.|12782
Not a survivor as in went all in, but did go right up to the edge.|12782
Spent a year trying to figure out a method in which I could not back out.|12782
Turns out zip ties.|12782
First thought was; oh shit it is actually working.|12782
Just managed to cut it off.|12782
Perhaps 20 sec from real problems.|12782
Also got scared at how well a belt in a closed door works.|12782
Been a year.|12782
Less prone to it now.|12782
I woke up day after wondering if where I was.|12782
"Failed by slicing my arm the 'wrong'"" way."|12782
The arm is completely destroyed by scars varying from a couple of millimeters up to 2 cm wide cuts.|12782
I was a fraction of a millimeter to severed the main artery.|12782
I thank my dad for the conversation I had the morning after.|12782
"I never come close to try an attemt again. """|12782
I was 19 and a Freshman in College.|12782
[BK][BK]My whole life I would been the best.|12782
The best student, the best athlete, the best whatever...|12782
I would never experienced a situation when I did not rise to the top.|12782
[BK][BK]In college, while I was good, I was not the best and it ate at me.|12782
Then my girlfriend back home broke up with me.|12782
I got depressed, I started gaining weight, I was insulin dependent and quit taking my shots.|12782
I quit going to classes, hanging out with friends, I quit doing really anything other than drinking, eating and playing video games.|12782
[BK][BK]As the semester came to an end, I realized I was on the verge of flunking out of school.|12782
I would been a part of a group in the University that represented the top 5% of incoming freshman at a school that was top 3 in the nation for Engineering, and I was going to flunk out.|12782
[BK][BK]I could not take it, my pride, my self identity, all had been thrown away.|12782
[BK][BK]I decided to kill myself by overdosing on Insulin.|12782
But I did not want people to know I would killed myself, that was too shameful to me at the time.|12782
So I poured out a 1/5th of whiskey down the drain of sink in the bathroom and put it on the floor next to my bed.|12782
I then drew up 100 units of fast-acting insulin and stuck it in my thigh.|12782
It would make it look like I would just gotten drunk and tried to take my insulin and in my stupor used too much.|12782
As I prepared to push the plunger down, my roommate walked in.|12782
He was home early from class.|12782
[BK][BK]I took the needle out, and figured I would wait until he left for dinner, but instead he sat and talked with me.|12782
Told me he was worried about me, and thought I should go get some help.|12782
He knew I would been skipping classes and was upset about my girlfriend and said I should talk to someone, that he thought I might be depressed and I could get a waiver from my semester, so I would not flunk out.|12782
[BK][BK]Then he insisted I go take a shower and go have dinner with him.|12782
"[BK][BK]I told him, I needed to take my insulin and he looked at the needle and said 'P33J, that is a lot of insulin.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]I pretended to be shocked and made some excuse about being distracted by the TV or something and I threw the old needle away and drew up the insulin I actually needed.|12782
[BK][BK]Things slowly got better after that, I eventually graduated, got married had kids, started a good career.|12782
I have been living with depression for 15 years, and when I get stressed out or if my blood sugar gets out of whack, it gets worse, but I have resolved myself to talk to someone when that happens, rather than trying to handle it on my own.|12782
[BK][BK]It makes a difference.|12782
"Life''s precious, fragile and ultimately short, but fuck if it has not been worth it. """|12782
Well shit, I am still here.|12782
[BK][BK]I do wanna say something about this, though.|12782
That, for whatever reason I thought my life was so shitty that I needed to kill myself over, was in middle school.|12782
I am graduating high school in May and I have already started my freshman year of college.|12782
It honestly does get better.|12782
[BK][BK]I cannot say I am happy every day that I am alive.|12782
I still struggle with suicidal thoughts from time to time.|12782
I am mentally ill so I guess that is just in the programming.|12782
But I can honestly say that life is worth living.|12782
You'll experience things, meet people, have a whole life you never imagined for yourself.|12782
It'll suck some days.|12782
I am going over the worst break up of my life right now, so it sucks a lot.|12782
But you and I both have to keep breathing.|12782
I promise it will get better.|12782
The Earth will never throw more at you than you can handle.|12782
You've got this, buddy.|12782
'Fuck.|12782
"They''re gonna put me away for this'"""""|12782
I was fifteen the first time I tried to overdose.|12782
I took a bunch of pills and of course, threw them back up.|12782
I called my friend and he drove to my house and took me to the hospital.|12782
They kept insisting my father needed to know, despite the fact that he was a huge part of the reason I attempted in the first place.|12782
They notified him, things got worse.|12782
All I could think was 'I will have to try again.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]When I was seventeen I was pretty fucked up, I was addicted to pills and afraid of living."|12782
My boyfriend had overdosed and died when I was 16, and it fucked me up bad.|12782
I was still living with my shitass father, and he was mostly clueless as to how unwell I was.|12782
I tried to overdose again.|12782
I failed again.|12782
Called the same friend, and despite the fact that I had not talked to him in about a year he took me to the hospital.|12782
This time they did not notify my father.|12782
[BK]My friend cried.|12782
I cried.|12782
"I think my exact words were '""enough is enough, I just have to get the fuck out."|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I moved out a month after I graduated high school, and two years later I am doing a lot better."|12782
I am clean, I have got good friends I think, and I almost never even think about my father.|12782
[BK]Just because someone is your parent does not mean they are not horribly toxic.|12782
You do not owe them shit.|12782
"Do what you have to do-it is not being selfish, it is fucking survival. """|12782
I woke up the next morning feeling hopeless, but at the same time relieved.|12782
Yes, I had failed, but my dad did not have to find my body that day either.|12782
"[BK][BK]Later that month I did one of those 'FWD send to 12 people you care about'"" spams and sent one to my little brother."|12782
He, being like 10 at the time thought it was a goodbye text and called my estranged mother over.|12782
He was literally hysterical.|12782
"Before that happened, it never occurred to me that I would be missed. """|12782
My husband committed suicide 7 years ago and I have come a very long way in that time.|12782
I lost my best friend, college sweetheart, confidante and everything that has ever grounded me and the fight back was more than difficult - there are not even words to describe it.|12782
I still suffer from some residual PTSD and anxiety which I finally decided that I needed to take - I fought it for a long time.|12782
I wanted to be strong enough without it.|12782
I have often thought that I do not understand why all this has happened to me.|12782
A wise friend cautioned me recently that that why question is not helpful but focus on how to get through it.|12782
It made things clearer.|12782
I am a better person for all this - I know it in my soul.|12782
After relocation about 5 years ago, I finally took a job that was everything I ever wanted.|12782
It has not yet been a year and about a month ago with no warning, my boss starting giving me a very hard time.|12782
Feel like I am being treated unfairly and it is causing me a lot of stress, even with my medication.|12782
I have worked really hard and it all seems so unfair.|12782
I feel like I am the unfortunate scapegoat of something I could not have changed.|12782
I have meeting tomorrow that I am dreading where I am either going to be fired or severely dressed down and it is all I can think about despite by best efforts.|12782
It's hard not to wonder why this is happening - I keep thinking when will this all be enough?|12782
Haven't I gone through the enough to finally get a break?|12782
I know that is weak and counterproductive but I just want to coast for awhile.|12782
My husband saw the goodness and potential in me.|12782
I wish any of that mattered to anyone else.|12782
I am so so tired.|12782
I am trying.|12782
I am praying.|12782
He left me here to deal with all of this alone.|12782
It seems so unfair.|12782
"'I was not supposed to wake up'"" .....my wife told me that is what I said after she found me passed out."|12782
"She thought I was just drunk."""|12782
"After waking up, my first thought was 'you have so much to live for and for those who care about you'""."|12782
Its been 9 years since but it always remains a clear message in my head.|12782
Studying meditation, philosophy and psychology really turned things around for me.|12782
"If anyone is struggling with depression, your not alone, its completely normal and there ARE people that you can talk to that will make you feel comfortable, DONT EVER GIVE UP ON YOURSELF """|12782
"A weird mix of embarrassment for failing, berating myself for being so weak, and then a breath of 'Oh, thank God.'"""""|12782
"'I think its time to give sobriety an honest try'"" was my first thought waking up in the ICU with my parents crying over me after taking a bunch of tricylic antidepressants when the drugs stopped giving me any euphoria."|12782
Since that day my life has become a truly wonderful one with great friends a wonderful job and a wonderful home with many more good things still to come.|12782
I am very blessed to have a second chance at life and I do what I can to not squander it.|12782
Fellow survivors I believe there is a reason we made it through.|12782
Find that reason and live and to those going through the thick of it I promise life gets better than you can possibly imagine.|12782
"You will not always be down I promise you this"""|12782
Woke up to my cat scratching the hell out of my face.|12782
All I could think of is, well who the hell would take care of my cat if I am gone and will this cat stop scratching me?|12782
A urgent care center was right across the street, I passed out there and woke at another hospital.|12782
"'Goddamnit.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]Literally, just that single word.|12782
"Because waking up meant I failed, yet again."""|12782
I thought I was a failure that could not even get that right.|12782
[BK][BK]Doesn't help that the situation I was in got worse after that.|12782
I just did not have the energy anymore|12782
I was 11 years old, and I had tried jumping in front of a car.|12782
When the car missed me, I started crying and realized that I wanted too young to die.|12782
When I was 15 I took a whole shit load of TylenolPM thinking that would work.|12782
"I in a daze must have vomited in a corner of my room and when I woke up I was like 'I do not want to clean that up.'"""|12782
and kinda Just stuck to cutting.|12782
A lit of fucked up shit had happened to me in the past year so it seemed the best idea at the time.|12782
[BK][BK]But IDK I just started doing my own shit and not worrying about other people.|12782
And going to raves in the city and getting my own nontown friends.|12782
[BK][BK]The last time, I remember I drank a shit load of Jack Daniels and hoped it would be enough to Kill me in my sleep.|12782
But I did not.|12782
"[BK][BK]I think my initial thought was,  '""I guess maybe I should try to get help then.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]At that time I had a pretty good alcohol problem going on and nothing seemed to be working, I made meetings,  I saw a therapist but nothing was fixing that deep down I just wanted to die and alcohol was not solving that feeling anymore.|12782
[BK][BK]I still deep down wish I were dead.|12782
I am 32, I am overweight, and unemployed.|12782
"I could hide and say,  '""but I am a stay at home mother '"" but thats a lie,  I do not want to be a stay at home mother so I am definitely unemployed."|12782
[BK][BK]What keeps me not doing it is I would like to not be remembered as a huge fat ass.|12782
So I have got to lose some weight.|12782
And maybe, getting my masters might help with that inescapable feeling that I am m a failure.|12782
[BK][BK]Tho,  I remember this from that movie about David Foster Wallace that I have been infected by this American idea that somehow some grand gesture will cure me.|12782
"[BK][BK]But I do not have a plan, and I am pretty stable for now so it is all good. """|12782
I tried to hang myself a few years  ago.|12782
Obviously it failed, because I used a tie and it ripped.|12782
"My first thought was, 'Well just another thing I failed at.'"""|12782
When my parents found out about a couple years ago they freaked out.|12782
My dad threatened to put me in a mental institution and my mom guilt-tripped the hell out of me.|12782
"Needless to say, I do not plan on contacting them too much in the future. """|12782
"'Wow'"" That was basically it...I had taken 24 10mg Lortabs in the span of 8 hours before going to sleep...I had a high tolerance."|12782
I was not trying to actually kill myself but I honestly did not care anymore.|12782
I did not tell anyone before or after for a long time...I should not be here.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up with banging on my apartment door.|12782
It was 11am I was supposed to be at work at 5:30am... Open it to my bitch ex wife that was the reason I just did not care anymore...|12782
"I am clean now. """|12782
I decided I was going to drive my car into the river.|12782
Got stuck in the mud.|12782
I then decided I was going to gas myself.|12782
So I got out of the car and realized that the back end of my car was too high to bury fully with mud.|12782
[BK][BK]At that point the whole thing was off in my mind and I needed to get a tow.|12782
My first thoughts were about how I was a fucking idiot for getting my car stuck.|12782
[BK][BK]I was on new meds for my bipolar disorder.|12782
I was in a toxic relationship.|12782
So my head was all kinds of messed up.|12782
This was my last attempt and it happened about ~6 years ago.|12782
Although I still get really depressed from time to time.|12782
Suicide has been off the table since then.|12782
some of the answers gave me many insights.|12782
I am soon to be doctor.|12782
My lecturer in psychiatry dept always and  always reminded us about the danger of depression and as doctor we need to be in constant look out for the risk and help them at best.|12782
so thank you .|12782
I was 22, and I had gone through a reasonably harsh breakup.|12782
She was my first.|12782
I went to the local supermarket and got strong sleeping pills.|12782
I do not know if they can actually kill you, but I took about twenty and thought that would definitely do the trick.|12782
Woke up dehydrated as fuck, and very disoriented.|12782
I do not know how much time had passed.|12782
I was still living in the house with the ex and her boyfriend (My best friend at the time) and I stumbled to get water.|12782
The only thing going through my mind was how pissed I was that it did not work.|12782
I went on that way for three years with severe depression and self-harm with frequent thoughts of suicide.|12782
[BK][BK]The day I started to love myself was just one month ago.|12782
I realized people love me and care about me and that I am a good person.|12782
My internal agony disappeared completely.|12782
I am able to feel more, care more, do better things, lose weight, eat healthier, and kick my habitual drinKing into occasional drinking.|12782
I have honestly never felt better.|12782
The cause of all this?|12782
Another breakup.|12782
Funny how that works.|12782
My ex, while not right for me, she taught me how to take care of someone, and when she left I directed that knowledge on myself.|12782
I thank her for that, and now that I have happiness, I am glad my soul is still contained in this plane of existence because the world needs me, and I need it.|12782
It feels honestly amazing and I am proud of myself.|12782
My story is not exactly a suicide story.|12782
I never was at the point where I was going to do it.|12782
I thought about it, I wanted to, so many times.|12782
There was one time which I describe as the worst moments of my life, I had reached my lowest point and before I did anything I met two important people.|12782
My best friend and my girlfriend.|12782
I owe my girlfriend my life, she truly saved me.|12782
The bullying passed and all I became happier then ever before.|12782
To all the people thinking about suicide, find someone, a friend.|12782
Talk to them, it passes.|12782
Even if you think it will never get better, it does.|12782
I am now starting my own company to try to combat bullying and I never imagined my life could be this great!|12782
Hang in there :)|12782
My first thoughts were very unclear because I was still under the influence of several hundred pills - including a month's worth of Ambien.|12782
I remember thinking about my wife and how bad I felt that she would had to drive home because from a business trip because she could not find a flight to come to the ER.|12782
Well...|12782
It was like...  Shit shit shit!|12782
And then good, I never wanted to die.|12782
It was a realization to be honest.|12782
Gave me the realization that I need help and well fuck I am a hell of alot happier now after kicking out my mentally abusive girlfriend.|12782
I felt used and worn out when I gave up, went black, and opened my eyes after being found by my dad.|12782
Agreed to never tell the world but he set me up for so much help and potential in my life.|12782
Touched me even more with guilt knowing my best friend committed suicide when I was in gradeschool.|12782
I was 18 at the time.|12782
This was in 2013.|12782
[BK][BK]I would just come home for summer vacation from college.|12782
I would been out as trans at the campus, and accepted by everyone there.|12782
So coming back home to my conservative catholic family...piled on top of years of untreated mental illness and the creeping fear that I would never be a good enough adult.|12782
Something had to give.|12782
[BK][BK]I would told a friend that I would run away that night and be homeless.|12782
But I was to afraid to.|12782
So, I looked up every possible way to die, then decided the easiest would be hanging.|12782
[BK][BK]Luckily, there was not any fucking rope.|12782
But I was fucked up enough to try anyway.|12782
What I did have was some really strong thickish string that I just tied into a noose and prayed would last long enough.|12782
[BK][BK]Now, you say first conscious thought.|12782
And that, honestly, makes this question really hard to answer.|12782
"Because I was probably slipping in and out of consciousness for a while, and I do not know how 'conscious'"" one of the most memorable parts could be considered."|12782
So I suppose I will write down the play-by-play.|12782
[BK][BK]I remember finally working up the nerve to jump off of the chair, then clawing at the shelves I tied myself to.|12782
The next thing I remember is gasping for breath.|12782
For a little bit, that was the only sensation I had, just forcing air into my lungs.|12782
I was on the ground at this point, the rope had broke.|12782
But I could not feel it at all.|12782
I only realized I would hit the ground later, and only because...well, I must have.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not know how long the gasping lasted.|12782
But at some point, I started hallucinating.|12782
Or something.|12782
I do not know what I would call the experience.|12782
But it is incredibly sharp in my mind.I remember I was absolutely certain that there were two other people in the room with me.|12782
I did not know who or what they were, but I did not feel unsafe or scared.|12782
Well, not by them at least.|12782
I remember I thought I had to breathe to talk to them, and I forced myself to gasp in air so I could get out the words.|12782
I begged them to go downstairs to the kitchen, because there were scissors there, and they could save me.|12782
And one of them told me that they could not do that...that I had to save myself.|12782
[BK][BK]I managed to worm my fingers between the swollen skin of my neck and the broken noose, and ripped it off of me.|12782
"[BK][BK]The first completely rational thought I had after my attempt, after managing to pull myself onto my bed, was '""Why the fuck cannot I open my eyes?'"""|12782
Turned out the reason was that my face was swollen up like a balloon.|12782
"[BK][BK]And my last '""first'"" thought, when I woke up the next morning, was '""how the fuck do I get to the hospital without my parents knowing?'"""""|12782
"Ineffectively attempted to overdose nightly for 9 months...[BK]Literally the only thought that ever came was 'shit, guess ill try again tonight'"""""|12782
"Mine was as simple as 'better get to dinner before my dad screams at me some more.'"""""|12782
Suicide prevention is very serious!!|12782
If people try to kill their self and do not succeed, they really do not want to take their own life to begin with.|12782
They need counseling ASAP.|12782
I have lost a few friends to this.|12782
I always ask myself what if they they would have called?!|12782
?|12782
I felt ashamed, I did not tell anyone for over a year I just cleaned up my bathroom and pretended nothing happened.|12782
Probably going to get buried but my first thought was that I had less of a reason to live.|12782
I broke it off with a girl I was seeing at the time so she did not have to go through any pain, this also destroyed our friendship as it turned out that she had experienced overdoses so hated me.|12782
[BK][BK]It also got me ridiculed as someone I trusted like a sister made joked behind my back in college, caused me to study from home for a month and not work for 2.|12782
It also caused me to get hooked on codeine for months which made me very out of it.|12782
[BK][BK]However it did show me that someone did care, I messaged another girl I was close to basically crying out after I had overdosed.|12782
Saying sorry, have a good life etc.|12782
The next day she called me early in the morning to check if I was okay and met with me a few days later for a chat.|12782
[BK][BK]Also someone I kayak with told me we were going out on the canal to help me clear my head.|12782
For two hours we did not talk at all just kayaked in silence which helped.|12782
[BK][BK]I forgave the 2 people who turned on me as they both apologised.|12782
However I never forgave my stepdad who never knew about my overdose but when he discovered I was off work called me selfish and never spoke to me for days.|12782
Even now as I am a big guy from powerlifting my coping method if I get stressed is to cool down as I have a huge temper which very rarely comes out but when it does can be destructive.|12782
He does not see me cooling down but yells at me for walking away from situations I do not like.|12782
[BK][BK]Not the best idea to someone almost 100kgs of muscle with a temper.|12782
One time he started shouting in my face with my mum doing nothing and me trying to reason with him.|12782
That did not work so as he was trying to intimidate me I lost it and shouted back how he would not like it if I shouted at him.|12782
This caused him to push me back.|12782
[BK][BK]Side note I have a dodgy knee due to the weights I lift and if anyone does anything to possibly hurt it, it is the only time I get physical.|12782
He also had me cornered which is not a good idea.|12782
I pushed him away, grabbed my car keys and ran out the house.|12782
I did not care about repercussions at that point I wanted out.|12782
[BK][BK]I did return hours later and agreed to be civil with him.|12782
It also drove a wedge between me and my mum as she knows why I leave and come back to stressful situations once I calmed so I can think rationally but she just watched it and did not say a word.|12782
[BK][BK]Since his mum died he has been very civil to me but I still do not forgive how he acts towards me.|12782
Know that I moved over 150 miles away to uni my mental health has levelled however I still have panic attacks but not as often.|12782
But I will never forgive him for that.|12782
I have tried hanging, myself during life.|12782
Since I listen to a lot of metal music, and I listen to quite a lot of Mozart and Beethoven.|12782
At the age of 12, I was being bullied for my height and weight.|12782
It carrie on until I decided to hang myself when my mother caught me getting ready for my death.|12782
[BK][BK]Another time was when I was 14, and I had been beaten up and rejected by a lot of people, even some friends, I tried it in school, and I had to go to a psychologist.|12782
[BK][BK]And a few months ago, August I remember.|12782
I tried suicide again.|12782
"This time I decided 'I am going to drink bleach and try that.'"""|12782
I never did it, but I tried cutting one of my ears off then killing myself, by self inflicted knife wound.|12782
[BK][BK]But it never worked.|12782
"To be honest, I feel as though I am no one. """|12782
"'Fuck.'"""""|12782
"Honestly, my first thought was 'nothing will be the same again'""."|12782
I was in the hospital texting the people who absolutely had to know, and I realized that I could not go back to where I was before I would attempted, and scared the shit out of me.|12782
A week inpatient, a huge scar on my wrist, and my mom completely devestated.|12782
Unfortunately the life I was thinking about when I decided to call 911 was over, and I was so depressed about what I would fucked up by trying to kill myself that I tried to kill myself again the day after Christmas.|12782
"Model fucking son, right here."""|12782
To be honest, my first thought was 'What the hell just happened?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I was on Chantix when it drove me to suddenly think killing myself was a great idea."|12782
It felt normal.|12782
I got out some rope , tied it to the ceiling braces in the basement, stood on a chair and hung myself.|12782
I remember tunnel vision and everything going dark and then I somehow woke up on the floor.|12782
The noose was still intact and tied to the beam, and I was confused as hell and terrified.|12782
"[BK][BK]I immediately stopped taking Chantix."""|12782
Holding a knife to my chest, my older brother stopping me and saying, 'I have already tried that, trust me it does not make it any better.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]All I could think is, '""Oh thank god, it is not just me.'"""|12782
":( [BK][BK]Kinda was in a self loathing spiral there, and figured these feelings were all my fault, and that I was the only one who was broken."""|12782
I had lunged for the gun involved and was tackled by my neighbor before I could grab it.|12782
Not sure if that really counts.|12782
"[BK][BK]My thought while on the floor was 'maybe the cops will think I am armed and just shoot me.'"""|12782
I am glad I did not.|12782
"For the sake of the cop and myself. """|12782
"as soon as i cut myself, i basically looked down and immediately was like 'what the fuck did i just do,  mom (who was right there) call 911 i think I am dying'""."|12782
"and then i just kinda slumped over and the rest is a blur."""|12782
"My first thought was: 'Wow, and I managed to fuck this up, too.'"""""|12782
"'Well, might as well go through this whole gender transition thing.'"""""|12782
I pointed a 9mm at my head when I was 13 and in that moment I did not feel sad, glad or anything really just Super calm and very zen.|12782
It was all going to finally be over (severe emotional abuse and manipulation as well as being the scapegoat of the family) I made sure there was a round in the chamber and then pulled back the hammer and....I stopped..|12782
I did not want to stop, I wanted to end my life.|12782
But I did stop and now I am here still.|12782
I still deal with depression and I still want to kill myself but I just keep going..|12782
I play three instruments (drums,guitar and piano.|12782
All self taught) and I give piano lessons.|12782
Some days are harder than others but I guess my will to live beats a bullet to the head.|12782
[BK]|12782
"'Never been happier to be a fuckup,'"" I guess?"|12782
I tried to OD and a friend found me.|12782
"I do not really remember much around it but the flashes of them being so panicked and scared genuinely made me feel horrible about is and all I could think when I woke up more fully was that I was glad I was alive still."""|12782
Damn.|12782
"Then all my friends disappeared because I was 'desperate for attention.'"""|12782
""""|12782
I do not really know if this counts as a suicide attempt.|12782
I was five or six and was in first grade or preschool, and I always talked about wanting to die.|12782
Eventually I took out a knife.|12782
In my mind, I was going to put my head on the table and cut my neck like a guillotine.|12782
[BK][BK]I have no recollection what happened next.|12782
"Some time in the next few years, my mom said 'I thought you were really going to do it,'"" and that is pretty much all I remember about it."|12782
[BK][BK]I still think about killing myself every day.|12782
"Sometimes the thought of my parents is the only reason I do not."""|12782
My first thoughts and feelings were of guilt for what I had done (and almost done) to my loved ones who almost certainly would never understand why it happened.|12782
I woke up with my father (super hardass) looking at me like a crushed child in misery and I realized how much pain I caused and could have caused.|12782
Welp.|12782
Can't even do that correctly.|12782
It makes me very sad that people turn to suicide.|12782
It's a permanent solution to a temporary problem.|12782
Just came here to say that.|12782
Maybe someone who needs it will see this comment.|12782
It's so much better to talk to loved ones who can help instead of making them grieve because they did not even know you needed help to begin with.|12782
"'Oh yea, I gotta feed my cats'"""""|12782
Shit...time to try again.|12782
[BK]That was my first thought.|12782
And I did, many times.|12782
"'Why did I wake up?'"""|12782
I spent weeks looking up a way to kill myself with the dozens of pills that were prescribed to me at the time.|12782
I was fifteen and had just been told I have defective genes, HLA-B27 to be exact, and was due to suffer from every chronic illness my mother had.|12782
My youngest brother found my laying in bed after three days and freaked out, apparently my breathing was shallow and my lips were blue so he freaked out and called for an ambulance before my parents even found out.|12782
"I love my little brother to death, but to this day, I cannot help but wonder '""What if?'"""""|12782
I felt pretty disoriented that morning.|12782
Was admitted into a mental hospital the night before for overdosing on half a bottle of zoloft(?|12782
I think.|12782
Don't exactly have the best memory.)|12782
I really missed my fiancé.|12782
This happened a week before our anniversary, and I still feel guilty about it these days.|12782
"My first thought after waking up was 'Fuck, now I have to clean this shit up.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]Woke up in a puddle of my own vomit on the floor of my room.|12782
I guess I vomited up the pills, and passed out from the alcohol.|12782
"[BK][BK]I still want to kill myself, every day, but I have not tried since because I know that my parents (specifically my mom) would never get over it."""|12782
I have not attempted suicide but I do feel that I should respond with something because of own experience and the experience of those who have passed through my life:[BK][BK]Suicide is a means to an end.|12782
People who consider or try have had their life wrought with pain, depression, or a great loss.|12782
Often all they want is for that pain to recede or, looking at it a different way, to finally feel better.|12782
Many of you who read this do not know what true depression is like, how crippling it can truly be.|12782
Many more, myself included, are largely unaware how debilitating certain conditions or disorders can be for the individual experiencing them.|12782
[BK][BK]All of this is just on the surface.|12782
[BK][BK]The pain, doubt, fear, loathing, and possible hatred of oneself or one's situation can bring about the darkest moments in a person's life.|12782
Suicide is often the way to stop all of that, to not feel like absolute shit any longer.|12782
I ask you all that if anyone even mentions suicide *take it seriously*.|12782
Do **not** try to talk them out of it, just stay with them and be there.|12782
Be a part of their life for the short time it takes for them to realize that maybe there are other ways.|12782
[BK][BK]Now I will not lie, you cannot save everyone.|12782
If someone wants to commit suicide and is absolutely set on doing so, there is not much you can do.|12782
But nor should you walk away.|12782
It may not be your responsibility, you may not even feel right doing it, but if you can save a life please do not hesitate.|12782
[BK][BK]If you feel like you may be at risk or know someone who is at risk you can join the community over at /r/suicidewatch or get them help from family and professionals with their permission.|12782
People have a right to live.|12782
We should reinforce that right through our own kindness and our own compassion.|12782
Be a hero, you may never get the chance again.|12782
Goddamnit.|12782
That was the first thought.|12782
There were two different times I had tried to commit suicide and actually came close to dying.|12782
[BK][BK]My boyfriend at the time was very emotionally and verbally abusive and I felt so low that I could not bring myself out of it.|12782
I felt that nothing I did ever mattered.|12782
At this point I had lost all my friends because of him telling me they were no good for me.|12782
The first time I had taken roughly 120 OTC pills (generic sleep aids, tylenol, advil combo) and realized 'OH FUCK HOW IS MY SISTER GOING TO BE.|12782
"THIS IS WEIRD STOP IT.'"""|12782
I ended up just riding out the effects and somehow managed to survive it (Guys, please do not ever do this.)|12782
And tried to live for another year until it happened again.|12782
For the next year I had thought about what it would do to my younger sister (12 at the time) and that kept me going strong until I went to college.|12782
Unfortunately, I became addicted to them and ended up using them as a means for dealing with life.|12782
[BK][BK]The second time, I took roughly 100 pills over the course of two days.|12782
By this time I was living at college, had a different boyfriend who was as sweet as could be, and removed physically from my family.|12782
Being in a new environment with distant conversations about how I was not doing everything right with my family, extremely low self esteem, and not having any friends led me to just binge on sleep aids for two days.|12782
I had gotten really upset with my boyfriend for that second night and ended up taking the rest of the bottle I had started the night previously at his dorm room.|12782
Ended up blacking out and waking up in a psych ward bed having the vaguest idea of how I got there and why it happened.|12782
"I started thinking '""Where the fuck am I?"|12782
"Who the fuck... oh fuck I am screwed.'"""|12782
I remember being really upset that I had not succeeded, but also relieved because I found out mycollege roommates had been coming every day to see me and make sure I was okay (the hospital was a 20 minute car ride, hour walk.|12782
They walked every day to the hospital after classes to see how I was doing.)|12782
And I realized I had reasons to live and that I will always have people there for me.|12782
[BK][BK]Now I am a full time Barista and going to school, own a car, and looking at apartments with a really cool coworker.|12782
"My marks are all extremely high and I have learned how to cope with life and have an amazing support system."""|12782
I attempted suicide at age 14.|12782
Mother told me twice to kill myself and that if she could go back, she wouldnt have married my dad nor had any kids.|12782
So I found a rope in my dads tool shed, went into the woods, and tried to hang myself from a tree.|12782
The rope was old, so it snapped from rubbing on the bark.|12782
When I hit the ground I heard laughter, which at the time I thought was the gods (I was Graecan) laughing at my failures and denying me my escape; ive since realized that it was my own hatred of myself and my inner demons, and am now a 20 yr old reformed Christian, with a beautiful girlfriend I am planning on proposing to soon.|12782
I woke up in a hospital bed at the psych ward after overdosing on sleep medications confused and groggy.|12782
My first thought?|12782
"[BK][BK]'This place again.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]That was 3 years ago when emotionally my life was in a freefall.|12782
There was just so much going on and I was only operating with 3 hrs of sleep for going on 5 days straight along with constantly changing medications by my doctor to find the right concotion for me.|12782
It just was a bad situation.|12782
My wife had left after being hospitalized herself, my parents took my kids, the army was...well...the army, and I was just...alone.|12782
[BK][BK]Glad to say things are a lot better now and I know now, no matter how hard things get...or how bad it is...or even how much easier life would be for me if I just did not exist...it gets better.|12782
My wife and I reconciled after an affair she was having...kids came back.|12782
It turns out my dad was manipulating the both of us...and when we started communicating with each other things changed.|12782
"We have been great ever since. """|12782
"'Now what?'"""|12782
[BK][BK]I was kinda scared and nervous because I was not even sure if it was sincere or not, and was not sure if I should try again.|12782
I was alone and had nobody around to check on me so I was not hoping/expecting on anyone finding me in time.|12782
But I still felt so surprised that I had finally taken that (what I thought was) last step.|12782
I ended up in a clinic for a few weeks and tried again while there and did actually decide to try again.|12782
That time I was very certain I wanted to end it.|12782
The medication they put me on really impaired my judgement.|12782
After the second try in the clinic I ended up giving up and decided to revisit the idea when I got out and was alone.|12782
That was a few years ago and I am still here.|12782
I still frequently have the thoughts and can get into a deep depression where I map out my steps and plan it out to be sure it looks accidental for insurance purposes.|12782
"It takes a few days and I snap out of it, and have not sincerely tried since. """|12782
It's not something I have talked about much, I think only one person knows how far I got.|12782
But for the most part, I decided to abort my attempt.|12782
I tried with pills, but about 15 minutes afterwards I could not stop thinking about my family members.|12782
I have no problem with death, but I have an older family and I was too worried to be able to go through with it.|12782
If my family was younger/healthier I probably would have gone through with it, but while I have no problems taking my own life I will not take anyone with me.|12782
My mom has had health issues her whole life, and my grandparents on my father's side are very old (grampie's going to be 100 next month).|12782
[BK][BK]So, the first thought I had was of my family I guess.|12782
I never went to the hospital or doctor but I felt like crap for the first few days recovering from it.|12782
I did not necessarily feel regret, more like just regret at it not being a good time for it.|12782
I have had a few episodes since then (it was almost 8 years ago) but have not really tried again.|12782
Still depressed but not as severely.|12782
Although if I could go peacefully without inflicting too much pain I would probably do so.|12782
Long story short I was manipulated for a period of 6 months and raped by one of my marine corps recruiters.|12782
He did some pretty sick things and I was afraid to say no and get the cold shoulder (I liked the attention).|12782
I did not have time to process what happened until I was already in boot camp and I reported him and had a huge investigation take place.|12782
When he was finally court marshaled (taken to court) there were literally PAGES OF GIRLS who said similar things happened to them as well.|12782
Nobody understood why I was having so much anxiety and crying all of the time, especially in the marine corps.|12782
I tried to kill my self 4 times while in the military.|12782
Twice by overdosing on prescription sleeping pills, once I almost managed to walk myself off of a cliff, and the final time I seriously considered to hang myself but did not have anything to do it with.|12782
I do not remember what my first thoughts where when I realized that I am still going to live but I am happy that I am and get to spend time with my niece and nephew and my friends and family.|12782
My first and only real suicide attempt i tried to overdose on a cocktail mixture of prescription anxiety and pain killers as well as over the counter at age 15.|12782
I took A LOT.|12782
So i was lying in this field in my neighborhood that cars usually parked in (it was a local Church''s property) and i remember feeling so heavy i could not hold myself up anymore.|12782
Two of my friends from the neighborhood stumbled upon me and noticed i was *really bad.|12782
* After realizing i had not done enough to kill myself, i was distraught but also really hungry.|12782
Hunger is a common side affect with the prescription anxiety reliever that i took.|12782
"my friend said to me (and these are the only two sentences i remember from the incident, as i blacked out) 'Anon, you are my friend but if you do not sit up I am gonna have to call an ambulance.'"""|12782
"I retorted '""Just let it run it is course!'"""|12782
[BK][BK][BK]However like i said, it was not enough to effectively kill me, just black me out and make me feel incredibly heavy as well as extremely painful all over my body.|12782
It was so uncomfortable, i was immobile.|12782
That day i overdosed but did not die.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]If anyone is having feelings of sadness or otherwise, please consider seeing a mental health professional.|12782
"I hope everyone the best."""|12782
I woke up in the hospital with a cop beside me.|12782
I remember thinking his badge was a sticker and trying to remove it.|12782
Fascinated by the colors.|12782
[BK][BK]I had swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills and drank a bottle of expensive wine.|12782
I picked out a very specific bottle for the occasion.|12782
My boyfriend at the time came home and found me, thought I was bullshitting until I turned blue and passed out.|12782
We're did not have a phone so he went to the apartment downstairs to use the phone.|12782
My family was never contacted (I lived in a different province than them).|12782
I spent a week in the psych ward so doped up that I did not really think of anything.|12782
I wasnt happy at having survived.|12782
I did not feel up to trying again.|12782
It was a long time if being very numb.|12782
[BK][BK]I eventually got myself out of the situation that led to the event, an abusive relationship.|12782
Where I discovered he had also been on sites like adult friend finder.|12782
And looking up underage porn using my computer.|12782
It was a nightmare.|12782
And despite being almost a decade ago I definitely struggle with relationships and trust issues and being unable to deal with anyone with the slightest bit of a temper.|12782
Part of me wants to warn the men I get involved with about the whole past, but it is something I have never spoken about with anyone I have been romantically involved with since.|12782
Actually aside from the asshole who caused me to attempt this and then was responsible for saving me, not a single other person has ever gotten the whole story.|12782
And less than 5 people know I ever tried to kill myself.|12782
It's a heavy thing I reflect on far too often|12782
'am I dead?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]This is from my second attempt."|12782
My first attempt I put a loaded gun from my stepdads closet in my mouth and my friend called and asked if I wanted to go bowling, made me realize I did not want to die.|12782
Or so I thought.|12782
On my second attempt I tried to OD.|12782
I was 17.|12782
I remember waking up, and like many others have said, I was shackled to a hospital bed.|12782
I was just confused everything was so bright at first I thought I was in the afterlife.|12782
I was so disoriented but eventually came to and saw my parents standing there.|12782
All I could do was cry and tell them I was sorry over and over again till I fell back asleep.|12782
[BK][BK]If you ever feel so depressed you want to end your life, reach out.|12782
As cliche as it sounds just tell someone, get any help you can.|12782
It''s not worth putting your family through the pain and torment they will feel, whether you do end your own life or not, they think they have failed you as parents.|12782
My dad still believes himself to be a terrible father and he was not, but he blames himself still.|12782
[BK][BK]Death is not worth escaping your troubles.|12782
As shit as it gets sometimes you have to believe that there is something good around the corner.|12782
I recently (22 now) thought about ending my life again about a year ago.|12782
I was house sitting for my grandparents and decided to get a bunch of friends together for one last hurrah.|12782
They brought more people and I ended up meeting my girlfriend and she is the greatest thing to ever happen to me.|12782
"[BK][BK]There is always something good in the world to keep on fighting for."""|12782
This will get buried, but I feel obligated to share my story.|12782
[BK][BK]I was 14 at the time and a lot was going on.|12782
I was a freshman in high school and just broke up with my then gf who I adored.|12782
My parents were going through a brutal divorce and were not ashamed of throwing my brothers and I in the middle of it.|12782
We were crammed up--all 7 of us-- in a 900 sq ft house.|12782
My mother was a crackhead back then.|12782
So one day I get a call to go to my gf''s house at like 8-9pm to try to mend things.|12782
I get there after walking in the pouring rain and stood at her door as she came out to interrogate me about cheating (which I did not do).|12782
She asked if I bought such and such a flower for flower day (which I did for quite a few of my friends) and I say yes and she straight snuffed me.|12782
Still got the scar.|12782
[BK][BK]So I said fuck it.|12782
I went home, grabbed an assload of pills (fuckin Tylenol....|12782
I was 14), set a cross beside me on my bed, prayed, and downed the whole bottle.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up the next morning puking my brains out.|12782
"My mom came in and saw 'the set-up'"" and instantly realized what I attempted to do and called poison control."|12782
"After a bunch of Gatorade and a lot of watching '""EmTV'"" (back when The Marshall Mathers LP came out), I recovered."|12782
My mom and I never spoke about it since.|12782
Maybe once briefly immediately afterwards.|12782
[BK][BK]I just remember waking up and not remembering what I did to make myself so sick.|12782
I remembered after a few seconds and did not give it much thought.|12782
[BK][BK]That summer (the incident happened in April-May of 2000) was the best summer of my life.|12782
I never had so much fun and met so many new people (who are my best friends to this day).|12782
"[BK][BK]I remember thinking a few months later, '""Wow."|12782
Had that attempt worked, I would not be enjoying myself this much right now.|12782
I would be missing all this.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I am now 30 years old, just married my daughter''s mother and making good money."|12782
Looking for a house to buy as of now and just enjoy life in general.|12782
Everything about it.|12782
[BK][BK]EDIT: I just wanted to add some advice to those out there that may contemplate, especially for the teenagers out there... Don''t make any impulse decisions.|12782
Life has a funny way of working shit out for everyone.|12782
After high school, you wont see or talk to anyone anymore for the most part.|12782
Just know that you have the power to make things better.|12782
Survive high school and your life really begins.|12782
Make the best of it and do not take shit from anyone.|12782
"[BK]"""|12782
When I was 14 I tried to slit my wrists with a piece of broken glass.|12782
I did not want to die, I just did not want to live how I was.|12782
I sawed into my wrist with tears and fury and sat there behind my Jr high school in an alley waiting to die.|12782
It never happened.|12782
I was disappointed but relieved after half an hour.|12782
I was bleeding but nothing life threatening apparently.|12782
I went home after that, back to the life I hated but with a slightly different outlook because I knew I did not want to die, I could not.|12782
My brother and sister needed me.|12782
Years later I was the one who had to sit in my brothers apartment with clorox wipes and rags cleaning his belongings so they could be removed after his shotgun suicide.|12782
We could not afford to have someone else do it, I hung sheets on the walls so I did not have to look at the mess and put towels on the globs of brain matter and skull fragments that sat in piles on the floor next to me, since the sofa was where he sat and it was dripping with his remnants.|12782
As I went around cleaning I saw what I thought were fillings from teeth but turned out to be the pellets from the shotgun that had lodged into the drywall and fallen out coated in white powder.|12782
There was not one area that was not covered in matter.|12782
And dutifully I sat there for hours cleaning it all up.|12782
I am grateful that I lived to be able to save my mom from having to do that.|12782
I am so angry at my brother for having done this but I also understand how low you have to feel to get to that point.|12782
I no longer have many memories of my brother other than what I had to do for him that day.|12782
My psyche could not take it, everything else except for a few limited memories and thoughts has been blocked and muddied by the sheer act of scrubbing bits of skull and brain off his belongings.|12782
Sadly I can talk about that with great detail and be so numb that I do not notice the revolted look on peoples faces.|12782
The smell is with me always, sometimes it will overpower me and make me sick.|12782
And through all of it I still feel as if it was my fault.|12782
[BK] I share all of this in hopes that if someone is feeling suicidal just remember that almost every person that has been there and gotten past the feeling or survived an attempt has been glad that they did not do it.|12782
Times will get tough.|12782
People are assholes.|12782
Feelings suck.|12782
But its the people that are left behind will never be the same.|12782
Once its done, its done.|12782
There's no reversal.|12782
The only thing that it resolves is the temporary pain that you are in but it creates a permanent pain for those of us that are left to think about it every day.|12782
You may not feel it now but you are more important than you think and loved by more people than you realize.|12782
My first conscious thoughts were being really freaked out.|12782
I drank a liter of vodka, looked up the lethal dose of benadryl, took that, took a bunch of xanax, percoset, and ambien all mixed together.|12782
[BK]I heard my name being called from the shadows of my room.|12782
That night I kept hearing people call my name from different spots around the room.|12782
I had never had an experience like this, and was really scared/freaked out.|12782
I was hoping the cocktail of pills and alcohol would kill me and here I am being scared out of my mind.|12782
So I laid there, not being able to move for what felt like days, hearing people calling my name and talking to me.|12782
Also, I was extremely thirsty because of the bottles of benadryl I took.|12782
It was not a pleasant experience.|12782
[BK]Since then, I got help, started a medication, and had a lot of therapy/counseling.|12782
For the longest time, I thought it was simply normal to think about killing yourself most days.|12782
It was something that would float around my head.|12782
Since I got help, I have not had these thoughts for quite a while.|12782
[BK]If there is anyone who is having a tough time, please feel free to message me!|12782
Letting things out is one of the most important things you can do.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: I found out the reason I did not die that night is because I am a super processor for several pain killers and different pills.|12782
My first thought was that there was something in the ether trying to keep hold of me, stop me from disappearing into the fog.|12782
"Then it dissolved into 'shit I cannot even do that properly....'"""""|12782
'Well.|12782
Shit.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I remember getting up in the morning and it just *hurt*."|12782
Everything hurt, buy mostly inside.|12782
It did not hurt enough, though, so I rubbed every wound with salt.|12782
I mean, literally, I had covered myself in them, from the back of my shoulders to the tops of my feet.|12782
The room was freezing and I rubbed everything with salt and got dressed.|12782
[BK][BK]I remember going down and having breakfast, and it was spring but wet and cold, and absolutely nothing had changed.|12782
Nothing.|12782
I had not, the world had not.|12782
It was like I would never done anything at all.|12782
[BK][BK]Putting on my heavy backpack was agony, I remember my shoulders cracked open again.|12782
Then I went to school and after that to weekend camp.|12782
After camp, on Sunday, my friends forced me to the A&E, and they admitted me to the children''s ward.|12782
[BK][BK]I was admitted Sunday evening and by Wednesday noon they would decided I was already getting the care and support I needed.|12782
45 minutes of therapy every 14 days and Prozac.|12782
[BK][BK]I am very, very bitter about that.|12782
It was not enough.|12782
I would been doing 45 minutes for years and Prozac for months.|12782
[BK][BK]I left.|12782
I left everything behind before I turned off age.|12782
I was not meant to do that, but I had a safe spot and was in it when my world exploded some months later and I staid.|12782
[BK][BK]Almost fifteen years later, I am doing good.|12782
Well, I have had one recent bout of depression that has left me on sick leave, but I have not self-harmed and I have not needed hospitalisation.|12782
Besides, one bout in 15 years?|12782
I can do this.|12782
"It''s nothing, compared to where I have been. """|12782
Tried driving myself into the wall at high speeds away from public while intoxicated.|12782
Attempt was because of hidden  penis syndrome, coupled with the worst case of balanitis xerotica obliterans my uroligist has ever seen.|12782
[BK][BK]I still  think of other ways to get it done, i mean.|12782
I need surgery  that my urologist cant perform because i have a large pubis mons (pelvis, in short).|12782
[BK][BK]First thought  after i realized i wasnt successful?|12782
I should have got an automatic.|12782
I cant drive a stick shift while drunk.|12782
[BK][BK]Seen my primary care doctor.|12782
Got anti depression medications and while its not as bad as it used to be, I am on a bit of a time limit.|12782
I have until the end of this year to somehow lose enough  weight that my pubis mons fat goes away, or they might have to do a penectomy.|12782
[BK][BK]I refuse to live that life.|12782
So I am scrambling looking for a doctor who will do liposuction  in just that area, then i can get penile reconstruction done... but its not looking promising.[BK][BK]Halp?|12782
Lol.|12782
You can read more about this problem in my past comments.|12782
Apologies now for misspelling or grammar.|12782
Typing on my phone.|12782
Some dazed combination of how?|12782
Where am I?|12782
What day is it?|12782
I tried to overdose.|12782
I was a sophomore in high school.|12782
Honestly it is a blur why because I cannot imagine now feeling so low.|12782
I snuck past my mom while she was napping on the couch and filled a plastic bag with headache pills and then some other type (cannot remember what).|12782
I stashed it in my drawer and waited for the moment to come when I knew I was ready.|12782
I got in a stupid argument with my mom two days later and sat on the side of the house with a water bottle and started taking them.|12782
I think I only got to 45 before my gag reflex kicked in.|12782
I could not for the life of me get any more down without gagging.|12782
Immediately I panicked thinking I had not taken enough to die and would be a vegetable.|12782
I called my best friend and started getting loopy, walking around the neighborhood and dropping pills behind me.|12782
My friend convinced me to go back to my house and try to throw up the pills.|12782
I instead went to my room and passed out.|12782
[BK]I woke up dazed.|12782
I remember panicking thinking I had fucked my brain up because I was so loopy.|12782
Then I was wondering what wet stuff was on the side of my mouth (throw up).|12782
And then wondering why it felt so uncomfortable between my legs (catheter).|12782
Then the next few days were a blur until they put me in an ambulance to a mental hospital.|12782
[BK][BK]I do remember I could not look my mom in the eye and it made her leave the room sobbing.|12782
The only person I would talk to is my sister.|12782
It made me realize how fucked all of my relationships with everyone were and what a shitty person I had become.|12782
I regret that I made my family suffer through that (and pay thousands for the hospital bills) but I honestly do not think anything else would have woke me up and made me stop being such a shitty person to everyone, including myself.|12782
That I am too much of a pussy to go out in terrible pain, so I have to wait until I can rent a gun.|12782
I was just so thankful that I did not I did not go through with it [BK][BK]About 4 years ago I was 16 and suffered with depression my whole life and after seeing about 5 or 6 different therapist I decided that I could not handle it anymore.|12782
My mothers boyfriend at the time had an assortment of guns and I decided to break into his gun cabinet and load one.|12782
[BK] [BK]I sat there with a gun to my head for about 10 minutes before I realized I would be doing more harm to my family rather than solving my issues.|12782
I knew that at some point that things had to get better.|12782
My life is great and I had a family that loves and cares about me and I could not deal with the fact that I would be making life for them harder than it should be.|12782
It felt like such a selfish part on my end.|12782
[BK] [BK]It took me over two months to confess what I did and I was finally able to get the help I really needed.|12782
I am truly thankful that I was able to convince myself out of something that I would have regretted.|12782
Tried with pills.|12782
Roomate wokea up extra early for the bathroom and found me just in time.|12782
[BK]Doctor said I was a couple hours off dying.|12782
[BK][BK]My first thought when I woke up was that of sadness and anger that I failed; even with all my family in the ER.|12782
I even harbored some resentment and hate to my roommate for saving me for a few months.|12782
This was in September last year.|12782
[BK]Now I am doing a lot better and I am really glad that I survived.|12782
Life has really started looking up finally.|12782
[BK][BK]To anyone that has similar thoughts or intentions please try to get help from anyone.|12782
Or turn yourself into a hospital.|12782
Life is worth living even through the dark painful moments, it will get better.|12782
Not over night, and it will take me effort, but it is worth it.|12782
I woke up in the ICU after being in a coma for 5 days.|12782
I cried because I had failed.|12782
Okay,  I tried twice and had my heart stop more or less spontaneously 4 other times.|12782
"Usually it is just 'Oh,  well guess I am back here again.'"""|12782
"The first time it was more '""Holy shit why does everything hurt.'"""|12782
"Once it was just '""shit now I need to try again.'"""|12782
""""|12782
I was in even more pain then before.|12782
I had to deal with the guilt of scaring my parents, siblings, and friends.|12782
I had to go through a week of being on a psych ward, having panic attacks multiple times a day.|12782
Found out I had bi-polar and borderline personality disorders, along with the depression and anxiety.|12782
Started seeing a new therapist and psychiatrist because I was forced to.|12782
[BK][BK]It's been a year and a half.|12782
I still want to kill myself, but I cannot.|12782
I cannot do it to my mom, who cries herself to sleep because her daughter is in so much pain.|12782
Or my sister, who blames herself because of the way she treated me as a kid.|12782
Or my dad, who I saw cry for the first time when I was in the hospital.|12782
Or to my friend, who was the one that realized my text was actually a suicide note and called me and the ambulance, and then met me at the hospital and had another friend who lived near me follow the ambulance.|12782
She is about to graduate nursing school, I do not want to cause her pain and and then not be able to finish school.|12782
[BK][BK]My mom and sister just started going to this support group for family members of people with mental health issues.|12782
They are really trying to help me, but I do not even know if I want to help myself.|12782
I do not want to be in pain anymore and I do not want to deal with being up and down all the time.|12782
I have a crappy life, I have a crappy job, the only good thing in my life is my family and friends.|12782
I do not want to let them down, but at the same time I know I will not be able to go on like this forever.|12782
[BK][BK]Tl;dr: Pain.|12782
Still hurts.|12782
Family and friends help but cannot stop me forever.|12782
That I was being stupid, there is nothing that a human cannot get through.|12782
We are built to adapt, we are built to change and get better.|12782
If anyone gets to the stage that they consider suicide, obviously it is tough, but (cliché warning) it is a long term solution to a short term problem.|12782
[BK][BK] Everyone should also know that no matter what there are people who think they matter, some who loves them.|12782
[BK][BK]Depression, particularly at the advanced stage that brings on suicidal thoughts destroys everything inside us, takes our self esteem and makes us think we are worthless and no-one loves us.|12782
This is not, nor will it ever be true.|12782
People will support you, people will have your back and at the end of the day,no matter what, help is always just a text, call, message or pm away.|12782
[BK][BK]All the love to my brothers and sisters going through tough times right now.|12782
There is a light at the end of the tunnel just hold your strength and hold onto yourself.|12782
It will get better!|12782
[BK][BK]So much love for everyone out there!|12782
Fucked it up 2 times.|12782
Second time I was 19.|12782
Just lost my fun, had no real hobbies beside handball & school was college was so easy that it felt like nothing to achieve the grades.|12782
Some late night I didnt go to sleep but took the car & went like 190km/h on highway.|12782
Turned the sWheel & thats where my memories stopped.|12782
Later in hospital they told me that they somehow managed to get me out of that wreck with like no injuries (only broken arm).|12782
"I managed to state that 1 as 'too less sleeping'""."|12782
[BK][BK]My 1st try was with 16.|12782
Nearly dropped out of school cause I wasnt interested in anything there.|12782
Too easy, doc''s tested me & said im one of the top 0.09% most intelligent people tested by this test.|12782
Layd back & nothing was worth any effort.|12782
One morning on my way to school I stopped by some bridge which is like 8m high (some over a street).|12782
It took me like 10-20 minutes before I took a seat on the edge.|12782
Some seconds later I tried to push myself away while feeling something holding me from the back.|12782
Some stranger watched me all the time & kept me on this bridge.|12782
"She promised me that she will never tell anyone as long as I dont try it again..."""|12782
"'Wow, I am such a failure piece of shit that I cannot even kill myself correctly'""."|12782
I had been a self injurer for years, punishing myself for not living up to my own expectations.|12782
This particular night I went out drinking with my roommates during college.|12782
We got back to the house and I was so steaming mad at myself I decided I deserved to die during the car ride home.|12782
Went in my room, got my box cutter and started slashing myself.|12782
I never cut deep enough to hit an artery so I gave up.|12782
That was lowest I have ever felt in my life.|12782
[BK][BK]I hope this does not get buried because self injury is horribly misunderstood.|12782
Many think its a cry for attention and I feel sometimes people use it as such.|12782
In reality you could care less about what others were thinking.|12782
You hate yourself so much that you feel the need to be punished.|12782
You punish yourself and feel a feeling of satisfaction that you are setting things right and you completely deserve it.|12782
Down the road you get hooked on the feeling of the pain and its almost like drug.|12782
[BK][BK][BK][BK]Edit: I am kinda shocked redditors are viewing the story of my suicide attempt as controversial.|12782
I am truly at a loss for words.|12782
I mean people are sharing extremely intimate secrets of their lives here.|12782
To downvote anyone other than someone trying to make a joke here is just brutal.|12782
[BK][BK]I commend the courage of others who have shared their stories.|12782
I was shivering when typing my because I had to essentially relive it again in all its shame.|12782
"Probably not unlike the rest of you."""|12782
I thankfully never completed my suicide attempt.|12782
[BK][BK] I sat on my couch with a knife to my wrist and had even written a note, but then I just could not go through with it.|12782
[BK]I do not remember much from right afterwards I think I just fell asleep and spend the next day on my couch in a complete stupor.|12782
[BK][BK]I had been suicidal for awhile before this happened, I spend most days planning how best to do it in the back of my mind, if I could get my hands on a gun or if I should cut myself.|12782
I just wanted it to be fast.|12782
[BK][BK]My actual attempt kinda came out of the blue, there was nothing in particular that triggered it right then, one evening I just felt that I had had enough and could not take it anymore.|12782
I was in a pretty deep depression at the time and had recently had to drop out of my education because of it.|12782
[BK][BK]This happened in beginning of 2011 and the rest of that year is just one big blur to me now.|12782
It was not untill around the end of the year when some of my friends came to visit and saw my apartment piled up with old pizza boxes and other trash, they gave me a push to seek some help and regain some control over my life.|12782
[BK][BK]I spend 2012 slowly getting better, I even got back to my education and finished the next year.|12782
I will probably have to take some meds for the rest of my life, but that is a small price to pay, to avoid falling into a hole like that ever again.|12782
the last time I attempted suicide was in 2013.|12782
I OD'd on celexa, trazodone and topomax.|12782
I woke up in the ambulance with blood ALL OVER ME, shivering and crying.|12782
The emergency worker told me they found me in the campus parking lot passed out.|12782
I did not remember calling 911 at all, I only remembered taking the pills and laying in bed.|12782
At that time I still was not sure if I was going to make it, because I was going in and out of consciousness.|12782
[BK][BK]After a few hours in the ER and realizing that I was going survive, the first thing I thought of was how upset my Mom was going to be, and how I was going to explain this to her.|12782
This had been my third suicide attempt in two months.|12782
I was so angry at myself for wanting to die but not being able to go through with it.|12782
[BK][BK]Now a few years later I deeply regret doing those things to myself, and hurting my family so much.|12782
My brother and sister have a rough relationship with me.|12782
I love my family, and I am learning to love myself every day <3|12782
I thought to myself, 'Well I am a dumbass, of course slamming my head on a brick wall is not gonna work.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I only tried to do it that way because I wanted to do it in front of the people that made me want to do it and I could not think of any other way to do it."|12782
"[BK][BK]Edit: words"""|12782
I was really overwhelmed by the look on everyone's face as they watched me get wheeled out.|12782
They were so horrified-they would never seen anything like that before.|12782
I kept thinking about how much worse it was going to be when my family came to see me.|12782
My heart was already broken enough but it was about to get that much worse.|12782
' How am i still alive ?|12782
"Better go to the doctor '"""""|12782
I am a failure[BK][BK]I am so incompetent I cannot even die without fucking it up|12782
Intense disappointment.|12782
Coming out of a medically induced coma, I woke up fairly angry and was not happy with my parents being in the same room with me.|12782
I requested to speak with my friend Brittany, and eventually the anger left me.|12782
The next few days I felt numb and was tired of being in the hospital.|12782
I remember watching Benjamin Button.|12782
That's about all there is to tell.|12782
I was 17 and I overdosed on benzos.|12782
"I woke up thinking 'ah shit'"" and then my parents came home with Arby''s (which I have not eaten since) and I dizzily ate something, then drove myself to the ER, where they called my parents."|12782
My psychiatrist refused to see me, fired me then and there (around midnight) and they fed me charcoal and sent me home.|12782
[BK]My parents flipped.|12782
"[BK]I felt worse after than before."""|12782
When I was fourteen, I made a mistake I thought made me an irredeemable person and the only way to allow the people around me to live a normal life was to kill myself.|12782
I decided to go through with it when I was sitting in my dad's office.|12782
There was nothing around, so I stabbed myself in the wrists with a pencil, thinking it would pierce the vein and allow me to bleed out.|12782
One thing that stood out to me is that it did not hurt at all.|12782
Now if I even try to prick my wrist with a blunt pen it hurts, but when I had totally lost all my will to live, it did not at all.|12782
Once I realized I was unsuccessful, I began to feel even more useless since I could not even kill myself properly.|12782
This would lead to two years of crippling depression in which I came close to killing myself two other times.|12782
Most of the time it was sadness followed by relief.|12782
Sad that I needed to keep on going through the hell but also relief over it was not over.|12782
I tried a few times.|12782
I also got angry at myself for being a pussy and not do it properly.|12782
Today I am glad I never succeed.|12782
I still have my battles and sometimes my inner demons come back to haunt me, but I really am glad I am alive.|12782
In a few weeks it have been 2 years since I last hurt myself.|12782
I flat-lined, my first thought when I woke up was an angry 'fuck!|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I remember where I was."|12782
For the first time I had found peace.|12782
But now that I know what is waiting for me, it is a little easier to stick around.|12782
I am curious to see how this life plays out.|12782
"Curse you morbid curiosity!"""|12782
"I swear to god, the first thought that ran through my mind when I woke up after my first attempt (out of 5) was, 'That was super fucking unpleasant.'"""""|12782
I tried to take a bottle of pills once due to bullying and severe depression.|12782
"My first thought upon waking up was, 'Oh my god, someone actually cared enough to save me.'""."|12782
I am sorry that this is not really long or talking about things in depth, but I honestly do not remember much about the incident.|12782
I think I vomited a lot, though?|12782
I was about... 14 or 15, I think?|12782
Maybe 13?|12782
It was not a spur of the moment thing, it was not teenage angst or whatever a lot of people might call it.|12782
"It was true depression, which I had suffered from since about age 10 or so, and I still have to deal with it practically every moment of my life. """|12782
'I am going to have to explain this to my parents and things will never be the same.'|12782
[BK][BK]I was right; they are not.|12782
Got dizzy, went into the bathroom in my high school, threw up a lot, passed out for about 30 mins.|12782
"Woke up, cleaned up, thought 'hmm, could not even do that right.'"""|12782
and went to class.|12782
"Got in trouble for being late. """|12782
I cried.|12782
Because it meant i have to try harder next time.|12782
Tapering off the methadone as of today next two months really going to test me once I am off but I have got things I have to work on before in off of it completely|12782
I was still pretty numb when I woke up in the hospital.|12782
I had taken quite a bit of trazodone, but not as drastically as most pill stories I read.|12782
Every few minutes, if I was still conscious, I took another one.|12782
I do not even think my intention was to die, I just did not want to be conscious anymore.|12782
[BK][BK]I was dealing with heart issues around the same time, and already had a few recent ER visits for that.|12782
This visit just blended in with the others.|12782
I do not know what it was that tipped my mom off to call an ambulance, but afaik to this day she does not know that that time was different.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway, to actually answer the question, my first thoughts were mundane.|12782
*Well, I am not dead, so I guess I am not supposed to be.|12782
* Later I felt awful, specifically towards a friend of mine who had done something similar.|12782
I had copycatted and only realized it in hindsight.|12782

Oh god dammit.|12782
Commenting to find later|12782
Gotta try again[BK][BK]Bad thought thank goodness I do not have them anymore|12782
Where am I?|12782
I had no recollection of the previous 12 hours.|12782
Apparently I was in a hotel room with vomit and blood around me|12782
Something along the lines of 'What?|12782
How?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I had hung myself and right after I had drifted off I suddenly took a quick breathe and I was wide awake again."|12782
I realized I had grabbed the rope and pulled myself up a little bit to allow me to take one small breathe.|12782
I then untied the rope and cried for a while before going to the hospital.|12782
[BK][BK]I still think about it a lot, because I felt like I had no strength, and could not imagine how I had managed enough to pull myself up, outside of consciousness nonetheless.|12782
I just tell myself now that I was saved for a reason, and I have to figure it out.|12782
"Keeps me from trying again."""|12782
I have had many attempts in the past but the one that suck with me the most was [BK][BK]'NO NO NO NO NO NO.I have to get out of here.|12782
I cannot do this.|12782
I have to leave before anybody finds me awake.|12782
Maybe I can make it outside and throw myself in front of a car.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I just remember how absolutely desperate I was to die at that point."|12782
Like an animal backed into a corner I was terrified.|12782
I attempted by drug overdose so my body was still shut down.|12782
I was able to rip out my IV before a swarm of nurses came to hold me down.|12782
I was screaming at the top of my lungs and fighting as hard as a could (which honestly was not all that much).|12782
I was willing to hurt these people who were trying to help me just so I could go kill myself.|12782
"[BK][BK]Sometimes people do not realize how deep a person falls to reach the point of wanting to kill themselves. """|12782
"'fuck, I am gonna have to go to the hospital.'"""""|12782
'Eh, guess it did not work.|12782
Oh well, i should shower.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I had planned and made my preperations."|12782
I tried to overdose and set messages up so that I would not be rotting...  took the pills and laid down.|12782
Woke up the next day and this was my first thought.|12782
Guess it was a sign that I was not meant to die.|12782
[BK][BK]Friends did get the messages though and it started a lot of stuff.|12782
They called the cops on me later and then I got kicked off campus because the dean did not want a death on campus and felt I was high risk.|12782
Yeah, thanks.|12782
"[BK][BK]Have not attempted since."""|12782
"'Fuck why did they have to call my parents.'"""|12782
[BK]Woke up in the hospital handcuffed to a bed with a horrible headache but the worst part was the drama and attention my parents brought to the whole thing.|12782
If I could have chosen I would have just spent the week in the hospital with no one knowing and gone back to normal life after.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: First off thank you all for the support and understanding.|12782
It was kind of shocking for this comment to blow up the way it did.|12782
As for the restraints I was not clear.|12782
They were not actually handcuffs but more of a leather strap that tied my feet and wrists down to the bed.|12782
"Though they were incredibly tight to the point I was concerned they had caused serious damage but they have since healed."""|12782
I guess my paper is still due|12782
It took a while to have a conscious thought, I suppose from the seriousness of what had just happened.|12782
"The first thing I thought, aside from the confusion and disbelief of still breathing was both 'Godammit'"" and '""This is what you get for forgetting to clean the goddamned gun.'"""""|12782
Knew I would have to call someone to take me to the hospital to stitch up my wrists.|12782
Contemplated the shame I was about to experience doing that.|12782
Let the realization that I was a failure even in trying to kill myself wash over me.|12782
[BK][BK]That was a long time ago and I could not be happier I failed.|12782
The scars do cause me embarrassment, though.|12782
I tried to commit suicide via gunshot to the head when I had went through a horrible break up(she had a son I came to love) and lost my job all in the same day.|12782
I pulled trigger and the gun jammed.|12782
I actually felt like more of a failure at that point, when I noticed a picture of me and my ex gf's son at my desk.|12782
I realized I made that kids life different over the past three years and he changed me for the better.|12782
Then decided it was not worth it.|12782
Never told anyone this story, but glad to post here and get it off my chest.|12782
Fuck, I have to get ready for school.|12782
"'Damn.'"""|12782
I was pissed off that I was not dead.|12782
"Then I realized that since I would been willing to die, I was certainly ready and able to leave that relationship, so I did."""|12782
Relief.|12782
Plain and simple, relief.|12782
[BK][BK]I hate talking about this.|12782
It was so long ago, but it still pains me at times.|12782
I have never 100% moved on from those darkest of days, and it is a constant battle keeping the negative thoughts restrained and at bay.|12782
But, here goes... [BK][BK]In my teens, I had a few failed suicide attempts.|12782
The first few, I was not really dedicated to the cause.|12782
It was a true cry for help, and I knew it.|12782
I felt alone and abandoned even though I had little reason to.|12782
[BK][BK]Throughout my childhood I looked up to my dad.|12782
He was a hero of sorts.|12782
Now that I am in my 30''s, he is even more of a hero.|12782
The hardship he is overcome for the betterment of us kids and mum is astonishing.|12782
In my teens, it became apparent that my father and I had very different interests.|12782
[BK][BK]He was Rugby mad.|12782
I moved from rugby to soccer, then to golf  then dumped sports entirely to chase my passion of cars.|12782
Well, being a troublesome street racer shit bag more like.|12782
I was a tech geek.|12782
He had no interest in it.|12782
I was becoming a bit of a game geek, he had no interest in any of that.|12782
[BK][BK]Now that is probably not that big a deal to most.|12782
And I doubt it would have for me.|12782
He is a good guy, and a difference in interests would not have been allowed to tarnish a father son bond.|12782
I was the eldest son.|12782
So I was always a wee bit jealous thinking my younger brothers had it better than me.|12782
Further to that, I was the victim of ruthless small town bullying.|12782
[BK][BK]From when I first started primary school until after I had left high-school.|12782
The bullying never ended.|12782
I felt let down and abused by my peers.|12782
Through primary and then onto high-school,  I always had a small set of friends.|12782
However, primary friends went to boarding school when I went to high school.|12782
I had to start fresh.|12782
Eventually when I left high-school early because I was failing dismally because of the bullying, I did not really have friends outside of school.|12782
Again,  I was making new ones.|12782
This is where I feel in with the bad crowd.|12782
Really bad crowd.|12782
I was desperate to be accepted so I went along with their bullshit.|12782
Even though deep down I knew I was being used as I had money because I worked full time, and had a car meaning transport into the surrounding cities.|12782
It was a shitty time, and it further drove a wedge between myself, and the majority of the towns citizens around my age and a little older.|12782
It sucked.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway, one night some shit went down.|12782
I will not say what, because it was not good.|12782
Anyway, while I did not participate directly, I stood by and allowed it to happen.|12782
I wanted to stop it so bad,  but I did not.|12782
Fuck I regret it to this day.|12782
Eventually, we all got found out.|12782
Police interviews and all that shit.|12782
Got tasked to community service.|12782
As word went around town, the bullies that were a bit older than me, came down hard.|12782
I would get jumped by groups of them when walking home at night.|12782
Lost teeth to their fists.|12782
Some of my assailants were cousins.|12782
Fuck that hurt even more.|12782
Family members hating me enough to do that.|12782
I think the brother next down from me knew what was going on.|12782
We had always fought.|12782
Viciously at times.|12782
But during this period, he was just different.|12782
Noticeably so.|12782
Like he was trying to show love and be an awesome little brother, without making it obvious to anyone else.|12782
[BK][BK]Aside from him, I made sure no one knew how bad my life had become.|12782
I did not want to let my parents down thinking they had raised such a fucking loser.|12782
I would bottle it all up.|12782
From time to time it had all explode out violently.|12782
At school, then at pubs later in life.|12782
The switch would finally get flicked and I would explode.|12782
I would wind up getting hurt, but I always dealt some serious damage in the process.|12782
Was never proud of it.|12782
It was embarrassing.|12782
And for some of my bullies it added to the fun.|12782
The game became trying to set me off.|12782
How much prodding would it take until that looney cunt blows his top.|12782
Haha fun times right?|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway,  I am waffling on.|12782
I am not putting events together in a correct order etc.|12782
I guess the bonus of hitting this thread so late is its unlikely many will ever read this jumble of words.|12782
[BK][BK]First couple times, I did a shit job.|12782
Didn''t take enough pills.|12782
Didn''t tie the noose right.|12782
Survived the drive off the cliff.|12782
Until I came to my final attempt at ending my life.|12782
I was older now.|12782
Probably 18.|12782
I had made the concious decision that this is the day I leave this world, and no cunt is going to get in the way.|12782
The plan was to overdose, and that is exactly what I did.|12782
I took a ton of pills late one evening, and then walked around behind the wood shed at home, sat myself under a big Norfolk pine and let my mind begin to close down.|12782
I did not give a fuck.|12782
I did not want to leave any lasting legacy.|12782
I just wanted to check out.|12782
No fucking note.|12782
No bullshit.|12782
No final texts desperate to be talked out of it.|12782
Nope, fuck this world and fuck every bastard in it.|12782
[BK][BK]The final moments of consciousness I recall the porch light coming on.|12782
Dad coming outside and heading for my sleep out.|12782
I did not really care that he would find pill bottles.|12782
I was on my way out.|12782
(God what an asshole I was.|12782
I cannot believe at the time I could not even muster some emotion for what I was about to put my family through.|12782
I hate myself some times).|12782
Everything went black momentarily.|12782
I was checking out.|12782
Barely popping in and out of consciousness.|12782
I remember coming too for a bit.|12782
Dad calling out to mum.|12782
Sounding panicked.|12782
Blackness again.|12782
Mum and dad calling my name.|12782
Clearly emotional and panicked.|12782
Then, the moment that changed my life.|12782
Open my eyes for a moment.|12782
And dad comes clamoring through the shubs and grabs me.|12782
Tears rolling down his face.|12782
Can''t even remember what he said.|12782
I was fucked.|12782
"Something totally kiwi though along the lines of 'you fucking idiot, what have you done to yourself... come on mate'""."|12782
[BK][BK]That was the last thing I remembered until waking in the hospital.|12782
Mum and Dad right there by my side.|12782
I never shook that look on dad''s face.|12782
The emotion on it.|12782
That moment when I realised that he really did give a fuck about me.|12782
Loved me, just like all his sons.|12782
And that sinking sensation thinking how bloody close I came to realising it all too late.|12782
[BK][BK]I love my family.|12782
I know they all love me.|12782
While life can be a real struggle for me at times financially etc, I know I came through the pits of despair and came through the other side.|12782
Despite ALL of that, depression sneaks up on my a lot.|12782
I am in my 30''s now, and at times I still have to fight back the urges to just let the darkness take over, and finally check out.|12782
The main thing that prevents it is knowing how much pain I will put my family and girlfriend though if I did it.|12782
I do not want to find out there is an afterlife and have to live in the knowledge I destroyed the hearts of so many.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]Anyway, there is my story.|12782
I do not know why I told it on Reddit of all places.|12782
Just felt like it was time to get it all off my chest.|12782
I am so emotional now.|12782
Sad in a way.|12782
Feeling like a failure of sorts.|12782
But, also a little relieved.|12782
And proud looking back, and seeing how far I have come.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway  thanks reddit for allowing me the space to let that all out.|12782
I think I will look for somewhere on Reddit to talk about this stuff more regularly.|12782
I think it might be beneficial.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: an amazing redditor sent me a deep and heartfelt pm that has me feeling a bit better.|12782
Talking about such things brings me back to a darker lonely place I try to avoid wherever possible.|12782
You, the awesome people of Reddit, make it much easier for myself and others to open up about such thoughts and emotions, thanks to your genuinely caring responses.|12782
So, thanks guys.|12782
"You''re amazing <3"""|12782
"'I cannot do anything right'"""""|12782
'Oh shit oh shit oh shit im still alive im in pain, a bloody mess, still wasted and my car is wrecked how can i kill myself asap in the middle of a fucking field.|12782
":"""|12782
I do not want to tell my parents.|12782
[BK][BK]I was terrified of them knowing.|12782
I was so ashamed of what I would done.|12782
But I had this huge relief that I had not succeeded.|12782
I did tell my parents, and they were incredibly loving and supportive.|12782
"'I want my mum and dad'"""""|12782
I woke up???|12782
And .|12782
.|12782
.|12782
now I have to go to fucking work.|12782
Luckily my only attempt, but I did continue to cut myself for about 7 more years.|12782
But, I have managed to make it out from drowning in my own head without drugs or real therapy.|12782
Sometimes, you just need to survive .|12782
.|12782
.|12782
I realized that no one gave a shit if I lived or died as I spent almost three days out of it, puking my guts up only managing to stay alive because I ended up passing out on my side and did not drown in vomit.|12782
No one ever checked in on me, only complained about the smell when I came out of my room to go to the hospital.|12782
I was told to stop being a whiny bitch about everything when I told her what I did and to knock it off.|12782
She then left to go visit her pedophile husband in jail because that is what you do when your grandkid tries to kill themselves.|12782
Oh man...|12782
I was very suicidal and had a few near death overdoses.|12782
One I woke up and pulled my iv's out and walked off, I got pretty far and got arrested and sent to psych.|12782
That was memorable because I got down the street.|12782
[BK][BK]One was very surreal.|12782
I woke up in hospital and the strangest feeling come over me.|12782
I slowly came back online starting with hearing and sight, then I could move my feet and hands.|12782
I was so shocked to be alive, not in a bad way at all.|12782
Sort of dumbfounded but relieved because I had insane night terrors.|12782
You're memory of events can trick you, especially with drugs, but in the darkness I felt something pushing me, trying to drown me and I could not breath but I was fighting it and did not have strength.|12782
Like a dream when you cannot clench your fist.|12782
I felt myself dying in the realest way, i was in the complete darkness, just 'okay, heart, beat, breath, you can do it, beat again and breath and you you will be fine' for what felt like days.|12782
It felt like 50 years, I swear on my life.|12782
I knew I was surrounded by lots of people in my house at one point.|12782
I was awake and talking to a doctor for half an hour before I touched my head and realized I had stitches all over and I had blood all over me.|12782
They'd cleaned it off my head and chest but sort of smeared it all over, I saw myself in the mirror and it was like a horror movie.|12782
Just in the sense it was so shocking and did not feel real and the stitches just looked like make up.|12782
[BK][BK]It still does not feel real and I do not have too many people to talk about it with, without sounding like a kook.|12782
I will open up more about my life one day but it is too soon and it got so dark for me for a little bit.|12782
[BK][BK]I did not start learning to love myself until the very moment I lay dying, what happened that day and in the months following was nothing short of life changing for me.|12782
It made me a believer in some kind of love energy that most people seem oblivious to, I feel enlightened in a way.|12782
I rearranged my priorities and I have been healthy and good to people around me for the last two years.|12782
[BK][BK]I am really happy with myself but I have a lot of issues, you would never guess though, I am doing really well and look great.|12782
I feel a lot more alienated from society, just in that I felt something and feel I know a secret I cannot share.|12782
I want to help other people but you cannot make them feel.|12782
Sometimes I feel like some sort of little godling and wonder how I have been so lucky my whole life, skirting death.|12782
I think when you grow up surrounded by tragedy, it is easier to find beauty in life, so I cannot say this is due to my experience but a reflection on my life when I got sober.|12782
[BK][BK]Ive got tears in my eyes.|12782
Anyone can do it.|12782
Anyone can change their life around and you do not need to die!|12782
You will find love or you will find a way and I promise, if you want to die young you can change your attitude/behavior and start to feel younger everyday!|12782
You'll hope to die younger than you are!|12782
Life can be meaningless but it doesnt mean it is not beautiful and you are not a tiny piece of this energy we all share.|12782
Most of us will die screaming, no matter how nice we are on this earth, is the reality.|12782
You do not get to choose your death, I have probably been saved for a much slower/violent one, but I will sure as fuck use newfound control over my life to choose to smile, maybe if I do not even feel like it, and try to be good while I can.|12782
This thing on earth is too short to be a shitty example.|12782
[BK][BK]I have lost a lot of friends to this darkness and I wish they knew that the darker it got, the higher the potential.|12782
You do not see the good without the bad, when you have seen the worst you you will be able to find happiness very easily in the things and people around you if you can learn to bend your willpower and change your ways.|12782
If you try with all your heart, you will come out a well rounded person.|12782
You will be told this by people close to you, which feels so relieving.|12782
When you take care of yourself, people take care of you.|12782
When you put good energy out and trust in yourself and your decisions good things will just flow into your life.|12782
[BK][BK]I elaborated on the question, I wanted to tell a bit of my story in case someone out there is looking for some hope.|12782
A lot of the responses were pretty negative and these people are still afraid, we are all better than that.|12782
I do not think I had thoughts in words, I was just really sick and in a lot of pain.|12782
I was dehydrated too, so I had to get fluids from an IV through my hand.|12782
I had blankets piled up on me and I was still freezing.|12782
My hand was super cold too, I have bad veins, but I could not see them at all.|12782
It was weird.|12782
I also yelled at a nurse who tried getting me up to take a urine sample.|12782
It really was not the thought after but during dying.|12782
It's terrifying being on the precipice of death,  - 10 out of 10 would not do it again.|12782
"'Fuck I am still here'"" [BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]I almost do not want to share this because I do not know if it is helpful for people who are going through it right now."|12782
But I have seen and read so many accounts of people who changed their mind when it seemed to be too late, or realised all their problems were insignificant once they were almost dead.|12782
But that did not happen to me.|12782
"[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]When I started vomiting blood and bile, all I could think was '""I really hope I am not throwing up the pills right now'""."|12782
I also felt disgusting and ashamed, but I did not want to live and I did not change my mind.|12782
When I woke up I was covered in blood (some from vomit, but a lot from my arms and legs which I would absolutely shredded with a blade.)|12782
there was sick all over the floor and in my hair, and my clothes and face were wet with tears.|12782
I was a mess, and I felt like I would fucked up my life in every possible way, and I have never felt so disappointed or disgusted with myself than when I properly realised it had not worked.|12782
[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]And honestly I would have loved that to be a wake up call or the moment I changed, but it was not.|12782
I felt that same disgust for some years afterwards.|12782
To me, that was confirmation that I would never be happy, and that I would never settle into life in the way that everyone else seemed to.|12782
I just accepted that I would never be happy, and that I would never stop wanting to die.|12782
I cannot really explain why I thought this.|12782
I just believed there was something inherently wrong with me, an illness, or something about who I am as a person, which meant I would always feel suicidal.|12782
[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]If I could go back and meet this younger version of myself, I would give her such a huge hug.|12782
But I do not really know what I would tell her.|12782
I do not know what it was that made everything finally click.|12782
I do not know what is happening in my brain now that was not happening then.|12782
I think I just finally realised that it is down to me.|12782
Of course you cannot think your way out of depression, but you can learn how to cope with it better, and eventually how to combat it.|12782
Over time I completely changed my attitude.|12782
Depression still plagued me, it was still there in my head, but I found ways to make it quieter, and ways to make it hurt less.|12782
Very, very, slowly, I even found ways to be happy.|12782
I realised that my happiness was my responsibility, and I could not just sit there waiting for depression to leave me.|12782
And I can honestly say now that I am a very happy person, I enjoy life, and even during stressful times I am ok and I can dea with it while still being happy in myself.|12782
It took a long time to get here but it was the most worthwhile thing I ever worked on.|12782
Being happy is pretty much the best thing you you will ever be.|12782
"[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]There''s a quote I found during that time which I really like: '""no matter how far from the truth we are led by histrionics and lies, the truly, objectively beautiful remains untainted.'"""|12782
I thought about that a lot and I still do.|12782
No matter how bad things get, no matter what awful things my brain throws at me, there is objective beauty in this world which can never be taken away.|12782
I worked really hard to see it everywhere.|12782
Flowers, the moon, my cat, my mum, strawberries, anything at all.|12782
I just reminded myself that to me, these things will always be beautiful, and my depression could not stop that.|12782
Eventually it was less hard work to find beautiful things.|12782
I saw them everywhere, and I still do.|12782
"[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]Another is from Oscar Wilde '""the only reason for a useless thing is that one admires it intensely."|12782
"All art is quite useless.'"""|12782
When I first discovered that quote I believed myself to be useless.|12782
This quote made me smile.|12782
Everything here is useless really.|12782
The only point is to love things and sometimes to let them love you.|12782
[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]I am happy to be alive.|12782
Im happy to be here with all these beautiful things and people.|12782
If anyone out there is having a difficult time with suicidal thoughts, or depression, please know that it can get better.|12782
Please know that I love you very much and you are a beautiful thing that I am proud to share a planet with.|12782
[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]**EDIT:** I really did not expect such a huge response to this.|12782
I am honestly overwhelmed by it and I do not know what to say.|12782
To know that a really awful time in my life has ended up helping people a little bit is really humbling.|12782
Those years of my life were pretty much wasted, but now it feels like they were worth something.|12782
Thank you so much to the people who shared your stories with me.|12782
I will be responding to everyone personally because this has all affected me a lot.|12782
You really are all amazing, and it made me cry to see so much love being shared in the comments.|12782
It''s so lovely that such a negative premise has created so much positivity.|12782
Thank you all!|12782
[BK][BK]&nbsp;[BK][BK]**EDIT AGAIN:** I am sorry to keep adding to this but I really am blown away by all of this.|12782
Thank you for the anonymous gold.|12782
"I really hope that means it helped you in some way. """|12782
That I would never try it again.|12782
Years later, I want to try again anyway|12782
"'this made a very difficult situation much worse'""[BK][BK]I was hospitalized and had to quit my job after missing too much work."|12782
"this was about 6 years ago and I have made a pretty strong recovery."""|12782
I used to have a horrible cocaine and alcohol addiction.|12782
Add into that an extremely emotionally abusive gf at the time and it was a true recipe for disaster.|12782
I lived in Hudson County NJ at the time, which is right across the river from NYC(I lived half way up between the Lincoln tunnel and GWB).|12782
We would get high and drunk, fight, and then I would wander around all night.|12782
[BK][BK]I made the walk up to the GWB several times but always turned back.|12782
Well after one particularly bad marathon binge and subsequent fight I decided this was it.|12782
I grabbed the bottle of Jack, stopped by my dealer for one last gram, and walked upto the bridge.|12782
The whole time I am sniffing, drinking and cryingncuz all I can hear is her telling me how pathetic I am and how she never loved me.|12782
[BK][BK]I start walking across the bridge, and how I was not stopped idk(I walked past some cops on the footpath and I know I looked like k did not have all my with about me).|12782
So as I am walking across I stop at the spot where I was going to jump.|12782
I take one last blast and as I am leaning on the rail crying my eyes out I see someone out of my peripherals.|12782
It was someone on an early morning jog.|12782
They''re coming up on me and all I hear is 'Don''t do it man.|12782
"It''s not worth it.'"""|12782
[BK][BK]The person did not even break stride.|12782
Didn''t stop to talk.|12782
Didn''t offer anything else besides those passing words.|12782
And that is when it hit me.|12782
It''s not worth it.|12782
If I could just get my shit show of a life together it would not be worth it.|12782
[BK][BK]I went home and passed out due to all the alcohol and exhaustion.|12782
I woke up and made major changes in my life.|12782
That still ended up being the last gram of coke I ever bought.|12782
I broke up with my gf.|12782
I quit my job a week later and moved out of a heavily toxic area I lived in my whole life(dealers every, easy access to drugs 24/7).|12782
"That was over 3 years ago and I am still coke free and doing better in life than I had ever thought possible """|12782
Time to horde pills for the next try.|12782
[BK][BK]Edit: I have not been suicidal for more than 10 years and my mental health is being successfully managed.|12782
'You know what, that was a pretty dumb idea.|12782
"Fuck this, I am going to start fighting.'"""""|12782
"'Hope I do it better next time'""[BK][BK]Followed by[BK][BK]'""Huh."|12782
"I am not sure how I feel right now'""[BK][BK]But I am doing much better now!"|12782
":D"""|12782
That was the worst decision I have ever made and this is the luckiest moment of my life.|12782
I truly believed that I was not successful because I was not ready to die, I have so much more life to live and so much more to do with my life.|12782
I am thankful that I was unsuccessful and I cherish every moment I have now, even the crappy ones.|12782
'What do you mean I owe $20,000???|12782
"'""[BK]Americas 72 hour hold policy is such crap."|12782
"You get held in a hospital against your will, and then they bill you for it afterwards. """|12782
'Oh thank God.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I had suddenly realized that I was not ready to die just yet."|12782
When my hands were shaking so badly from the drug withdrawal that I could not even tie the noose, I was so glad I was incapable of killing myself.|12782
It felt like God was saving me because I could not trust myself to keep myself alive at that point.|12782
[BK][BK]That was almost seven years ago.|12782
"I am so glad I am still here."""|12782
"'Oh thank God.'"""""|12782
Never told anyone about this before, but I guess threads like this are a good place to kind of put it all out without freaking out friends or family.|12782
[BK][BK]One night I would decided that enough was enough stress from work and school.|12782
I put my earbuds in, put on some soothing music, and tied a plastic grocery bag around my head with some rubber bands.|12782
I was so out of it that I did not notice the bag had a tear in it.|12782
I ended up falling asleep from a fair bit of Xanax I had taken, but then I woke up the next day feeling even worse.|12782
I sat around the house for the rest of that day feeling like the biggest failure.|12782
How could I explain to my parent on what happened (I was only 8).|12782
From then on I have promised myself not to do it again... Not for me, but for the ones who loves me.|12782
I struggle with it once in a while.|12782
I would not let myself cheat life and take the easy way out.|12782
Been alive for 20 years now just at least 80 more to go :).|12782
I had a panic attack.|12782
I was also very drunk.|12782
But very quickly once I realized that I was under an involuntary psychiatric hold, the sole thought in my head was getting out.|12782
"Most recently: 'Being uncooperative with the police now will make it harder for me to try again in a couple days'"" as two officers approached me."|12782
[BK][BK][BK]My first time I was 12 and the cliff I went to throw myself off was not anywhere near as high as I had thought, so I just found a piece of glass on the ground and cut myself up with that.|12782
I remember laughing as I did it because I did not have to worry about any kind of bloodborne diseases or infections because I would be dead soon anyway.|12782
It was not sharp enough to do much real damage, but I did not really get that so I went and found a bush to lay under to wait.|12782
When I woke up I figured I might be able to thirst myself to death and just waited longer.|12782
"Eventually I got bored and went home."""|12782
A set of deep brown eyes in a round face, a small child about 6 looking at me, smiling, with long brown hair tumblng all over, laughing as she clutched this small white stuffed rabbit.|12782
[BK][BK]My little sister died in a miscarriage, that is what I always thought she would have looked like.|12782
[BK][BK]Those eyes keep me going more than some shrink ever will.|12782
Anger, confusion, like I could not do anything right.|12782
Part of me was also relieved but another part was still anxious and guilty that I was still alive.|12782
'This is gonna be a bitch to clean up.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I will share my experiences as candidly as possible."|12782
[BK][BK]I have only tried to go in a private way, if that makes sense.|12782
No gory mess, no hanging, no splat.|12782
I know if I survived that, that overwhelming felling would be unbearable.|12782
[BK][BK]The first thing that always comes to my mind is the overwhelming feeling of shame, humiliation, and failure.|12782
I had one job and I fucked up.|12782
I wake up and this feeling washes over me and I lay there shaking, crying, and ripping away at my skin.|12782
After shaking comes the vomiting.|12782
Anything and everything comes up.|12782
I beg myself to keep it in.|12782
I am convinced that if it stays in, perhaps even for a few moments longer that I will die.|12782
I beg and plea, covering my mouth and forcing myself to keep swallowing.|12782
Just swallow, breathe, swallow, breathe....|12782
I hold my breath.|12782
30 seconds go by and I begin to feel pain, 60 seconds and my face is turning red, 2 minutes the pain is becoming unbearable.|12782
I am determined to keep it in.|12782
3 minutes, 4 minues I break.|12782
I gasp for air and continue swallowing.|12782
At some point the act of swallowing becomes too laborious, too painful to continue that everything comes gushing out.|12782
In that moment I wish I had more resolve, to continue swallowing, persisting through the tearing of my throat and the blood trickling into my stomach.|12782
I wish enough of the pills and alcohol were absorbed into my body to finish the job.|12782
I have struggled enough to get here, I want it all to end.|12782
I lay soaked in a pool of my own blood, bile, and tears.|12782
I think if I can lick up even one pill I will die.|12782
Eventually more gushes out of me.|12782
I am defeated.|12782
I have failed.|12782
A second wave of shame washes o er me as I lay weeping, begging every god that I have never believed in to have mercy and end my suffering.|12782
Every minute crawls by, eventually turning into an unknown number of hours before I am even capable of moving.|12782
I wake up again.|12782
Every joyous memory floods through my mind.|12782
I smile.|12782
I am thankful I have failed.|12782
I think of times I have spend at work or with friends, times that I have laughed and smiled.|12782
I think of times that have been rough and I realize that there is some way to get through it, there is something that is perhaps better at the end of the road.|12782
Maybe it will not be better, maybe if will just be over and that will suffice.|12782
A few months, perhaps years later I am at the beginning again.|12782
It''s maybe that I do not want to die, it is that dying would solve everything.|12782
I would not have to deal with anything, I would not have to go through this again.|12782
[BK][BK]For those that might be wondering.|12782
I have attempted 17 times.|12782
I have been taking medications for the past 19 months, seeing a psychologist and phychiatrist monthly.|12782
I might go through electro-convulsive therapy in the future.|12782
I have not attempted since seeking help.|12782
[BK][BK]To anyone else who is suffering, all I can say is that things will get better.|12782
Not today, not tomorrow, maybe not for a few years.|12782
They will not get better instantly.|12782
It is a slow progress towards ''better'', whatever that is for you.|12782
There will inevitably be slip ups and falls along the journey, but you will get there.|12782
When you are in a suicidal and major depressive state remember that whatever circumstances you are going through can be resolved or taken care of in one form or another.|12782
You are not weak.|12782
Seeking help is not weakness.|12782
It is simply seeking help.|12782
It is acknowledging you need help beyond what you can provide yourself with.|12782
If you choose to take medication, it will take a very long time.|12782
Not only do you have to find a medication that works well for you, with minimal to zero side effects, you have to get the right dosage.|12782
You might have to try upwards of 10 medications, and perhaps even combinations.|12782
It takes time, you have to slowly build up the dosage.|12782
Believe in yourself.|12782
Believe that some day you can get to a place that is ''better'', whatever that means for you.|12782

So.|12782

"Debt."""|12782
Tried to kill myself after I found out what my father did.|12782
[BK][BK]Jumped off this local factory, roughly 6-8 stories.|12782
[BK][BK]The second I jumped, everything in my life was resovable, everything was normal, I could see how I was gonna do this and that.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up in a hospital bed 1 week later, I two broken legs, my arms were completely fucked but my chest/head were untouched even though I tried to go head first.|12782
[BK][BK]My first thought was me wanting to get up and go explore the world, go do shit I had not even thought of before.|12782
Either way, I am not proud of what I did that day, but I am glad it happen.|12782
'Oh shit, oh shit.|12782
I cannot feel my arm.|12782
Fuck, my cough could probably kill mosquitos right now.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Then after the ICU... [BK][BK]'""Bloody fucking useless piece of shit you are."|12782
Why cannot I just die?!|12782
Now I am going to have to bullshit my way for the next few months pretending to be better.|12782
"Have to plan better next time, and for god''s sakes, just use some rope!'"""""|12782
I doubt anyone will see this now, but if you ARE reading this, I want you to KNOW that the world is a better place for having you in it.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]I am glad you are all still here with us|12782
Its really odd tbh.|12782
I went in hoping i wouldnt wake up.|12782
But 2 days later i did.|12782
I guess my first reaction was 'well shit what time is it ' my internal clock was fucked up haha.|12782
This will probably be buried, but while I have had suicidal urges for as long as I can remember, I did not make an attempt until I was 32.|12782
That was in December.|12782
I really did not want to fail or to make a mess, or have to go to the hospital if I were found.|12782
These were all things I considered because even in suicide, I over think things.|12782
[BK][BK]I did not have a good place for hanging, and since I am quite overweight, I did not want to risk the mess of decapitation.|12782
I do not own a gun, and that would also be messy.|12782
Poison is usually ineffective, and I knew I would probably get scared and call for help.|12782
Gas is dangerous and could harm others.|12782
[BK][BK]I finally decided on aphxiation through helium.|12782
Most people who choose to go this way have to do a lot of research and planning to be effective.|12782
If I had had to leave my house, I knew I would lose the nerve.|12782
Because of my line of work, I was able to cobble together an apparatus that I thought would work in about an hour.|12782
[BK][BK]I knew my husband would be devastated, but my mind convinced me that he would be better off without me.|12782
He was getting quite handsome, he has an adorable dog, and I felt like women would be throwing themselves at him if I were not in the picture.|12782
[BK][BK]I felt like I failed my clients, and even though I knew a lot of people and was even a little famous in my line of work, I looked through my contacts and could not think of anyone who I would feel comfortable calling.|12782
I look somewhat professional and can put on an incredibly happy face, but that has only been through years of training and enormous mental effort.|12782
I had come to the point where I just could not pretend anymore.|12782
[BK][BK]A sick brain can rationalize anything.|12782
Anyway, when I actually made my attempt, I choose to do it in my garage so that my husband would not have to find me on our couch.|12782
I got everything set up, turned on the gas and very quickly faded into darkness.|12782
[BK][BK]When I came to, for one of the first times in my life, I was not thinking.|12782
I was just feeling.|12782
I felt terrible; my head ached and I was drenched in sweat.|12782
I stumbled inside, threw up and just sat on the floor of the bathroom.|12782
My legs did not want to work, but I forced myself.|12782
[BK][BK]The my phone rang.|12782
It was one of my clients calling to make sure I would be there in 3 hours.|12782
That put me on a mission.|12782
Somehow I decided that I could do my job and I started preparing to do so, even though I felt like shit.|12782
I took a shower, got dressed and did everything else I had to do for work.|12782
[BK][BK]I told my husband later that night and he is helped me to get help.|12782
I was really careful to choose method that did not leave physical scars, but my body was achy for about a week.|12782
Id never been actually treated for depression, but I had been non-compliant for several months for a thyroid condition.|12782
I really dislike going to the doctor, so I would avoid going at all costs, which was why I just stopped taking my medicine when it ran out.|12782
[BK][BK]I actually just recently found a word that describes how I was feeling: acedia.|12782
Its basically a 4th century monastic word for 1st world problems.|12782
Part of my despair had been guilt for my own success, and the feeling that I was not doing enough for the world, since I knew I was capable of more.|12782
It's a hard headspace to describe, but it is nice to know there is a word for it.|12782
[BK][BK]My doctor got me back on my medication and prescribed me zoloft.|12782
Nothing really changed, but my husband and I started making little changes.|12782
We started walking every night, eating healthier and talking to each other.|12782
The biggest thing that happened was that I actually wanted to take care of myself.|12782
I started looking for a more meaningful job.|12782
[BK][BK]The biggest change for me happened when I started doing yoga and meditating.|12782
I never have been very successful at turning off my brain, but there really is something to the breathing patterns that works.|12782
I need to do this alone, to music to be effective, but I am incredibly energized and focused by doing this.|12782
I am not saying that yoga is right for everyone, but I really believe that connecting with my body has helped immensely.|12782
I have lost about 20 lbs so far with no real effort, but I still have a long ways to go.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyway, this is long.|12782
But my real lesson that I learned was that it is okay to ask for help.|12782
I am incredibly fortunate to have a lot of freedom, so I need to take advantage of that and do more.|12782
I am making big plans again and it feels amazing.|12782
I might fail, but nothing that happens to me can be any worse than what I tried to do to myself.|12782
Yes, I failed at suicide, but it was almost like I killed that inner voice that was constantly telling me that I was worthless and did not deserve what I had in life.|12782
[BK][BK]I know this is long, but I hope it helps someone else.|12782
TL:DR failed suicide, got help and a new outlook on life.|12782
Edit-spelling|12782
I had just turned 17 around the time I attempted.|12782
My parents were out of town, so I figured it would somehow be easier for everyone that way.|12782
Soon after I failed I got a call from my parents.|12782
I was a mess and could not answer it right away so I let it ring, but the timing of it really tore me up and I got so sick feeling I puked.|12782
Not exactly my first thought, but looking back this is what stands out the most to me.|12782
"'how am I not even hurt?'"""|12782
"[BK][BK]I put my car into a wall going 70 Mph."""|12782
A friend of mine killed herself on friday morning.|12782
Shes been trying for 5 months.|12782
We did so much to try to help her..|12782
But it still feels like we did nothing.|12782
She succeeded and we could not save her.|12782
Really this is the first time I have to deal with such a huge emotional guilt, and I have no idea how to do it.|12782
I do not want to kill myself at all, but I feel broken and I do not know what to do.|12782
Sorry if this is out of topic.|12782
"'Damn, my stomach hurts.'"""|12782

[BK][BK]I cannot say I am happy that I did not succeed, but i also dont regret failing.|12782
Im just ok....|12782
Which is more than I could say then so...|12782
"Positivity?"""|12782
 I am late here but yeah this is my story.|12782
I did not really do straight up suicide attempt, I first went for a full walk for some part of the city from morning to night and came back at night.|12782
I do not know why but I just walked the whole way looking at everything, the people and the next day I took some clothes and some money I saved up and got on a bus.|12782
This is a 3rd world country so I could not really escape to  another state.|12782
My plan was to go to wild part of the world and just die there while enjoying some moments of my life left to me.|12782
[BK][BK]After almost 200 miles away I got off in a middle of nowhere and lied to the driver my family had estate around and just went to the forest.|12782
I had really warm clothes and it was spring almost early into summer.|12782
So I got to the forest and enjoyed the sense of being alone where no one could see me you know?|12782
It felt so good and scary but at the same time... so free.|12782
[BK][BK]I walked about 5 miles off the road and came by a small waterstream in the forest, just put off my backpack.|12782
I had a very scarce food, embarassed to admit I only brought a premade food and ate a food while we were going on the bus (bathroom break with restaurant) and only a big can of Pringles with a jug of Cola.|12782
[BK]I did not plan to live there forever so it was fairly simple, I brought something I would enjoy and not last for long.|12782
That day I set up my things and ate half of my food and just sang like a crazy person doing stupid things because no one could see or hear me.|12782
[BK]I enjoyed myself, I masturbated and just did everything you could do.|12782
After some time, this things have decayed I felt very alone, forest was silent.|12782
I was not afraid of the night but that terrible silence actually got weird, summer was not exactly there yet so bugs were not out and birds seem to have avoided me.|12782
[BK][BK]I went onto different set of enjoyment, the subtle feeling of where I am and the raw nature that I am in.|12782
Felt good to be honest, I got my big winter jacket out and used it as a blanket and my backpack as a pillow and slept.|12782
Woke up in the morning at like dawn, it was fucking cold and I was all soaked up in damp on face and my pants, my winter jacket held out most though.|12782
I knew it was not enough and planned to make some kind of roof just so I will not get damp because I hate that feeling.|12782
[BK][BK]I had nothing to do, so I just tried to wake myself up a little and ate the remainder of my food and went on for the shelter.|12782
I thought I could just build roof but abandoned that idea because damp would be everywhere so I made a little shelter out of dead branch, dry plant, whatever it is I am not sure what its called in English.|12782
I got a really shitty shelter done and slept in it, it was pretty good.|12782
But that day I was thorougly bored and just went to look for the landscape.|12782
I went onto this mountain range and inbetween one of those I saw a fucking deer, I was really lucky but I startled it and it went up like a bastard and run like hell after being still for awkward long time.|12782
I felt good seing those things but I was kinda worried about wolf now but at the same time thought it was better if I die faster.|12782
I went back but could not find my shelter for few hours then came in at night and slept.|12782
[BK][BK]I was so hungry the next day waking up, my Cola was out and I drank from the waterstream.|12782
So bored, no wolf.|12782
Thought about hanging myself but I did not bring any rope or something I could use.|12782
I had a belt but I did not think about it a time cause I am an idiot.|12782
[BK][BK]I lived there for about a week and a half then when I was fucking around I got spotted by a jeep.|12782
It was apparently an equalievent of ranger in here searching for me with the police.|12782
My parents had posted search notice to police and reported it.|12782
Apparently they searched for bus station and my equal of Social Security was recorded there on a bus, tracked the driver down and asked me where I got off.|12782
They had been searching for 3 days till they found me.|12782
[BK][BK]Coming back was the most shittiest feeling, I was kinda happy to be back but I wanted to die peacefully there in the forest.|12782
I did not like how they would be scared and shit.|12782
I met up with them in a bout an hour after the spotting.|12782
They were in their car searching as well, got a mouthful and rage.|12782
I got on the car and we had the longest fucking conversation ever.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyways we kinda got the commonground after that, I was an underachiever but when I came back I took some time off and worked a little then went full time.|12782
I have a better life now, I live alone and I love it.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]Sorry if that was a long one, but that is what happened to me.|12782
It was my twisted attempt of suicide or just dying peacefully while enjoying my time.|12782
I did not think much of hanging there or otherwise I would have but yeah.|12782
I just thought I would die of starving, but I guess you can do much fkin more when you are in the wild.|12782
[BK]I did not eat anything after the day 3, went on water and some plants that looked safe at the time ( but I think I just ate it to feel something other than grumbling)[BK]|12782
"'No one is here.'"""|12782
[BK]  [BK]To this day I have never had anyone visit me while I was in the hospital.|12782
"I was angry that they saved my life when no one cared about me."""|12782
Fuck.|12782
"'I just...want...out. '"""|12782
That was the first thing I said when I woke up in the hospital.|12782
"And then I broke down crying for a couple hours. """|12782
Pretty much just more ashamed.|12782
I was bullied severely for the way I looked and was raised and I tried to hang myself but the rope broke.|12782
So that just confirmed I was a fat cow who is hair was like a horse and all the other mean shit people said about me.|12782
Much like the top post right now, it was not like something clicked right after that that made me feel better.|12782
After my dad died my freshman year of high school and the news spread, people stopped bullying me and just ignored me instead.|12782
And after lashing out for awhile I got over it, identified that my depression was environmental and got the fuck out of state as soon as I graduated high school.|12782
No regrets.|12782
2 time survivor the first time after i failed it threw me deeper into depression andmade me feel like a fuck up useless person who cant even kill himself.|12782
So about a month later i apptempted a second time.|12782
Ended up in a coma for a week and when i woke i acutally felt depressed but not as much.|12782
This time i felt like i can get through this  so i put myself into rehab and after 5 years im happier then i ever been|12782
'Ow.|12782
Fuck.|12782
That was stupid.|12782
"Why am I still alive?'"""|12782
Followed by lots of moaning and telling the paramedics that I loved them.|12782
It was not until I woke up from my multiple surgeries that I loved life.|12782
I smiled for a month straight and was apparently super nice to everyone caring for me, even while pissing myself.|12782
It also helped that sooooo many people visited me in the hospital, most of them being people I would never have thought cared about me that much, if at all.|12782
"One person''s life is more important than a lot of people think."""|12782
I passed out and I figured I would never wake up then I did and my head was buzzing and my vision was blurry then I spent all night and next day vomiting|12782
I did not think of a phrase, I was simply bummed out.|12782
As I came to, my internal monologue was like 'no, no, no, no, I fucked it up, this cannot be!|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I was sure I took a lethal dose."|12782
As background, I was undergoing negligent psychiatric treatment against the advice and will of my wonderful psychologist.|12782
I took several pills, the main were a large blue one to normalize an anomaly in brain waves caused by irreversible brain damage to the right front lobe.|12782
The other two were an antidepressant and clonazepam.|12782
I was very depressed for many valid reasons, going through the darkest point in my life, and therapy was giving me a glimmer of hope that the medicines provided by my apathetic toad of a psychiatrist extinguished.|12782
[BK][BK]After a long period of slowly losing what I liked about myself and one too many disillusions in my love life, I decided the daily struggle would not improve significantly and I was no longer willing to put myself through it.|12782
I fancied the idea of the ultimate rest for my weary soul, the end of my sorrow through my autumn leaf landing.|12782
[BK]I was taking a massive dose of 8 of the largest clonazepam pills available per day, but that night I took more or less 70 pills, all that I had left at the time.|12782
With every nightly dose, I felt an overwhelming cloak of lethargy lull me to slumber within minutes.|12782
I felt it so much stronger than any time before and I dedicated my brief next minutes to cherishing that which had been good in life and making peace with my departing.|12782
[BK][BK]Around 18 hours later, I woke up still immersed in deep mental fog though acknowledging my continued existence, and it took several minutes before I was able to formulate my first thoughts about it.|12782
[BK][BK]Immediately after, I ceased taking all medications against all medical orders (I know now it was quite dangerous to quit them like that, but to be fair it would not have made a difference at the time, more encouragement even), only to endure several torturous weeks of adapting my body to live without benzodiazepines.|12782
[BK][BK]Today I do not feel the depression I felt.|12782
I do feel I have a depressive personality beyond my social mask, one that dwells deep inside and I allow only for myself to see.|12782
I have never felt I belong in this world, even in times of joy when I felt loved and generally in plenitude.|12782
There was always this ghost gnawing at me, occasionally reminding myself of its permanence.|12782
I simply do not belong here.|12782
[BK][BK]But I have found certain focus that keeps me going.|12782
In this thread is an amazing post that invites us to recall the inherent and objective beauty in this world.|12782
"This is a wise thought, and though I probably could not have simply externalized it in any manner, let alone such an effective one, I believe that too is what keeps me alive today.  """|12782

I had high grades at school, a group of friends, parents who were supportive, a job that had great coworkers... On the outside, I pretended that everything was fine.|12782
No one ever knew or suspected that at the end of the day, I was kept awake at night  by thoughts of how useless I was, how I was a disappointment, how nobody would care if I disappeared, how great it would be to die in my sleep...|12782
I would lather, rinse and repeat the daily cycle of pretending and self loathing for months until I made a plan.|12782

[BK][BK][BK]My little sister showed up.|12782
I do not know how.|12782
Or why.|12782
I told her I was sick.|12782
She stayed in my room with me and brought me a bowl to puke in.|12782
I felt like a sack of shit for putting her in that position, but was happy that it was going to be the end.|12782
I kept puking and and drifting, puking and drifting waiting and waiting.|12782
[BK][BK]At 10 years old she called 911 to get me help after she noticed all the empty bottles and cuts all over my wrists.|12782
[BK][BK]The next bit is fuzzy: the ambulance picked me up, I was taken to a hospital, one of my parents'' friends who worked in The ER recognized me and called them...|12782
I was shocked and amazed that I was not dead yet.|12782
I kept telling them not to bother calling my parents, because I would be dead soon anyway.|12782
[BK][BK]My parents came and were devastated.|12782
I drifted.|12782
I guess they pumped my stomach and whatever else they had to - because I woke up.|12782
What the hell was I still doing here.|12782
[BK][BK]I finally told my family my thoughts, how it had been months and they did not notice.|12782
I wanted to pretend to seek help long enough so that I could make another plan and try again.|12782
Until my sister walked in the room and threw her arms around me.|12782
I could not believe I was going to do that to my sister, let alone anyone else.|12782
I got help after that.|12782
[BK][BK]The next few years were hard.|12782
I struggled as hard as I could to never do that to my family again.|12782
Some days were good.|12782
Lots were bad: many days I could not wake up, Many sleepless nights of self hatred.|12782
[BK][BK]During that time, everyone around me told me they loved me, that they were happy I was still there, and a lot of other caring words.|12782
I filtered them all out.|12782
I could not hear them.|12782
They were not true words.|12782
They did not really mean it.|12782
[BK][BK]I tried a lot of treatments and prescriptions before I finally started to feel better about myself again.|12782

The nurse came by shortly after and I cleaned me up.|12782
I do not remember what I was thinking but I remember being terrified, I just reached out for the nurses hand and he held it.|12782
I guess I either fell asleep or passed out again shortly after.|12782

And now they will never let me end it.|12782
[BK][BK]Woke up in a psych ward, the same room I had been in only a year before in the same scrubs and the same problems.|12782
Only had a week left until I turned 18, and if I was still there when the day came then I would be put in psych care for the foreseeable future.|12782
[BK][BK]I had to decide whether to be that kid who dies in a psych ward (they make it difficult obviously, my options were either head trauma or a stolen pen) or lock all my problems in the vault and lie to every nurse and doctor I saw just to feel the sun on my face again.|12782

Acetaminophen and vodka and a nap in the snow.|12782

This is about a friend of mine who i helped.|12782
I suppose it is loosely relevant but it might help any of you going through this or if you need to help someone.|12782
[BK][BK]Basically around about 10pm i got a call from my friend.|12782
She sounded upset and sad and just wanted someone to talk to.|12782
[BK][BK]We talked for a bit, and i do not remember exactly what sparked my comment, but it apparently helped her out immensely.|12782
She was talking about how she just seemed like a burden on people, and that she couldnt find anything going well in her life.|12782
I told her something along the lines of 'at the moment, yes.|12782
You are sad and you are latching onto people who do not want to hang out with a depressed person.|12782
It is draining.|12782
But i remember when you were happy and had goals and things you wanted to learn and do.|12782
I do not keep hanging out with you because i like how you are now.|12782
I keep trying to help you get get back to where you were before.|12782
Happy and full of life.|12782
I want to help you become your old self.|12782
One who inspired others by being herself.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Basically i wanted to explain to her that in order for people to like you, you need to like yourself."|12782
I remembered when she wasnt moping around and instead was helping others push themselves.|12782
I wanted the old her back, and i knew she could do it.|12782
[BK][BK]I found out about 2 or 3 months later, after she started seeing a therapist, that when she called me she was in the bathtub with two razor blades aside her.|12782
The phone conversation was one of of a few i got from her, but that time seemed different to me.|12782
[BK][BK]She now works for Microsoft and while not completely happy with her job, is working on being happy.|12782
I think she has finally gotten to a stable part in her life, and it is still part of my life where I was happy that she called someone before she did anything.|12782
I guess I will leave with this.|12782
[BK][BK]If you are going to try anything, call someone who cares about you.|12782
If they are close enough, they can help you.|12782
They know you and will help let you live another day.|12782
There is no need to give up.|12782
Someone put there wants you to live again.|12782
[BK][BK]If you think you are getting one of these calls, think back to why you care about that person.|12782
"Think back to when you said  '"" hey, you are someone i want to be around'""."|12782
Give that back.|12782
Be there for them.|12782

My personal take.|12782
Suicide is for the weak.|12782
It is for people who couldnt find a way out and they felt they had no other options.|12782
No other way of ending this sorrow.|12782
There is always another way, and you need to find another way.|12782
You only get one life.|12782

When I woke up from that, I honestly just wanted to die.|12782
All I could think about was how I could end my life.|12782
Probably the darkest day in my life, to be honest.|12782
If anyone out there is suffering the way I am, please message me.|12782
I would be more than happy to talk with you.|12782
Hang in there, there is always hope.|12782
"'I look like an idiot'"""""|12782
Reading all these stories has taught me a lot and reinforced the notion that I really want to help people.|12782
I hope everyone is doing well and are in a better place.|12782
Thank you for sharing your stories and teaching many of us.|12782
[BK][BK]Everyone is important.|12782
Can someone explain to me that with all the information online, why you would use most of the suicide methods in this thread, well known to be ineffective, if you truly wanted to die?|12782
It seems like everyone who survived was really a cry for help?|12782
Or am I wrong.|12782
Lost two friends to suicide the past 4 weeks.|12782
Self inflicted gun shot|12782
"'O my fucking god the hospital bill...'""  was my actual first thought."|12782
I got out of a car on the freeway after taking a bunch of pills.|12782
"The next thing I remember was saying to a receptionist '""Why?"|12782
"Do I LOOK like I am on something?'"""|12782
and then seeing my reflection in the mirror and seeing half my face was black.|12782
I did not know what was going on but that was before being bandaged - I had road rash from my face all the way down to my leg as I had been briefly dragged by the car after being caught on the belt.|12782
[BK][BK]Then they kept me so doped up for about a week that I was too fucked up to finish the job.|12782
"By the time they released me I was thousands of dollars in debt but I have to admit, I had lost the will to kill myself."""|12782
I feel as if my experience is a bit extreme compared to what im reading.|12782
I really want to post the article, but it has personal information in it :(|12782

"And also, '""why am I covered in bloody vomit?'"""|12782
""""|12782
My mom walked in on me trying to hang myself, and I felt so terrible and selfish, seeing her expression when she saw the noose.|12782
I have never felt worse in my life then when my mom was crying on her bed, holding me and my dad.|12782
It was a really rough time.|12782

"'I need my mom right now.'"""|12782
"Called my mom and told her I love her, dropped out of college, moved home, and figured out what I wanted from life since apparently I did not need to leave it yet. """|12782
 I drank some tide with pills and went to bed hoping I would not wake up.|12782
I ended up sleeping through a lot of the pain that people talk about experiencing.|12782
I went through a really bad catatonic period where I could not feel physical contact of any kind even if I saw it.|12782
[BK][BK]The only thoughts that I kept having until after I got out of the hospital were:[BK]1.)|12782
I should have known that they were lying to me, why the fuck would they ever love me?[BK]2.)|12782
I cannot believe I am so smart, but was not smart enough to succeed in the one thing I wanted to.|12782
[BK][BK]I will admit I relapsed about two years later in April of 2015, but have gone almost a full year without suicidal actions of any kind.|12782
I want to say from one person who has dealt with this to another, it might not feel like it but things do get a little better.|12782
You can find solace in friends and hobbies.|12782
Engross yourself in something that makes you happy it does help.|12782
[BK][BK]If you ever need anything and you feel like no one else will listen, I will.|12782
Message me and rant, cry, or yell whatever you need.|12782
Please do not leave this world because you feel like no one cares, because I do.|12782
"'Ow... My head...'""[BK][BK]I tried suffocating myself with a plastic bag when I was younger but my reflexes kicked in and I bit a hole in the bag, letting enough air in to keep me alive."|12782
[BK]I still passed out.|12782
Woke up a bit later with a massive headache and a swollen neck (apparently, choking half-to-death can cause some serious strain on your neck, who knew?).|12782
[BK]Later that day, my parents asked about my neck, messed up voice, and bloodshot eyes.|12782
I actually told them I tried smoking week and hated it.|12782
It was easier than admitting I tried to end it all.|12782
[BK][BK]Never told them the truth.|12782

at my lowest point I tried to shoot my self and it just went click and a felt this cold chill run down my spine and I realized quickly it did not work.|12782
"Then I remembered a week prior I had a buddy over and we had gotten into the conversation of handguns, so I grabbed mine to show him and naturally I unloaded it, then we ended up haveing to leave quickly to be somewhere and I put it back up without chambering a round."""|12782
The next morning, after taking all the pills I could find (I have a lot around, due to Crohn's disease.|12782
No opiate painkillers at the time though) [BK][BK]Welp, I tried my hardest.|12782
I am sober now, and despite wanting it, I cannot really bring myself to do much more.|12782
I should probably go to the hospital since if I am not dead yet, then all I will accomplish is maiming myself.|12782
[BK][BK]Spent three days in there.|12782
Looks like my life was saving by one of the packs of pills I chowed down on - Losec, blocked digestion of everything.|12782
It was fucking weird.|12782
I passed out and next thing I knew, I was in hell, that shit was fucking terrifying.|12782
"Then when I came out of it on the hospital bed, I just remembered thinking, 'well what now?'"""""|12782
I wonder how long carbon monoxide actually takes to kill.|12782
[BK][BK]I sat in the garage for... An hour?|12782
Left because I was worried my parents would wake up|12782
I did not pass out.|12782
I swallowed bleach and the person with me handed me the phone and said call an ambulance, which I did.|12782
I then lied and said it was an accident.|12782
My parents are going to be so mad at me.|12782
That it was good I woke up.|12782
Someone has to feed my cat.|12782
It was not a full on attempt, but I wanted to die.|12782
"My then boyfriend called the cops on me and the most coherent memories I have of that night are thinking 'this is not happening'"", asking a nurse if the camera in my ER/A&E room was on, and telling my mom not to cry because I was gonna cry."|12782
[BK][BK]Also I asked the medic why there was a stuffed bear in the ambulance.|12782
"Cause that is what you talk about to an EMT when you are being taken to the hospital for being suicidal."""|12782
That if a single soul in my high school found out they would accuse me of being an attention seeking selfish moron, because a teachers wife had committed suicide less than three months earlier.|12782
[BK][BK]They did, and they did.|12782
Woke up in a hospital alone, in the dark, confused, and hysterical.|12782
The only nurse to check on me laughed as he asked, 'you are not trying to hurt yourself, are you?'|12782
when he walked in as I was digging through a drawer.|12782
I was.|12782
I found those weird popsicle sticks and broke them in half and tried to sharpen them and cut my wrists with that.|12782
It did not work.|12782
[BK][BK]I spent the next (?)|12782
hours delusional in a hospital bed, sobbing.|12782
When my parents finally came back I was so, so happy to see them.|12782
It took me weeks to actually acknowledge the severity of what I did.|12782
I still have a big gap in my memory.|12782
The only reason I survived was because I had posted some nonsensical 'goodbye' on my blog and my best friend at the time called the police from another country.|12782
[BK][BK]Though I still struggle severely with mental illness, I do not want to die.|12782
I am so thankful for life.|12782
It was kind of a mixture of relief and panic.|12782
At one point I was in and out of consciousness a lot and as soon as I was kind of awake I was desperately wanting somebody to help me, probably the body's self preserving defence.|12782
I fully woke up in the back of an ambulance and holy shit I was distraught that I had not died and ended up fighting the paramedics so they would not treat me but stopped when I vomited in the guy's eye because I felt super guilty.|12782
I felt incredibly uncomfortable, with my parents freaking out and everyone checking me on the hospital bed.|12782
Like I had committed an terrible faux pas, and everyone was judging me for it.|12782
Awkwardness was definitely the most predominant emotion in that situation.|12782
I have had multiple attempts.|12782
I cannot remember any of my initial thoughts just a overwhelming feeling of guilt.|12782
Mum would always find me and I cannot forgive myself for that.|12782
But she always was there for me.|12782
[BK]Now, even though I still struggle with depression and sometimes the same thoughts, I do not want to die.|12782
It's actually made me fear death, and now I worry that because I wanted to die for so long that I have 'tempted fate' somehow.|12782
[BK]The daft thing is I do not even believe in fate!|12782
[BK]I want to live more than ever, and see the world and experience life.|12782
'Dad?|12782
Mom?|12782

This thread has really given me some perspective, my case of depression really is not that bad, and I definitely do not want it to get worse judging by all these responses.|12782

I had temporarily lost my hearing because last second I decided to off-aim a .38 revolver.|12782

It was 6PM when I woke up, just in time for my Mom to tell me I need to prep because it is a Sunday and we had to go to church.|12782
I was confused when I woke up and just nodded, but once it all sank in, I started cursing the world because, *it did not fucking work*.|12782
I checked my phone to find confused messages from my best friend aka one of the people I said good bye to.|12782
She called repeatedly but I did not answer.|12782
All I can think about at Church was how stupid what I did was and how I am a failure-- I cannot even kill myself properly.|12782

Only vague things I remember was having my stomach pump and having walked into the emergency room.|12782

I had not slept in 48 hours and was really out of it so no clue what I put up.|12782
The hospital check in did not know what was going on so I was just sitting in waiting room waiting my turn till my mom apparently came in and told them what happened.|12782
I was immediately rushed to the back where they pumped my stomach.|12782

[BK][BK]Ive kind of been stuck between those two feelings for the past 5 or so years.|12782
Sometimes wish I would have succeeded, yet I do not want to make the people close to me sad.|12782

I thought long and hard about whether I wanted to answer this, but I have massive scars on my wrists that tell (a) the story itself, or in some cases simply (b) the one that people are going to infer and predicate judgments on.|12782
I am not ashamed of going to battle and having come out scathed anymore, though, so here's hoping this brings something of value to someone else caught in the trenches.|12782
[BK][BK]I sliced my wrist in two lines down to the last dermal layer; I drank myself numb and capped the sensation with painkillers.|12782
I went punch-drunk on oxygen loss as I bled out and stumbled back to bed, hysterically crying out what I figured would be my last few hours to reflect on the desperate and scared loser I would degenerated into over the last few years.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up about 12 hours later, still swimming in blood and dizzy.|12782
As many chances as I have had to say and think the same words, they have still never rode in on the same kind of panic that they did that afternoon.|12782
[BK][BK]*Oh, no.|12782
*[BK][BK]I had no idea what to do.|12782
I did not expect this.|12782
I panicked as I considered the next step; I was too weak, too exhausted, and just too scared to try and finish the job.|12782
I was *terrified* to go out into the world, though, because my injuries were impossible to hide; I would either bleed through my clothes or have to wear an incredibly obvious and makeshift splint.|12782
I tried to just shake it off and press on as I had in recent days; I was not going outside much anyway.|12782
I could lay low for a while and put off deciding anything, I told myself.|12782
[BK][BK]I showered, guarding my gaping-open wrist from the water.|12782
I sent an email politely excusing myself from work that day due to a personal emergency.|12782
I tried to spend the day hiding at home and processing out all the frightened and confused feelings.|12782
It did not work out.|12782
It culminated in the police coming to check on me when my absence drew concern and me getting taken off to the hospital.|12782
[BK][BK]That was not the last time I would ever sink that low, but it is still the last time I would ever attempt to end my life.|12782
This life is at times very dark, and *very* scary, but if you are reading this and you feel that same sense of despair and panic, for God's sake, do not do it.|12782
If nothing else carries you through the next few days, just believe, because it is true, that you will end your life suffering harder than you ever have if that is how you choose to go.|12782
If you fail, then that is what you you will get to carry around for ages after.|12782
There may be no immediate fix to the things that bind you, but it will cost you so much less to have the courage to live through these next few days than it will to abandon the fight.|12782
Even if you have to remind yourself of that every few days, you are doing a wonderful thing for yourself and everyone who loves you.|12782
Well it is not exactly a survivor story but I did find out that I ruined my wife's plans to kill herself by randomly dropping a lovey card and treats on her.|12782

I am not one of those impulsive suicide attempters, I planned waaay in advance, and also did a lot of prep.|12782
Not that that is any better, just different.|12782
[BK][BK]I acquired lots of Xanax, Oxycodone, GHB and also bought some vodka and ciders.|12782
The ciders were mainly just to add more alcohol into my system because I cannot really stand spirits.|12782
[BK][BK]My intention was to overload my system on CNS depressants (all of which the above are), so that I could just stop breathing.|12782
I did not even care if I aspirated vomit, I just wanted to leave.|12782
So I took 14mg Xanax, a quarter litre of vodka, three ciders, 3-5ml GHB and snorted 40mg Oxycodone to be exact.|12782
Obviously, do not ever do this, it is awful.|12782
[BK][BK]Well, I felt high for about a minute but then I was wretching over the sink.|12782
I do not think I have ever vomited in my life, it is weird, but when I drink too much or whatever, I usually just get extremely nauseous but hold it in.|12782
[BK][BK]Then immediately after it was just like complete darkness.|12782
I was completely unconscious, and it was just...nothing.|12782
I am 100% certain if I had succeeded, that would be what death is.|12782
Just nothing.|12782
I mean, who knows if you are reborn or if there really is an afterlife or something but that was my experience.|12782
[BK][BK]I time travelled a couple of hours into the future, so it seemed like only a couple seconds had passed when I awoke in a hospital bed with an IV and my parents plus lots of medical staff stood around.|12782
Apparently, I had told my flatmates that I was going for a walk and managed to get pretty far away before collapsing.|12782
I had no memory or awareness of that, and that is the scariest part to me; drugs can really mess you up, especially the ones I mentioned.|12782
Someone found me just in time; much later and my breathing could have completely stopped, and worst case scenario I would have been brain damaged.|12782
Yes, that would be worse than death imo.|12782
[BK][BK]So I was lucky, well, depending on your perspective.|12782
To be brutally honest, when I woke up my only regret was that it did not work.|12782
I spent the night in the hospital, they told me to speak to a mental health team and let me go.|12782
I am not sure if they thought my overdose was accidental or not, so they might not have considered me a suicide risk.|12782
[BK][BK]I spent the next couple of weeks recovering, sleeping days away, and I am pretty sure I have done some kind of damage to myself.|12782
Sometimes I feel drunk, I slur my words, my concentration has deteriorated, my thinking has blurred, but I only have myself to blame.|12782
[BK][BK]Reflecting on it now, I kind of think that I was just desperate and wanting to relieve the intense suffering I was going through.|12782
But there is a lot life has to offer.|12782
I want to see the world, I have so many experiences awaiting and I would have squandered that.|12782
[BK][BK] I am only 21, so regardless of your past or your situation, any death at that age is a complete waste.|12782
The only constant in life is change.|12782
I am sure I will have even higher highs and even lower lows, but I can also be sure that I will not be doomed to feeling miserable constantly.|12782
The average life span is only around 70-80 years old anyway, which is just a tiny blip in time.|12782
Cutting it short is like flipping an hourglass when there are only a few grains of sand left to fall...if that analogy makes sense!|12782
[BK][BK]If you are feeling suicidal yourself, my advice is to really dig deep into those feelings.|12782
Sounds counter intuitive, but by letting yourself experience those emotions and seeing what is causing them through meditation and such really helped me.|12782
You could come to realise that it is purely a chemical imbalance, which is easily treatable.|12782
Or that it is purely situational, and like I said, that will change in time.|12782

The thought of whoever would have to find me.|12782
My depression should not become someone else's.|12782
I was worried about what people would think of me|12782
Pure shock and terror once i realized the gun had jammed on me.|12782
Then I got so pissed at shit fucking up on me that I went and kicked a hole in the wall in our bathroom where I was at the time.|12782
Got in alot of trouble for that hole, mostly because I refused to tell my parents why I had gotten so mad to kick the wall in the first place.|12782
They still dont know why...|12782
Well, this is my story.|12782
(TL;DR I am a homeless youth with life threatening depression, you can figure out the rest)[BK][BK][BK]I grew up in a well-off family (not like rich or anything, be we had enough) living on a 5 acre (~20200m squared) farm with my mum, dad, younger brother and sister.|12782
At the age of 8, my parents split up, and mum took us kids.|12782
We moved to the Gold Coast, Australia, where to this day, I still live.|12782
Moving to a new primary school was tough, since I was the quiet type.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]All through school, I was bullied for not having friends, and I could not make friends because everyone was an asshole.|12782
By this point, both my original parents had found new partners, and I rarely saw my dad.|12782
I have been dealing with depression since about my parents break up, but have never told either about it, because they were not the type to care, so I left it to myself.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]I told myself that I would try to make friends during high school, and I did.|12782
But my life took a huge turn for the worst after I left school.|12782
During my entire life living with my mum, there had been lies flung between her and my dad.|12782
Because of that, I had learnt to never trust anyone.|12782
The trust issues go further, but I might leave that for another time.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]The first weekday (so a Monday) after I had finished Grade 12, I had a very serious ankle injury, where I had torn almost everything in my right ankle.|12782
I was in bed for a good few weeks.|12782
While I was still recovering, my mum had told me that she does not want me living there anymore, and that I had to go live with my dad.|12782
So I moved to live with my dad, just months before my 18th birthday.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]For the next couple of months, I was living at my nan''s place (he lived with his mother due to financial troubles) where I had gotten a job.|12782
But a couple of months into the job, they had found a better staff member, so I was laid off.|12782
For about a month or two, I had been looking for more work, but nothing was suitable for me.|12782
"[BK][BK][BK]Then, one morning, I woke up to my dad telling me; 'We cannot have you living here anymore, you need to leave.'"""|12782
I was given a day to pack my stuff and leave.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]It had not hit me at that point, but I had ended up homeless, with no roof over my head, no food to keep me alive, and not even a single cent to my name.|12782
As I prepared m6self for the first night sleeping alone in my car (thank FUCKING god I had a car and a license) I got a call from my mum, she had heard about what had happened, and told me to come back around to her place until I found a place.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]So I spent a day or so looking for places, until I came across a homeless youth service based on the Gold Coast; the [GCPHY](http://www.homelessyouth.com.au) (Gold Coast Project for Homeless Youth).|12782
I called them and moved into the house that day.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]Fast forward a few months, I had moved out of the Crisis Shelter (Lawson House) and moved into a Medium Term Shelter (Jessica Dunne Lodge), I had started to yet my life back on track, and I met some really great people within the system.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]There have been days/nights where I feel good, even happy, but there have been times where I have wanted to end my life.|12782
One of those nights, I felt so bad, I almost drank a bottle of Bleach.|12782
Before I did though, I had told one of the workers, and I was sent to Hospital so I would not try to harm myself any further.|12782
"[BK][BK][BK]For what I thought after being sent to Hospital, my first conscious thought was; '""Maybe it was a better idea to end myself."|12782
"'""[BK][BK][BK]It has been about 2-3 months since that had happened."|12782
I still live in that shelter to this very moment, and I still get thoughts of wanting to end my life.|12782
Yes I have had good things happen since then, aswell as bad.|12782
But the main thing is now; I am still here, and I would not be here telling you my story if I had gone through with any of my thoughts.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]Any that want to say this is not true, go right ahead.|12782
This is my true story, what I have had to go through to get to where I am today, is 100% true.|12782
"[BK]"""|12782
I have been suicidal since I was 11.|12782
My best friend and I were victims of physical, emotional and verbal bullying and it ended up with both of us self harming and I took about 15 Panadol pills (the only medicine we had left from all the times I faked sick to avoid school).|12782
It did not do much except knock me out  (my first thought after I woke up was 'why am I still here') and leave me dizzy for the next 48 hours.|12782
My self harm continued and I tried drowning myself multiple times after because I did not want to do the pills again and I did not have a convenient place to hang myself or jump off of.|12782
I am 16 now and I am 6 months clean after I realised how useless self harm is, and also as someone who is into Marilyn Manson and avenged sevenfold and stuff like that I got called Emo a lot and people would mimick cutting and stuff and it motivated me to stop.|12782
[BK][BK]I am still suicidal and I still hate who I am but no one knows.|12782
"'Huh...'"" It was really weird, too."|12782
Most of the time, you do not think in words, exactly... it is more like concepts, at least that is how I think.|12782
"In that exact moment, though, I visualized the text, like it was writing on the page of a book, '""...'"" and all."|12782
"[BK][BK]What came next was more of an '""oh well'"" type feeling that worked like my normal thought process."|12782
"There was no extreme emotional reaction right away, just a dull sense of '""guess I am still here.'"""|12782
""""|12782
I tied my arms and legs together with waits and kinda belly-flopped/rolled into the pool.|12782
Apparently my dog starting barking something fierce when she saw me go in, so my neighbour jumped the wall to check it out and saw me.|12782
He jumped in and pulled me out.|12782
But I would already drowned at this point.|12782
I do not know how long I was dead.|12782
Anywhere between 2-7 minutes.|12782
He revived me and my first thought was 'Fuck, I fucked up.|12782

When I was 13 I tried to overdose.|12782
I took a whole bottle of aspirin, probably around 40-60 pills.|12782
As soon as I finished swallowing the last pill, I was immediately filled with regret.|12782
I realized what I was giving up.|12782
I induced vomiting almost immediately after.|12782
Not much has improved since then.|12782
Everyday I regret stopping myself a little more.|12782
I will not bother attempting again though, do not care enough anymore.|12782
I am glad to hear so many 'positive' stories here.|12782
Though I think it is important to remember that there is bias in what we are hearing.|12782
There will be those who did not succeed who immediately attempted suicide again who obviously cannot tell the story of the gap between attempts here.|12782
What's more worrying is there might be those who have the horrible realisation they want to live, when it is too late.|12782
[BK][BK]I am so glad everyone of you who posted here, are still here.|12782
Annoyance, which was followed by the realization that I had to change so that I would never be in that position again.|12782
That attempt was exactly one year ago, and I have change my life tremendously.|12782

"'Guess I am not dyin today'"" [BK][BK]Then i took a chug from a bottle of whiskey, lit a cigarette in the kitchen."|12782
Finished the cigarette then drove myself to the hospital to get the gaping wound i created checked out.|12782

[BK][BK]Parked the car in front of the hospital then checked myself in to triage.|12782
"They still gave me a parking ticket. """|12782

I could not even do this right.|12782

[BK]That day and the ones that followed like others have mentioned was weird.|12782
It was such a big week in my life but only to me.|12782
Everything looked, smelt & felt different to me.|12782
People went about things without any clue.|12782
It was as fascinating as just plain sad.|12782

Luckily, I never tried again.|12782

[BK][BK]Stunned by disbelief for a while.|12782
Followed by covering my tracks so my parents would not find out.|12782
[BK][BK]Took a huge amount of opiates, end of life medication, oramorph etc.|12782
along with a bottle of whisky.|12782
Turns out taking that much caused my body to reject it.|12782

[BK][BK]Edit: I should add, that was about 20 years ago.|12782

Things felt warm and confusing and I could not breathe.|12782
"I frantically tried to loosen the rope and my first formed thought was '""Holy fuck, what did I just almost do?'"""|12782
Then I started crying hysterically, called my mom (I was 27 at the time).|12782
I never felt more alive those weeks after that .|12782

Put a gun to my head in Iraq, and a friend stopped me.|12782
All I was thinking about was how bad I was hurting.|12782
Like heartburn x10 with nausea and a constant migraine.|12782
Heartbreak was the most torturous experience of my life, and I just wanted it to end.|12782
'Fuck.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I guess it could be interpreted as fuck this, fuck im still here, fuck my life."|12782
I was just angry and tired and did not want to go on.|12782
It all happened in a row, first I took some pills, woke up groggy and ''drunk'', tried to get myself into a car accident, and got the police called over, then i jumped off a roof to try to seal the deal, that did not work either.|12782
I ended up with a fractured spine and still really wanted to just die.|12782
Afterwards I felt really shitty that even after everything, I could not even kill myself -- was I so big of a loser that I cannot make this one thing right after decades of contemplating it?|12782
The one thing good that came out of this is that my parents became more understanding of my condition and I cut out some toxic people in my life (I still debate if that was a good thing).|12782
Now I am living with a disability and still contemplating jumping off the roof again.|12782
"I just do not want to live life."""|12782

"'I still want to die, quit trying to stop this'"""""|12782
My first thought?|12782
It was that I was such a failure that I could not even do that action right, and I felt really ashamed.|12782
I understand now that it was because I had serious major depression that I felt and thought that way.|12782
If you do feel that way, please find help.|12782
There are things that are worth living for.|12782

I have never forgotten how grateful I was to be saved, I realised how selfish it was to leave my family to grieve, how self-indulgent it was to leave it all behind and most importantly how senseless it was to throw away my only chance at living so soon.|12782
Pain, suffering, fears and doubts are only ephemeral, so why not wait them out I realised, maybe it will turn around, maybe things do get better.|12782

The hospital I was in was designed for long stays and people who were not at immediate risk of suicide (people who became acutely suicidal  while admitted were transferred to a locked SCU ward for a few days, before returning to the clinic).|12782
As a result of this, the rules about what you could have in your room were not as strict as on a typical locked ward, so nobody had taken my dressing gown sash away from me.|12782
I went into my bathroom and rigged up a setup for ligature strangulation - which I will not describe in detail - and strangled myself.|12782
I remember losing consciousness very quickly, and the last thing I remember feeling was a sense of warmth and safety and peace that I had not felt in years.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not know how much time passed (felt like forever, was probably not too long or the nurse would have come in for checks), but I just remember suddenly hearing...bees.|12782
Like, a loud intense buzzing, like there was a hive in the room.|12782
I wondered why there were bees, and then I remember clawing at myself and I must have been pulling the ligature off, because next thing I knew I was coughing my guts out on the floor.|12782
When I got a bit of sense back and realised that there were no bees, I was panicking - I had a big bruise on my neck and was terrified that if the nurse saw it they would send me off to the SCU place and that felt like a fate worse than death at the time.|12782
I also remember crying because I remembered the warm and safe feeling and wanted to go back to it and not be alive and trapped.|12782
I eventually covered my neck with my hair and took my dressing gown sash down to the nurse''s station and asked them to hold onto it for me, and then asked for my prn meds because I felt anxious.|12782
Idk what they thought, but I did not get sent to the SCU, so.|12782
[BK][BK]Equal to that attempt was the time I tried to drown myself, but that was a lot less deliberate.|12782
It was about five months after the attempt I described above, and this time I was dissociated out of my brain, and in said dissociated state I absconded from the hospital and wandered away, apparently eventually jumping in the nearby river in some weird suicide attempt (I say weird because I would definitely plan a self-drowning a lot more carefully than jumping in a river on impulse while dissociated).|12782
"I have very little memory of any of this and really only '""woke up'"" from the dissociation when I hit the (cold) water, which was a shock - I guess my first thought was really '""what the fuck?'""."|12782
After swallowing and gagging on some filthy river water, I tried my best to hold on to rocks and things  and swim to the bank to get out, but the current was strong and by the time I got to the river bank I was exhausted.|12782
The river bank was incredibly steep - it was like...a four foot high stone wall, kind of?|12782
the river is in a city area - and even though I tried to haul myself up onto the pavement a few times, I could not do it.|12782
"I was clinging to this pipe thing and crying, and I remember looking up at the river bank and thinking '""I could just let go."|12782
If I let the current take me I would probably drown.|12782
"I should just give up on all this and let go.'"""|12782
I remember thinking about that warm/safe feeling from my previous attempt and desperately wanting to go back to that because I was so tired.|12782
I decided to try a few more times and then give up - and on the second to last try I managed to throw my leg up over the top of the bank and like...roll up onto the pavement.|12782
And when I realised that I had fucked up/chickened out from killing myself *again*, I remember just....panicking and not knowing what to do.|12782
I ended up calling my (long-term, trusted) outpatient therapist, who - bless him - drove out in the middle of the night and somehow found me based on my extremely fuzzy and incoherent description of where I was (I did not remember how I would gotten there), and he calmed me down and convinced me to go back to the hospital.|12782
"[BK][BK]There were also a handful of overdoses when I was younger, because I did not really know what I was doing, and my first thought on waking up from most of those was '""Goddamnit'"", or something similar - I just basically felt pissed off and really sick."|12782
Once I attempted to give myself sleeping pills and go down to the river to drown myself (this was years before the river incident above), but I passed out on the street on my way there and ended up staggering home when I woke up several hours later.|12782
I was pissed off and fucked up about that one too, but I do remember thinking some darkly amused thoughts about how absurdly incompetent the attempt had been.|12782
[BK][BK]Wow, that comment got long.|12782
Idk if this is what you wanted OP, but thank you for making this post.|12782
I do not really talk about my suicide attempts at length with anyone - not even my therapist.|12782
I had a friend who I used to talk about this stuff with, but we kind of mutually uncoupled a while ago, and nowdays...I guess I pretend none of it ever happened, for the sake of the people who care about me.|12782
But it did happen, and these were huge horrible life events, and it feels kind of cleansing to really just...get it out of my head and tell someone.|12782
"[BK][BK]"""|12782
Shit should have used a stronger rope|12782

"I failed.'"""|12782
This was in September of 2015-- I would gone into an extreme manic state (based on some really awful things going on in my personal life), downed a bottle of pills, and slashed my wrists repeatedly (scars which I will always bare as labels forcing me to wear long sleeve shirts for the rest of my days) and did not want to wake up ever again.|12782
I do not know how, but my roommate knew something  was wrong (he would seen me the night before and I was a complete mess-- drunk, crying, not making sense) and kicked open my (locked) door, saw all the blood, and immediately took me to the hospital.|12782
I got thirty seven stitches across my wrists and greatly damaged my kidneys from the extreme amount of pills I had taken.|12782
I was 51/50''d and spent a week in a mental hospital.|12782
"Which only made things worse as it was one of the most wretched and downright scary places I would ever visited-- condescending and unhelpful staff, being forced to share rooms with dangerous patients (my '""roommate'"" for lack of a better term, threatened to kill me repeatedly and when I reported it to the staff they just said, '""well, we will check in on you every now and then'""), hell-- I did not even see a counselor or an internist for three days (I was supposed to see one within the first twenty four hours)."|12782
I was eventually discharged and diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.|12782
I have since become medicated and go to therapy once a week.|12782
In all honesty?|12782
I am still most DEFINITELY suicidal, but I will never act on it again for fear of going back to a place as hellish as the mental ward where I was sent.|12782
I try to focus on the good things, I truly do-- I have a place to live, a good family, a car, a job, good friends-- but every day is still a struggle.|12782
I will never forget the look on my parent''s faces when they saw me in the hospital, I will never forget hearing my brother cry on the phone (it was the only time I have ever in my life heard him cry) when he called me in the hospital.|12782
I will carry guilt for my selfish act for the rest of my days, but I know that being free and able to live day-to-day is much better than the alternative of being confined to an institution.|12782
I am trying-- I really am-- but it is still so goddamn difficult to silence these dangerous thoughts in my head.|12782
I hope and pray that some day they will go away, but in the mean time I just do the best I can and try to silence them.|12782
I need to realize that I am lucky to be alive and deserving of a good life.|12782
It''s up to me to earn a good life-- and despite all the bullshit and pain and fear, it is still something I *have* to go for, because letting the darkness consume me will never help.|12782
Again, every day is a struggle, but nothing worth having is easy to get.|12782

My depression is entirely brain chemistry, I have a loving family, great friends and nothing truly traumatic, but it is almost worse because of it.|12782
Most people who survive suicide feel better, they realise that all their problems are fixable and life can move in.|12782
Mine is not.|12782
There is a part of my brain, now and forever, telling me that I need to die.|12782
It tells me that life is not worth living and even if it was, I do not deserve to live it.|12782

[BK][BK]I went to a skyscraper here in miami and almost jumped off a very high balcony.|12782
I just acted like I lived there, it was surprisingly easy, and quite beautiful.[BK][BK]Why?|12782
I trusted a company called Uber.|12782
[BK][BK]Like many others, I was an early adopter, bought a very nice car, provided excellent service, and made a  moderate living, i.e.|12782
35k after cost.|12782
[BK][BK]Then, Uber started the now infamous rate cuts.|12782
They even had the balls to say wed make more money.|12782
Quickly, the rates dropped 50% practically overnight, and the profit portion has dropped literally 80%.|12782
[BK][BK]After cost, I make $30 per day, driving for 10 hours on average.|12782
[BK][BK]I have to drive more, to keep a roof over my head, which prevents me from  applying to more jobs.|12782
[BK][BK]It''s a vicious cycle that is hard to escape from.|12782
One month, my tires had to be replaced, all 4 of them.|12782
[BK][BK]I replaced the tires at the expense of rent.|12782
I then started sleeping in my car.|12782
[BK][BK]Then, further rate cuts.|12782
More hours needed to survive.|12782
[BK][BK]Now, spring break is over.|12782
I lasted two weeks before I tried and failed to kill myself.|12782
[BK][BK]Some days, I literally make $60 before all costs, driving 10 hours.|12782

Almost like that feeling after you have been hysterically crying for hours, but there is no tears anymore and your throat and eyes are really dry and all you want to do is sleep.|12782

The whole experience was horrifying, from being told that I would been sedated and on a ventilator for a week, to listening to people die around me in intensive care, to the hallucinations I had as side effects of my attempted overdose, and having to spend a few days getting my legs to walk again.|12782
I would not wish it on anyone, and it cemented my resolve that I would never put myself in a position to suffer like that again.|12782
Having survived that means I now know I can take on anything life has for me.|12782
You know that feeling when you have dropped your phone in water or something, or your pet's lying super still and does not appear to be breathing, or you do not remember if you sent that totally inappropriate email to your colleague or your boss?|12782
Waking up again 8 hours after taking over a hundred pills was like that big sigh when you realise no, your phone's fine; your pet looks at you; the email went to your colleague.|12782
I do not know what happened between falling asleep and waking up; I do not even know how I woke up and called an ambulance, as by rights I should have been dead; but the feeling was a total rush of [BK]'Someone up there likes me.|12782
Open your eyes, keep breathing, and do not ever fuck up like that again'.|12782
It hurts|12782
"'Aww man, I am gonna have to do this all over again'"" """|12782

'Holy shit my head is killing me.|12782

What was I thinking?|12782
Wtf is wrong with me mom would kill herself!!!|12782
Alright stop feeling bad for yourself and fight back.... Those honest to God were my thoughts, I was 15 hated my siblings, they took the world out on me.|12782
The world will make you tougher or let you pass.|12782

[BK]Young people be strong, it get better.|12782
Kind of.|12782
I do not think those berries were actually poisonous.|12782
Took a fuck ton of pills like usual.|12782
Ended up not being able to keep them down.|12782
Was pissed.|12782
Woke up in my own vomit (mix of pills and alcohol several times) was pissed then too.|12782
Mostly because I still had to go to school.|12782
I felt like an idiot because I did not do it properly.|12782
I was 17 at the time & seeing my full grown oldest brother who was in his 30s cry was heart wrenching.|12782
It made me realise how childish my problems.|12782
Don't get me wrong bad things made me do it but seeing my family hurting was way worse.|12782
This was the worst year for my family because I ended up back in after nearly dying due to childbirth 8 months later.|12782
I am so glad I survived.|12782

"I still wake up thinking '""Fuuuck'"" everyday and cry all the time (4 years later) [BK][BK]"""|12782
I have never attempted suicide because I cannot bring myself to do it.|12782
I always think of ways that I can go but I can never bring myself to act on them.|12782
I would not mind if I died right this second.|12782
[BK][BK]So I guess in their own way they are failed suicide attempts.|12782
I am upset whenever I cannot go through with it and I keep wishing that I could.|12782
Every time I fail I think how much better it would be if I succeeded.|12782
I just want it all to end.|12782
When I woke up I was in a psych ward.|12782
Neither of my parents came to see me because my mom had made me live with my grandparents a state over.|12782
Basically it felt like no one cared and I went on to swallow pills again a year after.|12782
I made a mistake though because depression meds will not kill you but they can make you brain dead.|12782
Anyway I met my future husband after the second time and it finally gave me something to live for.|12782
I am doing much better now.|12782
'Guess I have to try again.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]And I have."|12782
I still have not succeeded, and I am not sure when my next attempt will be.|12782
But I think I will always try to kill myself for as long as I live.|12782
I genuinely hate living.|12782
And there is nothing anyone can do about it.|12782
I will always hate being alive in this shitty world full of grinning fakes.|12782
"So I will keep trying, over and over, until that one time when my final thought will be something along the lines of, '""I can finally leave Hell.'"""""|12782
Fuck, no.|12782

"'I seem to fail at every aspect of my life..'"""""|12782

"Wasn''t able to sit up without almost passing out for about 14 hours, parents thought I was sick."""|12782
Frankly, I think about it killing myself almost everyday and have for at least 3 years.|12782
I am in my 40s and married, have a great job that I hate, and am tired of dealing with all the shit life throws at me.|12782
The details do not matter but I am ready to be done with this life.|12782
I have the means to do it just not the strength and that just depresses me more.|12782

"'Fuck, they are going to send me away to some place for crazy people.'"""""|12782
I never passed out, but as I was dying I realized that I did not want to die alone.|12782
It was kind of a terrifying feeling, one second I am ready to die, Next second, I am freaking out because I realized that I do not after all and I did not know if it was too late.|12782
It was hard to get through that and realize that my life was not as bad as I thought it was, even though it was pretty shitty at the time.|12782
Dying alone is probably my worst fear now.|12782
[BK][BK]I never tried to commit suicide after that.|12782
It was a terrible experience and extremely painful.|12782
I am alive!|12782
!|12782
First thought woah....I am still here.|12782
Second thought, fuck I do not wanna face the day....again...I just went back to normal and decided to not try it again, though I cannot say the thought has not crossed my mind since then, I do not think I would pursue it again.|12782

[BK][BK]Fifteen year old me was thankfully a bit stupid and I tried to drink metholated spirits to kill myself - it had the skull and crossbones on the bottle!|12782

"Many years of therapy and a BADLY needed diagnosis of autism later, I am very very pleased I was kinda dumb."""|12782
I took a whole bottle of Advil and went to sleep with a huge smile, thinking it was finally over.|12782
[BK][BK]Woke up instead confused and slightly disoriented a few hours later, and started doing jumping jacks in the mad hopes it will make the medicine finally work and kill me, I was getting impatient.|12782
[BK][BK]Instead I threw up a bit of blue/green dye and had my father screaming at my face (in anger for a stupid reason, he never found out about the pills) while I kicked myself for not mixing more medicine together.|12782
[BK][BK]I am doing better now, but back then I can still clearly remember the disappointment of waking up alive and the absolute fury that even drugs did not seem able to do me in.|12782

"I still have severe depression, but it made me realize, how can I make it better if I am not there? """|12782
It's just occurred to me that these comments literally suffer from Survivorship bias.|12782

I remember going to the hospital and just begging my mom to get the nurses to just[BK]Let me die.|12782

"My first thought was 'why can I still hear anything, Im supposed to be gone'"" and then all hell broke loose when my mom found me on the floor"""|12782
During an extremely low place in my early 20's, I cut my wrist.|12782
I bled a lot.|12782
So much, that I was unconscious when my father found me.|12782
I vaguely remember him wrapping it and taking me to the hospital.|12782
I remember feeling mostly shame.|12782
Not only was I a failure to my father, but also to myself.|12782
Such loss and grief pushed me to that point.|12782
So much, that I felt as though ending it all was a viable solution.|12782
"'We''ll that sucks'""."|12782
My closest to successful suicide attempt was hanging and I woke up on the floor.|12782
I am fine now, but when I woke up on the floor, I was so disappointed.|12782
It took all that I had to get myself to try everytime and after each failed attempt I was discouraged.|12782
"I got help and I am glad that I failed."""|12782

(Catholic upbringing. )|12782
There was a woman taking notes, and someone had gotten my family and they were around me.|12782
My father expressed his disappointment and my mother kept asking questions I had no answers for.|12782
I believed they were not real, just visions to torment me.|12782
Honestly, the way my family treated me was a big part of why I did what I did.|12782
This idea that I was in hell or purgatory crossed my mind a few times the next day as well.|12782
I did not realize I was not dead until after I was settled in and friends started coming to see me and giving me support and encouragement.|12782
This is such an inspiring thread, though it feels weird to say that.|12782
When I suffered from depression I never attempted suicide but the thoughts were there, and sometimes fleetingly still are, which is scary enough for me.|12782
But the fact that so many of you attempted it and somehow found the strength in your survival to keep going is incredible.|12782
I might be just a stranger on the internet but I am glad you are all still here.|12782
Well fuck.|12782
I had a huge bruise around my neck.|12782
I called it the kiss of death, much like a hickey, but one from the Reaper himself.|12782
I had to wear hoodies for the rest of the summer to cover it up.|12782
It also reconfirmed my thought that the rope I had was too weak.|12782
Only two or three people actually know what happened with why I was wearing hoodies in summer.|12782
I do not really know.|12782
I do not like to think about it too much.|12782

[BK][BK]Eventually it got bad enough that I decided it was not worth the effort anymore.|12782
I swallowed the remainder of a bottle of extra strength Tylenol.|12782
I do not remember exactly how much, it was over a decade ago, but my 13 year old brain figured it would be enough.|12782
After taking the pills I felt this ridiculous sense of freedom and relief.|12782

After puking my guts out, I crawled back into bed.|12782
No one was home at the time, and to my knowledge no one in my family has ever found out.|12782
The closest I ever came to telling anyone was my best friend in the following days at school.|12782
But I did not want to be called crazy (stigma is the word, but my 13 year old self did not have as developed a vocabulary) or put in a mental ward so I never told anyone.|12782
I also did not want to have to explain to the nurse, the principal, my parents etc.|12782
about the awful things (or lack of things sometimes) that I felt.|12782
So I said nothing and continued moving through my life.|12782
School, homework, sleep.|12782
I was very mechanical for many years.|12782
I never attempted again but I certainly thought about it, sometimes daily.|12782
When I was younger, I was dissuaded by the idea that I would just fail again, but as I aged I needed soemthing more to hold on to.|12782
At this point I did not want to die, but a part of me was actively self-destructive.|12782
[BK][BK]Late in high school I hit a turning point.|12782
I do not remember exactly what happened but it involved something to do with studying existentialism.|12782
A good friend of mine had said something to about living life to its fullest, to which I internally scoffed.|12782
But then, I started thinking, although my life was worthless to me, perhaps it could be worth something to someone else.|12782
So I started volunteering, I started helping people whenever I could.|12782
Even if my life was empty, I might as well make other people''s lives better right?|12782
Because I had already failed once to die, so while I was still stuck here, I might as well be useful.|12782
[BK][BK]My volunteering led me to work with teenagers, some dealing with the same issues I had.|12782
I find it easy to connect with them sometimes, because the thoughts they have are the same ones I endure.|12782

Regardless of how awful my thoughts are (I still think about killing myself daily), I know that I am winning my battle because I would NEVER do that to the teens I work with.|12782
I can rationalize away the reactions of my family and friends (they are strong, they would get through it) but I cannot rationalize betraying so many people who have confided in me over the years.|12782
And that keeps me going, every day, every night.|12782
When the back of my mind howls at me to end it, I know that I will not -because I am living for more than just me.|12782
I am a lifeline, I can help others, and killing myself would cause more destruction that I am willing to take responsibility for.|12782
[BK][BK]Which brings me to the crux of this post: To anyone who feels worthless or numb or has no reason to live, start looking inside and outside yourself for the one thing you can seize and hold on to for dear life.|12782

The thought of putting it off for another day was like making a decision to stay on the precipice a little longer, at least until the flames reached me here, until my living became so bad that even simply surving minute-by-minute without any heart in it become too painful.|12782

oh man a thread I have an answer to.|12782
I took aprox 500 pills to try and end myself.|12782
The pills consisted of my antidepressants, allergy meds and a few other prescription i was on at the time.|12782
after taking them i fell asleep and then mid way through the night woke up and threw up some of the pills and then fell right back to sleep.|12782
After waking up again in the morning I though about why I was still alive as well as how shity I felt as the pills I took make me very  nauseous.|12782
a few interesting notes after I went to the hospital they did not have room for me so I had to wait over 24 hours after I had taken the meds before I got admitted to the emergency room and then had to drink charcoal which is single handedly the worst thing I have ever had to consume.|12782
I ever ended up going to the emergency room and then left and came back because the wait was so long.|12782
Dunno if i should have just used a throw away, but woke up, cleaned the wound, disinfected, bandaged it, and taped it.|12782
Then I cleaned the knife, cleaned the floor, ate food, and went to school.|12782
I finally thought about what I did, and just sat on top of the monkey bars.|12782
Nobody knew, there was no note, and idk i just felt empty.|12782
I guess I am fine now.|12782
Not sure if this is exactly what you are asking for because my attempt was to jump in front of a train so there had not really been a way for me to survive but I will type down my thoughts after the train passed.|12782
[BK][BK]I felt confused at first, puzzled as to why I survived what happened, then I started to cry.|12782
First it was a cry of pain and misery because I realized what I had just tried to do, then of relief and joy because my best friend saved me at the last second and pulled me away.|12782
He made me realize at that moment that despite how shitty your life may be, given some time and work and everything can be much better.|12782
Attempted school shooting.|12782
A boy brought a gun to school and held a class hostage until two other students tackled him and disarmed him.|12782
[BK]We got to see lots of different rumors fly around afterwards.|12782
The two boys were thought of as heroes in the town and another teacher bought them the fanciest class rings of there choice.|12782
When it started an assistant slipped out of the class became ambiguous whether she did it to abandon the kids to the shooter or to alert the police.|12782
Everyone had their own story of what they were doing at the time.|12782
My favorite was my friend's Archery teacher, realizing they could not hide in an open field during the lockdown, sent them with there bows and arrows to hide in the hills and bushes.|12782

I ended up panicking because I was high and out of it and bleeding and my roommate noticed and called 911.|12782

"[BK][BK]While they had me in restraints on a bed waiting for me to sober up (my blood was drawn and tested at .40 BAC) the anger turned into shame and overwhelming sadness and I just bawled like a baby in this dark room with a nurse looking in periodically."""|12782
That I did not really want to die.|12782
That it was damn selfish on my family.|12782
Seeing my dad crying by my bedside really brought it home.|12782

I saw my parents crying.|12782
I felt sorry for them, because I knew, I was going to try it again.|12782
"I am not depressed anymore, this was about 2 years ago. """|12782
I tried to crash a stolen car.|12782
It did not work after three attempts in a row .|12782
Upon realising it was not gonna happen when I could not steer anymore,  I figured it was divine intervention, I wiped a whole bunch of blood off my face and walked to the local police station to turn myself in.|12782
I remember being annoyed that my smokes were all bloody.|12782
After I would survived,  my despair was replaced by frustration,  but at the same time elation that maybe there was an undiscovered purpose as to why I am here.|12782
They had an ambulance take me to hospital where I had my head glued back together and I was released with no follow up.|12782
"But my initial thoughts were, 'God had not called my number,  so therefore intervened'"" and I would better let the cops know. """|12782
I was in denial for the longest time, so much so that I essentially convinced myself it was an accident.|12782
I only remembered my actions and thoughts leading up to that point maybe 6 months later and it was a HUGE realization.|12782
Maybe it is because I was just intoxicated all the time back then and my memory sucked but it is as if my brain actively repressed my actions leading up to it in order to spare me the pain after.|12782
Everyone was so upset and I was just.. not.|12782
It makes sense now but it made none then.|12782
My first thought was that I obviously could not tell my parents or anyone really.|12782
I went to school the next day still feelings like death and had to just push through it.|12782

It scared the fuck out of me.|12782
"So I checked myself into rehab, but relapses make me feel worse. """|12782
I remember waking up in the hospital ward confused as to why I was there, then being hit with a huge sense of shame and embarrassment.|12782
After a psych assessment I was discharged (I think they were pretty overrun - other than getting my stitches done I did not see a single doctor), my parents picked me up and I spent the whole day wishing I would succeeded.|12782
I often still do, to be honest.|12782
However, I do not think I could ever attempt anything like that again, having seen the effect it had on my family.|12782

I have only been on reddit for a week and I am almost in tears reading through this post!|12782
😢[BK][BK]Edit: seriously struggling to read through the comments now.|12782
A dear friend of mine attempted by overdosing and getting into a warm bath.|12782

"[BK][BK]She is a real fighter, that one. """|12782

Can''t even kill myself right.|12782

It's funny how suicide is illegal, just a thought...|12782
'Can't even do that right.'|12782
I need a higher roof|12782
Wow, that made a mess.|12782
And I could not even do that right either.|12782
Great.|12782
"'Well that was a bad fucking idea'""[BK][BK]I woke up with the worst headache I have ever had after downing a bottle of sleeping pills."|12782

My closest friend tried 2 times,one with drugs and another with a belt.The belt was his first try,he put it in the door and closed,so the belt make his asphyxiate,after a big headache he lost conscience and wake up sometime later.His first thought was 'how?wtf happen?|12782
"'"",sometime later he overdosed with his medication for a brain tumor,then his mom come home and see him down,take him to the hospital and become aware of the problem.Now after all that he understand why he did it and do not wanna do it again.If you have a problem please talk to someone,even if this person is online,do not take your live because your suffer end and your family''s just begin."""|12782
Fuck, fuck ok.|12782
I do not think I can do this.|12782
Asphyxiation is so much harder than it looks.|12782
Clean up.|12782
Dry your tears, take the rope off your neck.|12782
I took an overdose of klonopin and woke up in the ER restrained to the bed.|12782
I was still really out of it and i managed to get the restraints off by using my teeth and tried to leave the hospital.|12782
The security guards stopped me and had to tackle me to the ground.|12782
They then restrained my arms above my head.|12782
I must have passed out again because i woke up the next day in a psychiatric hospital.|12782
I remember thinking wtf did i do and i felt really bad about the trouble I caused the nurses and guards at the hospital.|12782
But I finally got the help I needed and with medication and counseling I am doing a lot better.|12782
After waking up in the bath I looked down and thought[BK]'Why are not I still bleeding?|12782
"'""[BK]I did not tell anyone for a few days and by that point my wrist was infected and they could not stich it because the wound had already started to heal."|12782
"Safe to say I have a gnarly scar now."""|12782
I realized I was tough to kill.|12782
The camera kept falling down at the edge of the cabinet, did not have a tripod though.|12782
Lol|12782
I wished I had succeeded.|12782
I have gotten much better over time.|12782
Throwaway account.|12782
[BK][BK]It''s alll still fresh as it happened in February.|12782
I survived a 5 storey fall.|12782
I remember waking up in hospital, barely conscious and a nurse asked me if I knew what happened.|12782
I did not so she told me.|12782
I remember distinctly thinking 'This is all a dream.|12782
I remember being on the edge of the window but I definitely turned around.|12782
"I did not jump.'"""|12782
I then lost it again.|12782
[BK][BK]But yeah, I do not remember the jump itself.|12782
My brain must have erased it from memory.|12782
Just standing on the edge of the window, then looking back into the room... and I was convinced I took a step back but I did not.|12782
I truly wish I had.|12782
[BK][BK]Oh, and I remember the last thing anyone said to me beforehand.|12782
My muum calling me on the phone, telling me to call her if I was feeling down - she knew I was not in the best place then.|12782
"How I wish I had called her instead.[BK][BK]Nevermind."""|12782
A friend of mine jumped off a bridge as a troubled teenager but thankfully survived as he miscalculated and landed on a heap of bonfire ashes beside the river.|12782
"He told me how when first asked by paramedics if he was allergic to anything he said 'heights'""."|12782
"[BK]He doing great now, has his own business."""|12782
I felt angry and hurt- almost like I had been cheated somehow.|12782
Then all I could think about was how overwhelmingly disappointed and upset my family and friends would be with me.|12782

"'Great, even managed to fuck that up!'"""""|12782
"After the blackness cleared from my eyes, my first thought was 'welp, smells like dinner is ready'""."|12782
Then I went downstairs and ate.|12782

I jumped off the bench and then felt the belt tighten, then it fucking snapped and I fell onto my knees.|12782
"My first thought was '"" if i was not so fucking fat I would be dead now'""."|12782
Went inside and just laid in bed watching the event over and over in my head.|12782
[BK][BK]Kinda annoyed at myself for failing.|12782
"My only regret is that I did not use a proper rope"""|12782
thank you all for sharing.|12782
this is a heartbreaking read.|12782
every story is important.|12782
Not for a minute do I think I could even try and help, except to listen to what you have to say and give you a huge hug|12782
"'I fucked up'""[BK][BK]I have had 3 attempts, and none of them even came close to working."|12782
"Swallowing a bottle of pills did not even make me sick."""|12782
The first time I had been called in the night by my parents telling me my sister was put in a mental hospital, I called that next day and told her I love her and would be able to talk any time (as I usually tell her whenever I see her).|12782
When I got the same call again this last week, well, I still have not called her.|12782
I spent all of my spring break driving out to her and my moms new home.|12782
I do not know, I just want to help.|12782
My most recent attempt was new years day and that was also my most serious out of 4 times I tried in the last year.|12782
I woke up on the way to the hospital and when I realised I did not really think anything or do anything, I just sat there for about 7 hours not saying a word just really pissed off that I was still here then about 2 hours after I got to the hospital it suddenly clicked that I am going to have to have a blood test and I fainted, do not really remember anything after that apart from when I got home and made mash potato at like 6:30am... All in all kinda a shit night but in a way I am happy I did it.|12782
although I got everything else right, I had not cut deep enough... apparently I was not prepared for how many nerve endings are in the underside of the arm... the first thing I thought had to be, fear of my mother...|12782
"I had gotten blood on a white towel, she would also be angry because, 'what would people think of her'"" was more important than my wellbeing[BK][BK]I went through months of humiliating strip searches for cuts after that"""|12782
My first try i took a ton of asprin, its all i could get, took more than the od limit and just went to sleep...it didnt work and the next day i realized how fucked up everything is hanging out with my one friend in a world of pain (physical) thinking i really need to go to a hospital so i didnt die in his yard.|12782
I didnt and survived.|12782
Many years and attempts later then something just happened and im not as fucked up as i used to be.|12782
I have plenty of scars on my arm to remind me of where i came from, ive thought about getting a tattoo to cover them but they mean more to me than any tattoo could.|12782
I jumped into the road, then I jumped out of it when I thought of my mum and sisters and and how devastated they would be|12782
I was pissed.|12782
the last time I tried to kill myself I took a monster shot of dope...|12782
If I remember correctly when I woke up I thought a combination of I cannot feel my arms/legs (I was laying on them in a weird position for a while)/ how the FUCK am I still alive?|12782
?/ holy shit I am gonna puke... / god fucking damnit I am still alive...|12782
'...shit.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I apparently had not known what I was doing, because I woke up that next morning with nothing more than a terrible headache and an uneasy stomach."|12782
I tried to go to lunch anyway, stuck between planning on doing it again and running to the campus counselor.|12782
[BK][BK]When I was standing in line some girl asked me how I was doing.|12782
"Didn''t even know her, but I croaked '""oh, you know, I am alive'"" before I thought about what I was saying, and proceeded directly to the school counselor after that, because the fact that I COULD still say '""I am alive'"" freaked me the hell out."""|12782
First thought?|12782
Christ, I cannot do anything right.|12782
Mom had always told me I would kill myself, and that I was useless, so one of my first thoughts was 'I guess she is right again'|12782
'what have I done?|12782
"How and why did I let this happen?'"""|12782
"it was the biggest turning point in my life..."""|12782
A couple interesting things.|12782
"[BK][BK]I thought how stupid I was, how 'she'"" (a friend of mine) would think of me, and I also realized that if I die now I give myself a 0% chance to make anything better."|12782
It''s been 6 years and nothing has gotten better, but what are the chances if I live another 30, another 70?|12782
I mean, I do not want to waste my youth but I would rather give it a chance.|12782
If I am happy for a moment it is better than what would have been for an instant.|12782
[BK][BK]I do not believe in an afterlife, so this life is all I have for myself.|12782
I would rather try and fail, instead of not trying at all.|12782
If someone was holding a gun to your head and offered to step back 30 feet and let you try and dodge, would you take it, or let them shoot you point blank?|12782
That''s me.|12782
[BK][BK]My method was starvation.|12782
Let me tell you, that shit hurts, and it is slow, and it felt like I deserved it.|12782
"[BK][BK]I think my stomach is still fucked up from that."""|12782
I have to face my problems now but at least I will be taken seriously.|12782
Didn't want to think.|12782
Just reacted.|12782
I immediately felt betrayed by my boyfriend at the time (who found me and called the police).|12782
Then it became overwhelming guilt to how much pain I caused him.|12782
That sunk in more and more as time passed.|12782
We got back together after the incident.|12782
I felt sick around him because I was stupidly selfish that day.|12782
I do not remember doing it.|12782
My therapist said I disassociated.|12782
When I realised what was happening, I was sitting on the floor of my room with empty prescription packets infront of me.|12782
I tried to pick myself off the floor but could not.|12782
I had to scream for my parents - I did not want to die.|12782
Yes, I was depressed, yes I thought about it a lot - but I did not want this.|12782
[BK][BK]But while I regretted it then, I do not regret it now.|12782
That moment was my wake up call.|12782
I broke up with my abusive ex, hired a personal trainer and got a job.|12782
Life is good now.|12782
I am happy again.|12782
[BK][BK]|12782
Shit.|12782
"'I failed'""[BK]I was genuinely mad at myself."""|12782
I should not have wasted so many hydros just having a good time.|12782
"I tried to OD but i guess my body was so used to the drugs (xanax and oxy mix) and I woke up to my mom saying 'you need to stop falling asleep at the computer'""."|12782
She was none the wiser.|12782
I was kinda mad it didnt do anything but that day I was suddenly flushed with optimism and changed ever since.|12782
"My first thought was '""oh damnit im still in my human body'""."""|12782
"'fuck'""."|12782
That was it.|12782
"I was pretty cut up that I would made it through."""|12782
I even mamaged to fuck this up.|12782
That I was being stupid and should embrace life as such.|12782
(I also suffer from tanathophoby, so its a pretty fucked up thing, though I dislike talking about it).|12782
Everything had an answer, and I would not always be so sad.|12782
Life was precious, even if I hated it.|12782
Resistance is futile.|12782
Late to this party but...[BK][BK]'Oh my god, I need to hide this.|12782
"No one can know.'"""|12782
And I did and I have never told my family what almost happened.|12782
"I was 14. """|12782
Relief.|12782
[BK][BK]I tried to crash my auto and die at 100+ mph, but I hit the breaks like 50 meter before and tried to steer away from crashing into a tree (I made sure to crash where I would have hurt nobody else but me).|12782
I was going too fast tho and I lost control over the car nonetheless, car was destroyed I was unscratched.|12782
[BK][BK]I felt huge relief, and I had 5 amazing years after.|12782
[BK][BK]My biggest fear to break was not to spare my life tho, but the fact that I could remain paralized or something and live an even worst life.|12782
[BK][BK]But after you are close to dying you appreciate being alive and see things differently, so I lost my intentions to kill myself.|12782
For a week or two afterwards, there was a certain out of body experiences.|12782
Well fuck, I will just take more... still has not worked, fairly confident I am immortal.|12782
50 20mil hydros in one day and all I did was get high.|12782
Come on kidneys shut down, am I right?|12782
I was and still am pissed.|12782
All the stuff i have to go through now because i failed to do it right|12782
My parents are gonna kill me|12782
"I am pretty sure I thought to my self something along the lines of 'This does not look like hell?'"""|12782
Or something like that.|12782
"I am just really glad that I did not do it right."""|12782
I wish i could kill myself every day.|12782
I just turned 27 on the 6th...and I have not tried to do anything since I was a teen...But, I will never forget the morning where I woke up and realized I had to get rid of my note, then explain to my mom why her medication that she just got refilled was already gone.|12782
(I had attempted to overdose and...just got a good night's sleep out of it instead)[BK][BK]It was just a mixture of shame, but also at the same time... relief that I was still here to feel that shame.|12782
[BK][BK]These days every one of them might not be sunny, but I have learned to take them as they come.|12782
honestly?|12782
"it was something along the lines of 'fuck I am not dead'"""""|12782
From the way things were looking in the hospital room (clearly I misconstrued the situation) I thought I was being arrested.|12782
My first thought was of the dread of loosing my job because I would have to call from the police station.|12782
I am a severely depressed person, but I have an extremely close online friend of mine who is suffering just as much if not more.|12782
Thanks to all the stories it really clicked in my head.|12782
I told her that I love her and how I would hate to see her go.|12782
[BK]Thanks everyone.|12782
Hmm I did not realise until a lot later but now my left ribs are impacted and I have trouble breathing sometimes.|12782
"'this will be difficult to explain'""[BK]I would attempted to strangle myself with a belt, but it broke, all the blood vessels in my face had burst and as such had to spend the next 2 weeks making out it was an allergic reaction. """|12782
Pissed off that I had been shaken a million times with no response, paramedics were phoned when I would have preferred to just sleep and not wake up.|12782
Oh fuck.|12782
I did not make it...|12782
I went to Catholic school during middle school.|12782
The church has a wall full of different pamphlets.|12782
One day I saw one on suicide and picked it up because I will read pretty much anything.|12782
Some kids saw me reading it, your my step-mom, a teacher there,  who told my dad.|12782
I got a big lecture that night.|12782
I had never even considered suicide before that.|12782
But if they all thought I was capable of it, maybe I was.|12782
Do I tried drowning myself a free times over the next month, could not do it.|12782
I did not know why I was doing it.|12782
I have just always felt like there was something wrong with me.|12782
[BK][BK]My first year of highschool, I was depressed for a reason I no longer remember.|12782
After months of feeling empty I chased a bottle of over the counter sleeping pills with half a bottle of crown.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up a little more or less than three days later in my tub, covered in whiskey scented vomit.|12782
[BK][BK]To this day, I have no clue why I survived.|12782
Maybe there was not enough pills left in the bottle.|12782
To this day I still wretch when I rake pills.|12782
[BK][BK]My first thought was 'why the fuck has not my mom been home yet?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I did not have any missed calls or emails from anyone."|12782
[BK][BK]About five years ago I was running errands or something.|12782
I was at an intersection and saw a semi coming.|12782
I took my foot of the brake to roll in front of it, and stopped myself because I was in my moms car.|12782
[BK][BK]A couple weeks ago, I had the barrel of my 20 gauge in mouth, lips wrapped around the choke, racked a shell into the barrel.|12782
[BK][BK]Thought to myself do it, do it, come on, it will only hurt for a second if at all.|12782
DO IT!|12782
[BK][BK]I took the safety off with my heel, and my next thought was that if I went through with it, when my grandma or someone came to clean the house out after I am gone, they are going to find my fleshlights, and I did not want to be remembered that way.|12782
"So I spent the next hour throwing myself in front of cars in GTA V until the urge passed. """|12782
I felt stupid that I chickened out and drove myself to the ER to get my stomach pumped.|12782
Well, my parents saw what I was going to try and do and they stopped me.|12782
I felt powerless and nihillistic, like I could not change anything.|12782
Still do, minus...wanting to kill myself.|12782
'Shit they can see my arms' [BK]I was forced to wear only a gown while in hospital and my parents saw the extent of my self harming for.|12782
the first time.|12782
After that I realised I would be forced back into therapy and the numbness broke as I lost it.|12782

[BK][BK]She made me go with her to dinner.|12782
"I was falling asleep at the table and she said it was exhaustion from school."""|12782
I guess the first thought was how I would explain it.|12782
What excuse would I make up to make it seem like an accident.|12782
[BK][BK]Only attempt my parents got wind of was when I slit my wrists.|12782
They got home earlier than I thought.|12782
I was really scared and in pain both emotional and physical.|12782
Of course they rushed me to the ER.|12782
Then to a psych hospital.|12782
Where I was wrongfully diagnosed with bipolar disorder and given medication for it.|12782
Which just fucked me up more.|12782
[BK][BK]Second attempt I went out on new years all alone and drank myself into a stupor and walked around the shitty parts of town hoping someone did my dirty work for me.|12782
I am a coward.|12782
I eventually passed out and a group of kids found me, took my phone and called my parents.|12782
They waited with me until they arrived.|12782
[BK][BK]Most attempts after that involved pill overdoses but I always got scared and threw them up.|12782
[BK][BK]The last attempt involved an allergic reaction.|12782
I knew I was allergic to THC and smart shops had just started popping up.|12782
I convinced this douchebag friend of my so that I was imune to weed.|12782
He went out of his way to prove me wrong, mixed a whole bunch of shit in a pipe and gave it to me.|12782
It was probably the most terrifying attempt to date.|12782
I started hallucinating and could not stand.|12782
My stomach was churning and I felt like I was losing my sight.|12782
I do not remember the hospital ride.|12782
I hardly remember anything other than blacking out a lot and being conscious for a few minutes at a time.|12782
My body hurt a lot, I had tubes and IVs all over me.|12782
My parents were there staring at me like I was a criminal.|12782
[BK][BK]Apparently I had a series of cardiac arrests.|12782
It was the closest I got.|12782
All I could think of was on what was I going to pin this on this time.|12782
[BK][BK]I am too much of a coward to do anything anymore.|12782
The depression and anxiety medication I got also helps.|12782
[BK][BK]I still think I do not belong.|12782
Hopefully lung cancer is in my future and does what I am too chicken to do.|12782
Background: In September 2014 i attempted to hang myself with a belt from a coat hook.|12782
The only reason i survived was because i managed to rip said hook out the wall when i fell.|12782
"[BK][BK][BK]My first thought afterwards was 'Shit, my parents are going to be so mad when they see this.'"""""|12782
I tried using three bottles of shiskey and five boxes of painkillers (which was like 60 tablets) and I remember checking my pulse, breathing into a mirror and basically doing everything to check and see if there was evsn the slightest chance my disappointment was premature.|12782
My exact waking thoughts were 'no no no' for about five minutes.|12782
[BK][BK]I had the house to myself for a few days at that point so fortunately i didnt have to explain the empty boxes of painkillers and drink; but instead decided to chat to my American pen pal.|12782
Thats when we made the pact that the only time we are allowed to go through with it is if were in the same room, goingthrough with it together.|12782
At the time I was really depressed having been bullied for years because I only have one kidney (hey, 16 year olds will pick just about any reason they can).|12782
'You fucking idiot.|12782
"Of course you botched even this....'"" --in the car on the way to the hospital[BK][BK]I was really pissed."|12782
I attempted a few months ago--November 28 to be precise.|12782
I go can go into details if people ask (I am in a much better place now and have no problem talking about it), but I am in a bit of a hurry.|12782
[BK][BK]Anyways...my parents had me put in a psych ward for six days, which was a complete waste of time and an utterly miserable experience.|12782
I did not eat the whole time I was there and barely slept thanks to this kid that would scream and beat the walls and himself whenever someone turned the TV off.|12782
One of my only friends in there was this 11 year old that I played chess with during our free time, and he tried to drown himself in his sink while I was there.|12782
So I just focused all of my energy on lying my way out of there.|12782
[BK][BK]Then I had partial hospitalization, which is basically group therapy that you are required to go to that is at the hospital.|12782
That was actually fun, oddly enough--put a bunch of fucked up teenagers in a room together (I was 17,  18 now) and hilarity ensues.|12782
As far as the therapeutic aspect of it, though, there really was not much value.|12782
Same goes for traditional therapy; I only go to my therapist because my parents make me, it is honestly completely useless.|12782
[BK][BK]All told, I missed two months of school.|12782
Most people still have no idea why.|12782
And a word of advice to anyone who is stuck where I was?|12782
Talk to people.|12782
The number one thing that I have taken from this whole experience is that even the people you do not think care about you at all, do.|12782
And even though I still have some down days, they are nowhere near as bad and overall I am very happy now, thanks to my girlfriend (who is pretty much the most incredible person I have ever met) and medication.|12782
Feel free to PM me if you had like if you just need someone to listen (or read, I suppose).|12782
[BK][BK]Sorry if there is any formatting issues; I am on my phone.|12782
I will check for replies later.|12782
"[BK][BK]"""|12782
"For me I was just like 'huh... Oh well.'"""|12782
And I moved on.|12782
It was weird, I was not that sad about it and have not tried again.|12782
"I am not super thankful, if I succeeded that would have been fine, but I am also fine with having not succeeded."""|12782
Well shit now I feel even worse... Fuck me.|12782
Drank a bottle of wine and popped a handful of sleeping pills and laid in the slower.|12782
My boyfriend at the time came by my place when I did not answer my phone to check on me and made me throw up.|12782
I just remember feeling humiliated and embarrassed.|12782
I am glad it did not work now, but at the time I was so embarrassed.|12782
My stomach(/liver?)|12782
Hurt for a good 2 weeks after the incident.|12782
I went to counseling afterwards and I mostly try to not let anyone know about it.|12782
"I remember waking up in the water (I jumped off of the Golden Gate Bridge) and I thought 'how ironic that seconds ago I wanted to die and I did not, now I find myself struggling to survive and I am going to drown'"". """|12782
"'Holy shit, I am immortal.'"""""|12782
I could not take the breath.|12782
I tried to drown myself in the tub 4 times and each time I could not make myself breathe in or stay under long enough to pass out.|12782
Not again.|12782
At first i was actually pretty disappointed that it did not work.|12782
.. but a few minutes later my patents came in just to check on me.|12782
That alone made me glad i did not.|12782
But i was one of the only white kids in my school in the deep south at the time.|12782
So I would get beat up almost every day at either recess p.e.|12782
or lunch,  or walking between Classes, or before and after school,  or when i went out to play.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]But eventually we moved and things got way better.|12782
'Well shit.|12782
"Now she is gonna take me to the hospital to get my stomach pumped.'"""""|12782
"'Fuck, I cannot even do this right.'"""""|12782
Shit just another thing I am bad at!|12782
"'Why?'"""|12782
[BK][BK]This is kind of hard for me to talk about, but when I was 15 I tried to commit suicide with a double barrel shotgun.|12782
It misfired twice.|12782
"My life has turned around since then, and I am glad that I did not go. """|12782
I remember looking out the door to my apartment into the eyes of a stranger as they closed the door.|12782
Next thing I remember I woke up and puked my guts out over and over.|12782
No one new what I tried and no one ever did [BK]I was so numb and on auto pilot.|12782
I still do not know why I tried and I still do not understand.|12782
That was 12 years ago [BK]|12782
Wondering what my parents will say|12782
I had felt peaceful to be honest.|12782
Also I had a huge headache.|12782
I would taken about two handfuls of Tylenol pm and as I laid in bed I could feel things shutting down.|12782
Especially my heartbeat, that was the most surreal thing.|12782
Feeling it beating so slowly, and feeling as if I was in a dreamlike state.|12782
I shut my eyes and waited to die, and when it never happened I woke up and went on with the day business as usual.|12782
I tried two more times before giving up on the whole idea.|12782
Had a mental breakdown which I could not hide from my parents so they helped me get the help I obviously needed.|12782
These days things are better and I am not suicidal anymore.|12782
I still suffer from anxiety but I have learned how to manage it.|12782
I realised all my cats were clustered around me on the bed; and shortly after that, that my sister and dad had not noticed I would hidden myself away in my bedroom for two days.|12782
[BK][BK]I miss my cats.|12782
I do not have any where I live now.|12782
I would tried before, and tried since; my first attempt was at six (if you could call it an attempt: I got hungry and went home), and my last attempt was four years ago.|12782
I have thought about it a lot since, but not been 'proactive' in some time.|12782
Pure shock and terror once i realized the gun had jammed on me.|12782
Then I got so pissed at shit fucking up on me that I went and kicked a hole in the wall in our bathroom where I was at the time.|12782
Got in alot of trouble for that hole, mostly because I refused to tell my parents why I had gotten so mad to kick the wall in the first place.|12782
They still dont know why...|12782
I took a whole bottle of about 500 aspirin, which probably saved me because it was just wayyy too much and my body threw up most of it.|12782
I had a horrible night and when I woke up in the hospital I just thought about my mom and how sad I have made her.|12782
It's what keeps me from trying again.|12782
I want to, but I have already hurt my body and my parents a lot.|12782
If I fail again it will just hurt everything even more.|12782
I lost all my friends after that and I have not seemed to be able to get any more.|12782
It's been about 10 years.|12782
I am struggling, but look, I am here.|12782
"'fuck'"""""|12782
Holy crap I feel like shit, at least it is the weekend.|12782
Turned out it was like Wednesday.|12782
Was pretty crap.|12782
Basically it was along the lines of hating my self for trying to throw away a great life, and willing to hurt every one that loves me because I could not deal with life on my own.|12782
My mind was going a million miles a minute after I resized the gun jammed.|12782
I cried and was horrified at how my family was going to treat me.|12782
I had sworn to my mom I would not abuse my medicine anymore and I permanently broke her trust.|12782
"'I fucking knew I should have used the revolver'""."|12782
"Long story short, semi automatic pistols can fail to fire if you are a fuck-up turkey and bury the slide to far into your head."""|12782

[BK][BK]It was a spotlight, shining through stained glass.|12782
The Front Door.|12782
[BK][BK]I knew I had messed up.|12782
It was the police, who''d been notified earlier about what was going on.|12782
[BK][BK]For a while, I did not feel like I was making conscious thoughts.|12782
"I was just floating around from motion to motion."""|12782
I tried to kill myself with a combination of 6mg of an unknown NBOMe compound and 1g of Benadryl.|12782
This led to an eight hour bout of delirium where my heart rate was sky high and regret filled me.|12782
I realised I did not want to die, I was just tired of living and I was blinded by sorrow and anger.|12782
My parents found me screaming on the floor at some unknown entity comparable to sleep paralysis hallucinations, a feeling of unparalleled malevolence.|12782
When the experience was coming to an end I began to drift into a sleep that lasted a little over a day.|12782
I woke up in a hospital bed to to the soft beep of an ekg and restraints.|12782

How disappointed is my dad.|12782
He sat with me in the Er and remains in denial to this day.|12782
I took a whole bunch of pills and slept for 16 hours.|12782
Woke up and cried all day because i realized i failed again.|12782
That was the last time i tried|12782
I took a whole bunch of pills and my boyfriend happened to come home early and intervened.|12782
I woke up in my bed alone and feeling worse than I did before I tried to kill myself.|12782
I wanted to do it again but there were no more pills so I drove to a mental health facility and admitted myself.|12782
I am such a fucking pussy.|12782
[BK][BK]Id tried several times in several different ways, but basically always backed out before it got too late.|12782

When I was 15 I had just learned I had adhd, autism, a sleep disorder, and I felt really alone.|12782
I had seen something on Youtube a while ago about how people fall alseep while in airplanes, so my plan was to put my head in a garbage bag full of air and go to sleep.|12782
When everything was ready and I was going to sleep, all I could think about was that I really missed my mom.|12782
I broke down, and my girlfriend had called the police because I had said goodbye, and I am ok.|12782
Pure fear|12782
I overdosed.|12782
I figured if I woke up I would give up the lifestyle I would been living and make a real change.|12782
If I died, then it was finally over and that was just as good to me.|12782
I am so glad now that I made it through that night.|12782
"I woke up and thought 'Well, it is time to make a change.'"""|12782
"And I did."""|12782
After I tried, I did not really go unconscious but I was sort of in a haze.|12782
I had slit my left arm with a razor blade in my bathroom, and when the skin actually broke I was just shocked.|12782
[BK][BK]I am not sure if it was because I did not actually expect myself to go through with it or not, but as soon as I did I just froze.|12782
I stopped crying and just kind of stared at my arm for a while.|12782
[BK][BK]I finally realized the cut was not going to kill me, but I did know I would need medical attention.|12782
I told my stepdad and he was great about it and drove me to the hospital.|12782
"He later told me I kept saying 'Please do not hate me, I am sorry'"" and he just kept telling me it was okay."|12782
[BK][BK]I am fine now.|12782
I am in a great place in my life and I do not have these thoughts anymore.|12782

Spelling|12782
Nothing profound, just a realisation that if the overdose was not going to kill me it might just do long term damage that would be inconvenient so I would best go get some help.|12782
At the time I had not done the reading so thought I was just going to drop dead within an hour or two of taking loads of paracetamol.|12782
Turns out paracetamol overdose can take a few days to kill you.|12782
For me it was like waking up from a bad dream, I was terrified and disoriented.|12782
I did not know where I was, and I was horrified about what I might have done.|12782

They took me to the hospital, and while my parents beat my ass after i got out and said next time i try that shit i better die or they will do it for me, my brother was destroyed.|12782
Seeing how badly it fucked him up, and seeing how i could not just ditch him and leave him to our parents, made me realize i need to stay to protect him and my lil sis.|12782

As i was approaching the platform at about 50km/h he dropped his school bag and dove out in front of me .|12782
I hit emergency brake straight away and put 2 carriages over the top of him but by some insane fluke of luck or not depending how you look at it he landed right between both rails and straight away he came crawling out covered in grease like nothing happened ... Was intense !|12782
He was screaming lifes not worth living .|12782
I just want to die .|12782
Just kill me .... he lived to fight another day and still had all of his limbs ... No idea what became of him but he was only about 12 or 13 years old ... Was in school uniform and all ... shocking thing to experience|12782
When I was 13 I took a handful of sleeping pills, cut my wrists and got in a bath.|12782

Wow, there are a lot of negative people in this thread.|12782
Bumming me out.|12782
I am 17 now, my first attempt was at 16, it was pretty pathetic, I thought that downing 25 pills in a go would kill me, but it just gave me extremely bad pains the next day and I was vomiting for a while.|12782
I felt gutted above all else that I cannot even kill myself properly.|12782
The first thought for me was I cannot believe I am still here, I did not think it was real at all.|12782

Plus I woke up when the meds came to get me from my place and I was in my underwear.|12782
I insisted on putting on pants and then lost consciousness again.|12782

[BK][BK]A week after we moved mom started disappearing.|12782
She could be gone anywhere from 12 hours to 5 days.|12782
There was no way of knowing when, if or in what kind of state she would come home.|12782
We had no support, we knew no one and I did what I had to.|12782
I stopped going to school to take care of the baby and I walked to the food bank every 2 days with a wagon to get some food.|12782
My mom eventually came back but was mostly catatonic; I was used to it, she would realize she fucked up then spiral into a deep depression and forget we existed.|12782
She might as well have stayed gone.|12782
[BK][BK]At 13 I was aware that my life was probably not going to get much better than this.|12782
I loved my little sister and I tolerated my annoying brother, but to them I was an essential need.|12782
I fed them, tucked them in at night, tried to get my brother to the bus on time, went to the food bank, shoplifted the items I could not find at the food bank etc.|12782
My life sucked.|12782
[BK][BK]The week I decided I would had enough was 8 months after we had moved to this 'new beginning'.|12782
The school had called and I answered, they wanted to set up a parent teacher meeting about my brother because at 11 he had shown up to school drunk and high.|12782
We set it up and I said my mom would be there.|12782
I knew she would not she was not even home.|12782
I decided I would go instead; the teacher did not take it well.|12782
She did not for one second consider that I was trying to do the right thing for my brother, she assumed it was a prank/joke.|12782
Trying to convince the teachers that I was my mom say I left crying and they were calling my mom (good luck).|12782
[BK][BK]I went home feeling defeated and completely useless.|12782
I knew I was basically done with school.|12782
The teachers were figuring out slowly that something was wrong and I knew from stories my mom had told; my innocent baby sister was going to get taken away and my brother would be thrown in the system and if I was lucky I would not go to jail for stealing.|12782
I was 13 and really did not have any reason to believe otherwise.|12782
I was scared and could feel my world crumbling.|12782
[BK][BK]If I could have kept my brother out of trouble, if I could have helped my mom, maybe if I would been smarter.. all the questions of a 13 year old way way over her head.|12782
I decided that I was the problem and I really did not want to go to jail.|12782
Everything was going to change, i miggt never see my family again.|12782
I was desperate.|12782
So i decided my best plan was to end my life on my terms.|12782
[BK][BK]I got all of mom's crazy pills from before dad left and some crazy new ones from the last few weeks, I grabbed a pop from the 711 across the street and downed as many pills as I could.|12782
My brother called 911 when he got home.|12782
It was grotesque, I was almost dead surrounded by vomit, my eyes were completely red from the vomiting and I was barely weazing.|12782
(I have no recollection of any of this).|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up in the hospital was a cps worker and no one else.|12782
I had never once considered surviving and now here I was, I had ruined my family.|12782
I had ruined my education, I couldnt help my mom, I had ruined my own suicide.|12782
I was useless and now we were all going to be taken away and I would be truly alone.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]|12782
'Well, shit.|12782
Guess I am going to a psych ward for a few months.|12782
I wonder if I can escape?|12782
There''s two guards outside my room and I have no idea what the floor plan for this place is.....so no.|12782
"Shit.'"""""|12782
Similar story here, attempted at 15 while stuck in an abusive relationship.|12782
tried to hang myself on lawnmower cord but got resuscitated by someone who found me.|12782
suffered major oxygen deprivation and lost the feeling in left leg from spinal cord damage.|12782
[BK] other than sheer panic I couldnt remember my name I just remember regret the moment I let go of the branch and the overpowering need to continue living - for everyone I love.|12782
[BK]Now 17, rid of all abuse and well on my way through recovery.|12782
love life now.|12782
It gets better!|12782
I hope the morphene they are giving my for pain stops me from breathing.|12782
I have bit long story behind my suicide attempts.|12782
There were 3 in total, but i tell you from first of them.|12782
I know, my english might be bit sluggish... but, i just want to share this story of mine.|12782
To help all who struggles with same feelings i had, (and traumas i cannot still get rid of)[BK][BK]I was only 12 and middle of may.|12782
Spring was coming and darkness of winter passed by.|12782
At that point, i was bullied for 3 years.|12782
Lived in fear of people coming to hurt me and making fun of my clothing, appearance or my attitude to nature.|12782
I like nature, and always escaped into woods and climbed tree so high so bad people i hated could not to climb.|12782
[BK]One day, like eny other day.|12782
It started.|12782
I do not know the real reason they pick me.|12782
but several months later i was mentally so broken, that i wanted to just pass by.|12782
Unnoticed and become part of shadows.|12782
[BK]This is how they killed my bright and smiley me: I got trapped by this one group.|12782
They made circle around me so i cannot escape.|12782
They pushed me back in middle of circle if i tried.|12782
"They started to poke me with names: 'Treehugger'"", and many more rude and humiliating ones."|12782
I shouted help and cried.|12782
Then i saw through my teary eyes the first punch.|12782
These people never let me go before hurting.|12782
"Leaders '""right hand'"" started it."|12782
He punched me in shoulder (i was able to dodge it somehow, or otherwise it would be head) Then circle of bad, shouting ppl started to rage.|12782
I leave rest to your imagination to cover, I am still too broken to tell it in actual words.|12782
This kind of bullying i was trapped in 3 years.|12782
[BK][BK]I felt miserable.|12782
I wanted my abuse to stop.|12782
I told my parents about that but they thought i was exaggerating the problem and they did not believe it entirely.|12782
Only idea i came up with was killing myself, since pain mental and physical i felt was far more greater than killing myself would cause.|12782
[BK]So, i jumped of bridge, in water, (from 34m high) and i wanted to drown to death.|12782
I know, I had pretty decent percent to survive, and so i did.|12782
Water did hit me unconscious.|12782
[BK][BK]I woke up in one shore of that river.|12782
I was wet, my head was pounding, i puked water out of my lungs and stomach and i was alive.|12782
I floated almost 1km from bridge i jumped off.|12782
"My first thoughts was:[BK]'""Why this thing what is me, should be alive?"|12782
"'""[BK]'""Now they find this out and starts making fun of '""rivermaid'""[BK]'""I do not want to live in world of fear and pain."|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I was not happy at all."|12782
I dried my cloths in early springs sun.|12782
Walked home, and went to shower.|12782
Put new clothes on and cried in my bed for rest of day until i fell asleep.|12782
In morning my lungs hurt, i was sick since i caught cold and i did''t speak a word what i had done.|12782
I was so shocked i could not talk in month.|12782
This was the point my parents really realized all i said was truth.|12782
I was sent to psychologist and my parents tried to make me talk again, to tell names of bad ppl.|12782
I never even realized they had names.|12782
So, i remained silent.|12782
[BK][BK]And i still fear them.|12782
Now, they are just nightmares.|12782
But they do not go away.|12782
Currently I am 19.|12782
And still.|12782
"Time heals wounds, but sometimes too deep ones keeps ache years."""|12782
When I was 14 I tried to hang myself from my ceiling fan, I hung for about 3 seconds before the fan broke and I ended up on the ground.|12782
[BK]My first thought was 'Well shit, looks like I am stuck here.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]My dad made me replace the ceiling fan on my own."""|12782
"'I guess I am stuck here, then.'"""""|12782
I cried, and immediately called my mother to talk to my little sister.|12782
She had just turned four and did not understand (obviously) but hearing her snapped me out of everything.|12782
It's been a bit over a year, not a single attempt or real thought of it since.|12782
"'Wow, I even fucked this up'"""""|12782
It was too much for me.|12782
I could not read much.|12782
You reminded me of very dark times.|12782
I am not about 5-6 years after, and only recently, very recently, did I take my first real step to recovery.|12782
[BK][BK]As I did not read much, I hope you are better now.|12782
"'Oh fucking come on... More bullshit to deal with.'"""""|12782
I rolled the dice.|12782
Didn't work.|12782
Wondered what I was going to have for lunch[BK][BK][BK]Edit - more info as I realise everyone is sharing a lot of info.|12782
[BK][BK]Riding my solo down the freeway crying in my helmet.|12782
Sick of this feeling.|12782
Everything is pointless and that was not ok with me.|12782
I decided to close my eyes and count to ten.|12782
Whatever happens, happens.|12782
Russian roulette on the freeway in other words.|12782
Counted to ten.|12782
Opened my eyes and I would merged two lanes across around a long sweeping corner.|12782
kept riding to work.|12782
Thought about lunch for some reason.|12782
[BK][BK]And yes I understand putting others in danger etc with this nuttery.|12782
Didnt stop me.|12782
After all a dead person cannot care I reasoned.|12782
I was devestated when the nurse told me I was going to be alright.|12782
Absolutely crushed.|12782
"My first thought was 'How can I do it right?'""."|12782
I immediately began planning for a second attempt.|12782
Thankfully, I was not given the opportunity and was sent to a psychiatric facility for a couple of weeks until I was stabilized.|12782
"I now thank God I was so unsuccessful and that I did not have a second chance. """|12782
I hung myself when I was 17.|12782
I do not remember my first waking thought (I woke up in intensive care after a coma) and the first thing that does come to find is the absolute fear I had of when I was in the coma or dead, and how much of a fool I was.|12782
It was my fifth and last attempt for my life.|12782
I just want to say it is not worth it.|12782
At all.|12782
The pain you put your loved ones through is ridiculous.|12782
If you ever have the urge, tell somebody, please.|12782
Too many people suffer.|12782
I remember just wondering why I was where I was.|12782
Both physically and mentally.|12782
It was like walking out of a tunnel.|12782
I screamed and cried and begged for answers.|12782
Why did it have to be like this?|12782
When would it end?|12782
The reason it was always me?|12782
I do not know what I wanted or what I needed.|12782
My only thoughts were that I had to get out of this predicament.|12782
This was a weird attempt from the beginning.|12782
'fuck even this I cannot do right!|12782
"'""[BK][BK]It''s been 8 years."|12782
"Going stronger than ever."""|12782
My first thought when waking up in the ICU.|12782
Fuck I have failed at suicide too.|12782
I have failed at even failing.|12782
[BK][BK]I am doing much better now after 7 years of treatment.|12782
A month ago I successfully terminated counseling.|12782
So improvement takes time is what I'be learned.|12782
"'I need help.'"""|12782
"Luckily I got it."""|12782
"'Great, I cannot even fucking kill myself right'""[BK][BK]It''s been 10 years since my last attempt, which was my third attempt."|12782
[BK]I still think about it all the time, because even after 16 years of treatment I am still miserable; I am convinced I just cannot get better anymore.|12782
[BK][BK]Honestly I am only around now, because I do not want to hurt my family.|12782
I will probably hang myself after my dad dies.|12782
"[BK]I accepted a long time ago my disease will probably kill me."""|12782
Late to the conversation, but you may enjoy hearing [Kevin Hines''](http://www.kevinhinesstory.com/) story.|12782
Not sure if the video is on his site, but we play it for the Youth Mental Health First Aid training.|12782
In his story, he jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge:[BK][BK]From memory....[BK][BK]'Immediately after my hands and feet had left the ledge, the voice in my head [persecutor/paranoid hallucination due to bi-polar disorder] was gone!|12782

"Pretty powerful clip if it is on there."""|12782

"I ended up waking up a few hours later and throwing everything up, and the first thing I thought was 'Wow, I cannot even kill myself right.'"""""|12782
"I know i am too late but i woke up on the stretcher on the way to ambulance and went 'fuck i cant be alive wtf fuck fuck fuck'"" and then proceeded  to hold my breath and tried to avoid breathing thru the oxygen mask and then started crying hysterically lol"""|12782
So shit seemed terrible for me.|12782
The first time I tried I was 16.|12782
I decided that I was going to hang myself in a garage with an extension cord.|12782
I threw it up over a rafter, tied it off on the end and then made the noose.|12782
I got on a milk crate, put the cord around my neck and dropped.|12782
What I did not realize was that I did not account for slack and instead of breaking my neck I instead hit the ground and ended up bruising my tailbone.|12782
"My first thought was 'Fuck, I even fail at trying to kill myself.'"""|12782
"After a few minutes of crying my reaction went to '""what the fuck am I trying to do?'"""|12782
[BK][BK]About 3 years later I tried again but this time decided that I would cut my arm.|12782
"As I sat there bleeding I again thought '""why am I doing this?'"""|12782
and stopped the bleeding, went and got help and have been good since.|12782
"I realized that I did not want to die, especially in THAT moment.  """|12782
i did not exactly realize what i had tried to do for about a week.|12782
i do not remember what exactly i felt like for that week but when i realized what i had done i was scared of myself and glad it did not work.|12782
it has been 2 years and i am a completely different person with the most positive view on life and am happier than ever.|12782
things get better anyone who is struggling get help and you can turn yourself around|12782
I have attempted suicide multiple times throughout my life, the last time being in 2013.|12782
I had taken a bottle of Benadryl, 7 Klonopin, and a handful of antidepressants.|12782
I laid down on my bed expecting to die but instead had the weirdest trip of my life, so needless to say my thoughts were not exactly conscious for quite a while after that.|12782
When I got home from the hospital my room was pretty much covered in a layer of pink puke.|12782
[BK][BK]|12782
I tried to OD on medicine when I was 15.|12782
It was the night of the spring dance, so all of my friends were out.|12782
I texted my goodbyes, grabbed all of the medication in the house, and started to pour.|12782
I became extremely tired, put down the last handful, and fell asleep.|12782
"When I woke up, I think I thought 'I wonder if anyone noticed'""."|12782
My phone was ringing off the hook from three or four of my friends.|12782
My mom was asleep downstairs, she had no idea.|12782
I answered the call, let them know I am alive.|12782
I sat up, put the remaining medication in the bottles, and put them back.|12782
Stuffed my note in my bedside table, went downstairs, and deleted the goodbye from my mom''s phone.|12782
[BK][BK]I was admitted to the psych ward about two months later when I told a teacher that I should be on suicide watch.|12782
He asked if I was serious, he said yes, and brought me to the counselor.|12782
He went and retrieved the police officer, even though he was in the middle of class and cannot be away for that long.|12782
[BK][BK]I was more grateful for that man than I thought I could be.|12782
"I credit him with my life. """|12782
'Oh no, I even fucked that up.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I ran in front of a speeding car and was hit."|12782
[BK][BK]I got smacked so hard that I skidded on the ground and my shoes were knocked off.|12782
I thought I was lucky until I realized how much of my ass skin was missing and how much my head hurt.|12782
Then fast forward a couple of days, I am more depressed than ever and I resolved to never tell anyone out of shame.|12782
[BK][BK]The shame of failing.|12782
"Nowadays I tell the story and it is the funniest thing in the world. """|12782
Ouch.|12782
My belt broke and I fell out of the tree.|12782
[BK][BK]***Edited for the whole story when I returned from Chic-Fila[BK][BK]It started off as a stupid move on my part over a pointless argument with my Mother.|12782
I have a history of Manic Depression and I had thought about suicide a lot.|12782
I never went all out before, though.|12782
I ran outside and climbed a tree, wrapped my belt around my neck/tree, and pushed off from the branch.|12782
The belt broke after a few seconds and I fell to the ground.|12782
That is when I thought ouch and screw this, I am going to eat a bottle of generic Advil.|12782
I was then informed by my Mother that the pills would not really hurt me, except for probable my liver.|12782
I then called my Friend to come get me, so we could drive around or go see his Brother.|12782
His Brother also had a history of trying to kill himself and I thought that maybe talking to someone else who suffered from depression would help.|12782
My Friend informed that his Father was home and we both did not really like being around him.|12782
We drove around for a few hours getting stoned and then the guilt hit me.|12782
I had to go home and apologize for my stupid actions before my Mother went to sleep.|12782
My Friend then tried to talk me into going to his house to say hi to his Brother, but conceded that we were all going job hunting in the morning, so we could meet up then.|12782
I got dropped off, apologized to my Mother, and then got paranoid about falling asleep with all the Advil in my belly.|12782
I finally passed out at around five.|12782
Now, I sleep like I am dead and usually nothing can wake me up.|12782
I actually have slept through two hurricanes.|12782
Well, around 6 my eyes opened and I saw the caller id lit up.|12782
I closed my eyes and re-opened them with the phone in my hand and next to my ear.|12782
"'What''s up?'"""|12782
"I  asked and my friend says'"" My brother hung himself last night, can you come over?'"""|12782
Now I had hung myself and I was still breathing, so I asked him if his Brother was okay.|12782
He was not.|12782
I had used a well worn belt, but his brother had used a Nylon rope.|12782
I said okay, see you soon, hung up, closed my eyes, and then realized what was going on.|12782
I ran to my Mother''s room and informed her of what happened.|12782
Our families were real close.|12782
I lived with them for a year and they basically lived with us for around ten years at that point.|12782
My friend was my Sister''s first real boyfriend!|12782
Well my Mother said let us go and we both jumped in different showers, took off driving, and made a fifteen minute trip in four minutes.|12782
We got to the front door and my Friend opened it and just lost it when he saw my Mother.|12782
I went looking for his Mom and she lost it when she saw me.|12782
The police were questioning the Father and the body was in the back yard under a blanket.|12782
My Mother went over to the cop and started chewing his ass over how he was treating my Friend''s Dad.|12782
She was threatened by arrest, but she would not back down.|12782
She won the argument and then called a Priest.|12782
I was in shock.|12782
This is my own A Christmas Carol.|12782
I could not put two and two together.|12782
"I was watching a horrible play entitled '"" How to destroy a Family aka You almost did this to yours'""."|12782
I walked out front and around to the driveway.|12782
I saw the paramedics on the driveway waiting on the cops to finish up so they could take the body away.|12782
I light up a cigarette and walked to the backyard to say good bye to my friend.|12782
I saw the familiar Vans poking out from the blood stained blanket underneath the basketball goal where I learned how to dunk.|12782
I lost it.|12782
What a waste.|12782
It all hit me how horrible this was and how if I had just gone over there last night it might have changed something.|12782
My Mother came outside and looked at me.|12782
Without a word we both knew what the other was thinking.|12782
I was so lucky that my belt broke and I spared my family from this horrible nightmare.|12782
[BK][BK]I went home and called my Father, who was well on his way to exiting our lives for better pastures, and he did not answer the phone instead choosing to draft me a letter.|12782
He gave me some actual parting wisdom.|12782
"'""Suicide is the last selfish act of a selfish person, set to hurt a select group of people.'"""|12782
Now I did not want to hear that at the time, but that final message from him is unfortunately is one of the main reasons I am still here.|12782
Whenever I get too manic and get overwhelmed by the hopelessness, I think about what we went through with my Friend''s suicide and pull back from the line.|12782
I can understand that sometimes it is overwhelming and it weighs so much that some people just cannot take it anymore, but seriously, think about your friends, family, hell even your acquaintances!|12782
The guilt and fallout from suicide is something that no one can ever forget.|12782
Death will come for all of us soon enough, so do not throw away what little time you have if for nothing else than the people you love.|12782
"[BK][BK]Sorry for dragging on and if anyone has any questions due to my rambling style of writing, let me know."""|12782
'Well that was scary.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I realized I forgot to take the safety off, and kind of just rethought what I was doing."""|12782
First thought was that maybe there was a reason it had not worked.|12782
Maybe there was something on this Earth that I had to accomplish and that it was not my time yet.|12782
"'Great, I am a failure at even this.'"""""|12782
I hung myself with a guitar patch cable.|12782
I blacked out.|12782
I am not sure for how long.|12782
My brother somehow heard what I was doing.|12782
He was on the second floor and I was literally hanging in the basement.|12782
I did not really have a first conscious thought until my brother cut me down and hugged me.|12782
I felt an overwhelming sense of shock and relief when the cable was cut.|12782
I remember being horrified from being so close to death.|12782
My memory about it is hazy.|12782
But I remember screaming for air when I was freed, and the scared, urgent look on my brother's face.|12782
I still have mixed feelings about him saving me.|12782
'I should try again later, after my parents pass on.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Maybe I was overly selifsh at the time but I did not really think how bad they would feel/live were they to find out(they did not, no one did.)"|12782
10ish years later I still feel the same.|12782
I am older, wiser and have quite a bit more life experience now and it is still very much what I want to do but I would rather my parents believe that their (opinion)biggest source of happiness in life is doing well rather than them have to deal with the weight of my death in their final years.|12782
"They do not have much time left so I can ride it out."""|12782
hmmmm.|12782
I do not really remember.|12782
[BK]what I remember is being at the hospital and there was a security guard sitting with me and spongebob cartoons were on the tv and I asked him to change the channel, and I wanted some chicken fingers.|12782
[BK]then the nurse came in, and she was a girl I went to school with, and I just said her name and she said 'I thought I recognized that name on the chart.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]she gave me a shot and then I woke up again about 12 hours later and my first thought was '""why am I here and where are the chicken fingers'"""""|12782
"Something along the lines of 'ouch'"", quickly followed by '""shit, I hear footsteps'""."""|12782
Why did not it work?|12782
I am out of pills|12782
Definitely my first conscious thought was: where the fuck am I?|12782
(The answer to that was in the psychiatric unit of our local hospital).|12782
I was a hanger in my active suicidal days (three months ago).|12782
[BK][BK]Depression is awful, and bipolar disorder is one of those real ass kickers.|12782
Not to say they are not all, bipolar is just the one I have personal experience with.|12782
Manic and depressive episodes take over your life.|12782
It sucks knowing you cannot do much to effect your mood except take your medicines and hope they keep working.|12782
Right now, I am in a manic episode otherwise I would not even post on Reddit out of fear.|12782
[BK][BK]Suicide is not my answer, and I hope it is not yours.|12782
Life is over quickly enough anyways, is not it?|12782
Tried to OD on OTC medications during my freshman year of college.|12782
I did it in the morning and fell asleep, but kept waking up in tons of pain.|12782
At one point I was not sure if I was going to be okay or not, but I considered going two doors down to my RA's room and asking her to call 911, but I did not.|12782
Can't remember if it was because I was hurting too much to move or I just decided not to.|12782
Anyway, I finally got up at about 6 in the afternoon realized that my floor of the dorm was having a meeting and I told my roommate (who thought I was just being lazy all day) and we both went.|12782
[BK][BK]I didnt have any sort of a reaction when I realized it did not work.|12782
I just shrugged it off, but I did eventually tell my parents and got some help a couple of days later.|12782
And i found out last year that i have some liver damage.|12782
Can't finish 1/4 of a martini without getting tipsy.|12782
Well, the first attempt, I really wanted to go out in an interesting way, so I tried to shatter my trachea with a hammer; Due to my endless ineptitude I could not even manage that.|12782
The first conscious thought was sort of a realization of how fucked up it would be for my family to deal with that.|12782
[BK]Moral of the story: Suicide is never the answer.|12782
I do not think I thought anything at all.|12782
[BK]I woke up and yanked out my IV, then I got strapped in.|12782
"I had failed again, it was just kind of an 'ok'"" feel."""|12782
Well I guess I will take the letter off the door...|12782
I felt shame.|12782
I felt like I was so useless and stupid I could not even kill myself properly.|12782
And I was immediately terrified that anyone who knew me would judge me and say my suicide attempt had been all for attention seeking.|12782
To be honest, I do not even remember.|12782
Possibly cause I went down the drug route and I was not right for a few days after.|12782
i had hung myself from a ceiling fan.|12782
I am a light small girl, and was even smaller at the time, roughly 80lbs, and i really thought it would hold as i had slipped replacing the lightbulb once and grabbed onto its base and the stem that attaches the fan to the base and it didnt fall.|12782
whatever, dumb logic, but when i woke up and realized that it had fallen on me after i lost consciousness but not before dying, my first conscious thought was *I am fucked* because i could feel broken glass underneath my face and I was horrified that not only had I lived, but I had scarred my face up.|12782
I had not.|12782
I have to explain to my family.|12782
Mine was definitely 'Fuck.|12782
"I cannot even do that right?!'"""""|12782
"'Time to go to school.'"""|12782
"Woke up the morning after, got out of bed,  puked up blood, took a shower, and drove to school."""|12782
'I literally just attempted suicide in front of my best friend and they did not even try to stop me.|12782
Just looked at me.|12782
And walked away after they saw it.|12782
Wow.|12782
I almost want to live just to spite them.|12782
Almost.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]The thought process was something like that, but obviously less coherent cause I had nearly died."|12782
"[BK][BK]I will give details if people want them. """|12782
Ouch.|12782
[BK][BK]I had bitten my tongue almost in two while fitting.|12782
Ached from head to foot.|12782
Had a bruised sternum.|12782
Drips and monitors wired to me and a nurse threatening to catheterise me.|12782
Not good.|12782
What can I do differently next time to make it work?|12782
"Given that it was an absolutely massive overdose, none of my 'thoughts'"" were coherent for a very long time."|12782
"They revolved around two general themes though: '""Am I mentally handicapped?'"""|12782
"and '""Fuck I was wrong...'""."|12782
[BK][BK]I took a massive dose of everything I had, including about a month of Strattera, and I had resolved to die in solitude.|12782
As I became increasingly unhinged, I remembered that most overdoses did not kill, but instead left a shell that refused to die.|12782
Unable to think of a worse fate, I called the hospital and lost consciousness shortly after.|12782
[BK][BK]My first glimmer of awareness involved a barely conscious me pulling a foot long or so blood-coated plastic rod out of my nose.|12782
I quickly went out again.|12782
"[BK][BK]My first coherent question apparently was '""How damaged is my brain?!"|12782
"'""[BK][BK]But my first real thought when I could understand what happened was definitely '""Fuck, I was wrong...'"" Apparently my heart HAD stopped, and it was quite the battle to save me."|12782
If I had known that, I never would have called the hospital.|12782
"To say that that realization has tormented me ever since, for various reasons, is an understatement."""|12782
"'Shit, if I really wanted to die I would have tried harder, I will try again later after I get my stuff organised'""[BK]I took a bunch of pills in two batches but the first batch made me vomit the second batch and I was just sick for a few days."""|12782
Pretty late, but I have tried twice in the past and failed both times.|12782
"The first thought for me was essentially 'wow I cannot even do this right.'"""|12782
""""|12782
"'I was so close'""  [BK][BK]Was on life support after an OD and I was pissed"""|12782
I just a tool bunch of pills of whatever I had.|12782
[BK][BK]It did not work.|12782
I just got really nauseous.|12782
Didn't even throw up.|12782
[BK][BK]I did it the day after my grandmother told me she did not care if I committed suicide or not but just not to do it in her house.|12782
She did not want to deal with it.|12782
[BK][BK]If I continued to live with her I probably would have tried again.|12782
[BK][BK]I did not really have many thoughts.|12782
I was just convinced that I probably just damaged my organs.|12782
[BK][BK]I am okay and that was a few years ago.|12782
My life is fantastic after moving away.|12782
r/raisedbynarcissists helped me come to terms with leaving the only family I had left.|12782
those are pretty bad suicide attempts..|12782
My first thought?[BK][BK]'Fuck.|12782
what did I do?|12782
"'""[BK][BK]I have no recollection of wanting to commit suicide."|12782
I just decided to go to sleep, and woke up in the hospital after I had taken over 10x the lethal dose of Ativan.|12782
Apparantly I wrote a note (and a coherent one, at that) and told everyone goodbye.|12782
"[BK][BK]I still have no idea what the hell happened, and everyone knows that I do not want to know."""|12782
Got lied to and used hardcore by a female I was planning to giving my all too.|12782
Essentially cheated on me after having led me to believe she was this person who hated liars.|12782
To this day she does not care about what she did and lies to herself about what we had.|12782
[BK][BK]My first thought was I wish I had not failed.|12782
I still feel that way.|12782
All day.|12782
Everyday.|12782
My first initial thought when I woke up was 'fuck.|12782
I cannot even do THIS correctly.|12782
"'""[BK][BK]Everyday is a battle while having depression."|12782
It''s often tough to not listen to those suicidal thoughts.|12782
A few years after my attempts, I still think of myself as a failure for not being able to actually do it, but it is something I can live with.|12782
"[BK]"""|12782
My first thought was 'Fuck, my throat hurts, and these bruises are gonna be really difficult to hide...|12782
I am tired...|12782
"This did not happen.'"""""|12782
Oh god, my parents are gonna be so pissed.|12782
I need to get to work, I am late.|12782
It was a different experience, and it is kind of hard to explain how I felt.|12782
But that is the first thing that popped into my head that morning.|12782
I tried taking a bunch of painkillers when I was about 16.|12782
My parents had gone through an horrendous divorce, I was dating someone terrible for me, I was failing school, and had this crippling depression since I was nine.|12782
I had been addicted to prescription drugs for a while and I guess I either did not take enough or my tolerance was too high.|12782
I just slept and threw up a lot.|12782
Then when I sort of came to, I was still heavy under the effects of the pills and sort of attacked my mother (not my proudest moment).|12782
She grabbed my arm and I clawed her trying to get away from her.|12782
Ick.|12782
[BK][BK][BK]When I fully regained lucidity, I just cried a lot.|12782
I hated myself for it not working, but I also hated everything about who I was.|12782
I remember feeling like a disappointment to myself and how utterly defeated I felt when I realized I had to still be me.|12782
After slitting my wrists and blacking out I woke up in a hospital bed.|12782
Alone in the dark and restrained to the bed.|12782
The only thing I could think of how easy it was.|12782
A lot simpler than I figured it would have been.|12782
After that the only worries I had were about the process of getting things back to normal.|12782
It was not easy.|12782
Not at all.|12782
"I remember thinking something along the lines of, 'This is not set up correctly.'"""|12782
Partial hanging ended up being more difficult than I had expected, so I was fairly reluctant in fear of it not working and my mother consequently finding me still alive.|12782
[BK][BK]I had been sitting on my bedroom floor beneath the doorknob, hardly able to breathe, to the sound of beautiful classical music playing on my radio.|12782
It took maybe ten minutes before I gave up, thought the phrase above, hid the rope, and went back to bed.|12782
It was 10AM.|12782
"I was supposed to be at school."""|12782
Took a bunch of pills then went to sleep.|12782
My best friend knew I had been having a hard time and woke me up at 4 in the afternoon.|12782
My first conscious thought was that I was embarrassed that I had thrown up in my sleep, followed by realizing how hungry I was.|12782
We went to Subway afterwards.|12782
Thank you.|12782
Almost 2 years ago I attempted to overdose, woke up in the hospital...I just got sick of the verbal and emotional abuse of my parents and I did not see any other way out at the time...|12782
When I woke up i felt even worse...|12782
I had lost my fiance...|12782
He broke up with me because he did not want to be with a crazy person...|12782
I am doing better now I moved out and have a job and am looking to go back to school.|12782
Failing at this is quite embarrassing.|12782
(something like that)|12782
Rage.|12782
Blind fucking rage.|12782
I was in and out of consciousness for a few days but that is all I remember feeling until I got transferred and sedated a bit.|12782
I was pretty hungover, covered in blood and wondered why my throat hurt so much.|12782
I think my first thought more of a mental push to focus up and try to appear sober for my morning routine.|12782
No easy task after a whole bottle of oxy.|12782
I am going to have to tell my Mum.|12782
Honestly, I was just really confused and wanted to go back to sleep.|12782
I was intubated so I had this big hard tube down my throat and one in my nose and I remember just wanting to make them go away.|12782
I could feel the ventilator pushing air in and out, it was horrible.|12782
Then they sedated me a bit more and I was out for the next day or so until I was stable enough to wake up properly.|12782
All in all, a very uncomfortable and painful experience, 0/10 would not recommend.|12782
Shame, for me it was shame.|12782
Not for not being able to accomplish the suicide, but for giving up and having to face everyone again, with them knowing how weak I was.|12782
[BK][BK]The hardest thing I have done in my life, was telling my GF why I did that, and why I gave up even though I had her (she is the most precious thing I have ever had.|12782
), she did not deserve to go through half what I made her go through.|12782
[BK][BK]I just realized I have never questioned myself this, but I am glad you did Reddit.|12782
Made me smile for being where I am at.|12782
That I was so much of a fuckup that I could not even kill myself properly.|12782
I tried to OD on pills but ended up puking them up after I had driven away from my house, and onto a nearby hill.|12782
"'I cannot even kill myself right'"""""|12782
To all the people in here, the world really needs you.|12782
Desperately|12782
Should have known I would fuck that up too..|12782
Wtf!|12782
Maybe there is a reason why I am not fucking dead.|12782
I cannot even do this right.|12782
Fuck sake.|12782
A few days ago.|12782
[BK][BK]Someone in my school had reported me for making a school shooting joke  (which i should not have done anyway) and I got suspended.|12782
I was always a model student in the AP class.|12782
I have gotten several interest letters from various prestigious colleges.|12782
The fact that a suspension was issued to me rocked my world.|12782
This would prevent me from getting into college.|12782
No one would want someone who was suspended.|12782
That night, I snuck into my father''s office and found his glock.|12782
I stared at it for a good 10 minutes, then loaded it and put it up to my head.|12782
I could not physically pull the trigger.|12782
"This does not quantify as 'surviving'"" but I wanted to share."""|12782
"'I wish my sister had not come home from school early.'"""""|12782
Fuck i am still alive|12782
